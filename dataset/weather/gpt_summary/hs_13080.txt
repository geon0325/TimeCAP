Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature displayed a typical diurnal pattern, starting off cooler in the early hours, warming significantly through the day, and then cooling again toward the evening. There was a noticeable increase in humidity overnight, which remained high throughout the day, potentially contributing to a feeling of mugginess and discomfort. Air pressure showed a slight decreasing trend, indicating a possible change in weather patterns or the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with an increase during the afternoon hours, which could have provided some relief from the day's humidity. The wind direction was predominantly from the south to southeast, which is common for the region and could indicate the transport of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico into the area.
