Over the past 24 hours in New York City, temperatures have seen a gradual increase, peaking during the late afternoon hours before commencing a modest decline towards the evening. Humidity levels started high in the early hours but showed a notable decrease throughout the day, indicative of drier air moving into the area. Air pressure remained relatively stable for the majority of the day, but there was an abrupt and significant drop in the last recorded hour, suggesting the potential onset of a rapid weather change such as a storm. Wind speeds were mostly light to gentle and exhibited some variability, with an increase observed during the afternoon. The wind direction shifted from northeasterly in the early hours to westerly and then to a predominantly southwesterly direction, which could have contributed to the changes in temperature and humidity observed throughout the day.
