Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have exhibited a typical diurnal pattern, with a noticeable increase during daylight hours followed by a decrease after sunset, consistent with the city's coastal climate influences. Humidity levels have remained relatively high throughout the period, suggesting a presence of moisture in the air that could contribute to overcast conditions or fog, especially during the morning and evening hours. Despite minor fluctuations, air pressure has been fairly stable, indicating a likelihood of consistent weather patterns without the immediate approach of significant frontal systems. Wind speeds have been mostly light to moderate, with a notable period of calm winds around midday; such conditions are conducive to the formation of sea breezes, which are characteristic of the region. Wind directions have varied significantly, including periods of northerly and westerly winds, which can influence temperature and fog distribution along the coastline and within the Bay Area.
