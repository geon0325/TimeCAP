Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable increase in the proportion of deaths attributed to influenza or pneumonia, with the ratio rising from 6.06% to a peak of 8.33% before settling at 7.49% in the final week. This trend suggests a significant seasonal impact on mortality rates due to respiratory illnesses, which could strain healthcare resources. The highest absolute number of deaths from influenza occurred in the 18th week with 543 deaths, whereas pneumonia-related deaths peaked in the 8th week with 4418 deaths. Despite fluctuations, the combined mortality from these conditions has remained above the 20-week average of 7.84% for the majority of the time, which may indicate a more severe season or potential issues with prevention and treatment strategies. Healthcare systems may need to allocate more resources towards managing and preventing these illnesses, especially during peak periods of activity.
