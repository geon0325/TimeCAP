Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have shown a slight fluctuating trend with a general cooling during the earlier hours, followed by a modest warming trend later in the day. Humidity levels have remained high throughout the period, suggesting a muggy atmosphere likely contributing to a perception of cooler temperatures than actual. Air pressure has been consistently rising, indicating a period of stable weather likely to persist in the short term. Wind speeds have been mostly light but have increased slightly towards the end of the 24-hour period, with the wind direction shifting from westerly to more northerly. This gradual shift in wind direction combined with rising pressure and high humidity may lead to clearer skies but could also result in cooler night-time temperatures.
