Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant upward trend in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, starting from 2.51% and peaking at 23.65% before declining to 10.26%. Influenza A has been more prevalent than Influenza B throughout the period, with its positivity rate rising sharply from 1.41% to a peak of 18.16% before falling to 3.90%, suggesting a pronounced wave of Influenza A infections. In contrast, Influenza B showed a steadier increase in its positivity rate from 1.11% to a peak of 6.69%, and a less sharp decline to 6.36%, indicating a more sustained presence in the population. The peak in positivity rates for both strains suggests a high transmission period, potentially stressing healthcare resources due to increased patient loads. The recent decline in positivity rates for both influenza strains may indicate the passing of the peak season, but the healthcare system should remain vigilant for potential secondary waves or changes in the trend.
