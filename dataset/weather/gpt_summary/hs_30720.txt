Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable warming trend with temperatures peaking in the late afternoon, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels showed a significant drop as temperatures rose, suggesting an inverse relationship between temperature and humidity throughout the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight increase midday, which could be associated with the transient passage of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with an increase during the warmer part of the day, potentially enhancing the perceived temperature decrease as evening approached. The wind direction varied but predominantly came from the south-southeast to the south-southwest, which is common for Houston and may have contributed to the transport of warmer air from the Gulf of Mexico.
