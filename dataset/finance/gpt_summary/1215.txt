Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown an upward trend, closing higher by about 9.2% from 4166.82 to 4550.43, suggesting a positive sentiment among investors. The VIX, commonly known as the "fear index," has declined from 19.75 to 12.69, indicating a decrease in market volatility and an increase in investor confidence. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 indices have also exhibited upward movements, although the FTSE 100 showed a slight decline in the last trading session, which may signal caution in the European markets. Gold Futures have increased in value from 1996.20 to 2011.80, potentially reflecting investors' hedging against inflation or seeking safe-haven assets amidst geopolitical uncertainties. The USD has strengthened against the JPY but remained relatively stable against the EUR, and slightly appreciated against the CNY, which could affect multinational companies' earnings repatriation and export competitiveness.
