Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a moderate fluctuation in temperature, with a general cooling trend observed during the night that transitioned to a warming trend throughout the day. Humidity levels varied significantly, starting at moderate levels before increasing sharply during the early morning hours, then dropping substantially during the day, suggesting a possible passage of a weather front or localized atmospheric changes. Air pressure remained fairly stable initially but saw a notable increase towards the end of the period, which is indicative of a high-pressure system moving into the area, potentially leading to clearer skies and calmer weather conditions. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with a brief period of higher gusts, and the predominant wind direction shifted from southeasterly to westerly and then varied throughout the period, which could impact marine and coastal conditions. Overall, these indicators suggest a dynamic weather situation with transitioning patterns that could affect outdoor activities and local climate conditions.
