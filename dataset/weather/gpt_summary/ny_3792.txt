Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced relatively stable temperatures with a slight warming trend observed in the most recent readings. Humidity levels started high but saw a significant decrease mid-period, before increasing again slightly towards the current hour. There was a noticeable spike in air pressure, which suggests that a high-pressure system may have moved through the area, potentially bringing clearer skies following the decline in humidity. Wind speeds were mostly moderate, with occasional increases, but the direction remained predominantly from the north, shifting slightly to due north in the latest observations. This consistent wind pattern, combined with the changes in humidity and pressure, could indicate the passage of a frontal system and the arrival of more stable weather conditions.
