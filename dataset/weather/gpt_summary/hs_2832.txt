Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a mild and relatively stable temperature profile, with a slight warming trend during the daytime and a gentle cooling at night. Humidity levels have remained high throughout, indicative of a muggy atmosphere typical for this region, which could lead to some discomfort for residents. Atmospheric pressure has been fairly constant, with a slight fluctuation midday that could have been associated with a transient weather system but overall reflects stable weather conditions. Wind speeds have been mostly light to moderate, with an increase observed in the latter part of the period, which might contribute to a feeling of cooler temperatures despite the actual warmth. Wind direction has been predominantly from the south to southeast, which is usual for Houston and can bring moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, possibly increasing humidity levels further.
