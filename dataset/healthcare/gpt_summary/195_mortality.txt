Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant fluctuation in the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, with a notable peak in weeks 14 and 15, where the ratio dramatically increased to 19.37% and 19.40%, respectively, far exceeding the 20-week average of 7.84%. This surge may be indicative of an outbreak or increased virulence of respiratory diseases during that period. Subsequently, there has been a steady decline in both the number of deaths attributed to Influenza or Pneumonia and their ratio to total deaths, indicating a possible easing of the outbreak or an effective response from healthcare services. However, the last reported ratio of 12.88% remains substantially higher than the initial 5.20% observed at the beginning of the 20-week period, suggesting that the healthcare system should maintain vigilance and preparedness for potential fluctuations. Overall, the data reveals a volatile situation that requires ongoing monitoring and resource readiness to manage fluctuations in respiratory disease-related mortality.
