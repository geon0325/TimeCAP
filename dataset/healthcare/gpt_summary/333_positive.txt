Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable trend in respiratory specimen testing for influenza, with the ratio of positive tests peaking at 9.89% in week 8 and subsequently declining to a low of 0.97% by week 20. This decline indicates a significant reduction in influenza activity, with Influenza A showing a more pronounced decrease (from 9.45% to 0.93%) compared to Influenza B, which remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations around 0.05%. Despite the overall downward trend, the cumulative average positive ratio (6.26%) remains above the threshold for significant public health concern, suggesting that influenza remains a persistent challenge for healthcare systems. The sharp drop in positive Influenza A cases could indicate the end of the seasonal peak or the effectiveness of public health interventions. However, continuous monitoring is essential to anticipate potential resurgences and inform vaccine development and distribution strategies.
