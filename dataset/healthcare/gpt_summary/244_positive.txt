Over the last 20 weeks, the testing for influenza has shown a fluctuating but generally low positivity rate, with an average of 6.26% across the period. The ratio of positive specimens peaked in week 15 at 0.40% but has since decreased, suggesting a possible decline in influenza incidence. Influenza A and B have demonstrated similar patterns in positivity rates, with Influenza B showing slightly higher peaks (0.22% in week 15 compared to Influenza A's 0.17% in the same week). The largest volume of specimens tested occurred in the final week at 16,611, yet the positivity rate remained below the average (0.25%), indicating increased testing did not correspond with a proportional increase in positive cases. This trend suggests that while testing has ramped up, the prevalence of influenza may not be increasing at the same rate, potentially easing the burden on healthcare resources related to influenza management.
