Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a gradual increase in temperature reaching its peak in the late afternoon before slightly decreasing towards the evening. Humidity levels have shown significant fluctuations, with very high relative humidity occurring during the early morning hours, which suggests the possibility of morning fog or dew. Air pressure experienced a noticeable drop towards the latter part of the day, which could indicate the approach of a weather system that may bring changes such as precipitation or wind. Wind speeds remained generally light but picked up in intensity in the evening, while wind direction varied but predominantly came from the south to southeast, which is typical for this region and can bring in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. These combined conditions suggest that Houston may have experienced a warm and muggy day with the potential for evening cooling and possibly some weather instability as indicated by the drop in pressure.
