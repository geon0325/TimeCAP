Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia to total deaths has shown an upward trend, peaking at 10.89% in week 12 before gradually declining to 7.63% in week 20, still below the 20-week average of 7.84%. The total number of deaths saw a significant spike in week 10, coinciding with a dramatic increase in deaths attributed to influenza, which surged from an average of 26 in the preceding weeks to 1165 in week 10, and remained elevated for the following four weeks. Pneumonia-related deaths also increased notably during this period, reaching a peak of 5583 in week 11, which suggests a potential outbreak or seasonal pattern. The subsequent decrease in the mortality ratio from week 13 onwards may indicate a response to medical interventions, vaccination efforts, or the natural decline of seasonal disease patterns. The healthcare system may have experienced increased strain during the peak weeks, necessitating resource reallocation to manage the influx of influenza and pneumonia cases.
