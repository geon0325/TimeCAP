Over the last 20 weeks, the proportion of deaths attributed to influenza or pneumonia has generally exceeded the average ratio of 7.84%, indicating a heightened impact of these illnesses on mortality. The ratio of mortality from these causes peaked in weeks 3 and 4 at over 10.5%, suggesting a particularly severe period for these respiratory illnesses. However, there has been a notable decline in the ratio since then, with the latest figure falling below the average at 5.46%, which may point towards a decreasing trend in the impact of these conditions on overall mortality. Despite this recent decline, the absolute number of deaths from influenza has risen in the last three weeks, reaching a 20-week high in the most recent week, which could indicate an increasing prevalence or severity of influenza cases. The healthcare system should remain vigilant as the dynamic changes in influenza and pneumonia-related mortality may require ongoing adjustments to resource allocation and public health strategies.
