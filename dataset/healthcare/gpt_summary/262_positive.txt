Over the last 20 weeks, the total number of respiratory specimens tested for influenza has increased, peaking at 42,526 tests in the eighth week, followed by fluctuations with a mild decreasing trend towards the 20th week. The number of positive specimens for Influenza A has remained relatively low and stable, with a slight decrease noted in recent weeks, whereas Influenza B showed a significant increase in the number of positive specimens between weeks 7 and 13, with a subsequent decline. The overall ratio of positive specimens peaked at 0.29% in week 10 and has since decreased to 0.12% by week 20, which is below the average positive ratio of 6.26% observed over the period. Influenza B has been consistently more prevalent than Influenza A, with its peak ratio of positive specimens reaching 0.21% in week 13, compared to Influenza A's highest ratio of 0.18% in week 1. This data suggests a potential shift in the dominant influenza strain from B to A and indicates a decrease in overall influenza activity in recent weeks, which may reduce the burden on healthcare resources if the trend continues.
