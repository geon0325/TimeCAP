Over the past 24 hours in New York City, there has been a noticeable warming trend, with temperatures rising from cooler conditions in the early period to milder temperatures later on. Humidity levels experienced significant fluctuations, initially starting lower, spiking midway through the period, and then gradually decreasing toward the end. Air pressure has shown a consistent downward trend, indicative of a developing low-pressure system that could potentially lead to unsettled weather conditions. Wind speeds varied, with calmer conditions in the early hours followed by an increase in intensity, suggesting the possibility of a windy atmosphere accompanying the low-pressure system.
