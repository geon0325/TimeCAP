Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature experienced a gradual decline reaching its lowest point during the early hours before rising again significantly as the day progressed. Throughout this period, humidity levels varied considerably, starting at moderate levels before increasing to saturation and then decreasing to relatively low levels towards the end of the 24-hour period. Air pressure remained relatively stable initially, with a slight increase midday, followed by a more substantial rise towards the end of the observed time period, which could indicate the approach of a high-pressure system potentially leading to clearer skies and calmer conditions. Wind speeds were consistently light, suggesting a calm weather pattern, with wind direction shifting from primarily southerly to easterly and then to a more variable pattern, including a brief westerly turn. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and increasing air pressure suggests that Houston may be experiencing fair weather with a possible trend towards drier and more stable conditions.
