Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature from late afternoon to early morning, followed by a warming trend later in the day. Relative humidity values have fluctuated significantly, with notable dips during the warmest parts of the day and a sharp increase during the cooler morning hours, suggesting the presence of moisture that may have contributed to foggy conditions. Air pressure has shown minor fluctuations but generally remained steady, which indicates stable weather patterns without significant frontal activity.
