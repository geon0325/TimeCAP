The analysis of the 20-week ILI data indicates a gradual upward trend in the ratio of ILI patients, starting from below baseline levels and escalating toward the end of the period, ultimately surpassing the baseline threshold. Notably, the increase in ILI cases is most pronounced among the 0-4 and 5-24 age groups, which could suggest higher transmission rates or susceptibility within these populations. The steady rise in ILI incidence across all age groups reflects a growing burden on the healthcare system, particularly in pediatric and young adult populations. As the ILI ratio has recently crossed the baseline, healthcare providers should be prepared for continued or increased demand for medical services, including diagnostics, treatment, and potential hospitalizations. Public health authorities may need to consider reinforcing preventative measures or public awareness campaigns to mitigate the spread, especially in highly affected age groups.
