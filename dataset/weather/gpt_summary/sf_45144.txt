Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, the weather has exhibited an unusual pattern of consistency across multiple indicators. The temperature has remained constant at a level that is significantly higher than the typical range for this region, suggesting an atypical heat event. Humidity levels have also been unchanging and are particularly low, which could contribute to dry conditions and potentially increase the risk of wildfires. Air pressure has shown no variation, indicating a stable atmospheric condition that is likely suppressing the development of significant weather changes. Meanwhile, the wind has been steady both in speed and direction, maintaining a gentle breeze from the southeast, which may provide some relief from the heat but is not strong enough to significantly disrupt the current weather pattern.
