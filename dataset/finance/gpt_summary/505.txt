Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with an initial uptrend followed by a sharp decline and a slight recovery, ending at 3773.86, which suggests a degree of investor uncertainty. The VIX has mirrored this uncertainty, spiking to 37.21 mid-period, indicating increased market volatility and risk aversion, before settling back down to 30.24. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have also experienced fluctuations, with the Nikkei closing higher from its starting point, while the FTSE 100 ended lower, reflecting mixed sentiment across global markets. Commodity prices saw Gold Futures rebounding from a dip to close higher at 1860.80, signaling a possible safe-haven demand amidst market instability, whereas Crude Oil Futures remained relatively stable, closing slightly higher, which could indicate a steadier demand outlook. Finally, the foreign exchange rates have shown a slight weakening of the USD against major currencies, with EUR/USD and USD/CNY pairs indicating a stronger Euro and Yuan respectively, while the USD strengthened against the JPY, which could suggest regional economic dynamics affecting currency strengths.
