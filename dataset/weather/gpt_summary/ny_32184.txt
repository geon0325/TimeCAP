Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a modest increase in temperature, transitioning from mild to warmer conditions. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, initially high, then decreasing during the warmest part of the day, and increasing again towards the end of the 24-hour period, suggesting a typical diurnal pattern. Air pressure showed a gradual decrease, which could indicate an approaching weather system with the potential for changing weather conditions. Wind speeds remained generally light but picked up in the later hours, which, combined with the falling pressure, could suggest an increased likelihood of upcoming windier conditions.
