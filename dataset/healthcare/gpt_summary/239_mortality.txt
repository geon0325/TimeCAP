Over the past 20 weeks, there has been an observable upward trend in the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia relative to the total number of deaths, significantly exceeding the average ratio of 7.84%. The initial weeks showed a ratio well above the average, starting at 12.71% and peaking at 17.30% by the end of the period, indicating a possible outbreak or increased virulence. Despite fluctuations, the mortality from these diseases has escalated, with the number of deaths from pneumonia more than doubling from 8489 to 14293, while deaths from influenza showed a more modest increase. The total number of deaths also increased over this period, suggesting a broader rise in mortality that could be stressing healthcare resources. This trend of rising Influenza and Pneumonia mortality, especially in the context of the overall increase in deaths, may warrant public health interventions and increased healthcare preparedness to manage the growing burden of respiratory illnesses.
