Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has exhibited volatility with an overall downward trend, closing lower by approximately 3.2% from the starting value, despite some intermittent recoveries. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, has fluctuated but remained elevated, suggesting investor uncertainty, with a noticeable peak corresponding with the S&P 500's lowest points. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 both reflected similar downward trends in their respective markets, with the FTSE 100 showing a more pronounced decline of approximately 7.5%. Gold Futures have seen an upward movement, indicating a possible flight to safety among investors, while Crude Oil Futures experienced a significant drop of over 13%, likely influenced by concerns over global economic growth. Exchange rates have shown lesser volatility; however, the USD strengthened against the JPY and fluctuated marginally against the EUR and CNY, which could impact international trade dynamics and export competitiveness.
