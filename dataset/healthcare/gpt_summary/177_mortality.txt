Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia as a proportion of total deaths has shown a decreasing trend, with the initial weeks hovering above the 20-week average of 7.84% and later weeks falling below it. The percentage peaked at 10.72% in week 11 but has since declined, reaching its lowest points at 5.20% and 5.27% in the last two weeks. Despite the overall decrease in the mortality ratio, the absolute number of deaths attributed to pneumonia has been significantly higher than those from influenza, with pneumonia cases consistently contributing to the majority of the Influenza or Pneumonia-related mortality. Interestingly, the total number of deaths has a slight peak around weeks 7 and 8, but this does not correlate with a proportional increase in Influenza or Pneumonia deaths, suggesting that other factors may have influenced the overall mortality during those weeks. The decline in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia in recent weeks could indicate a potential reduction in the spread or severity of these illnesses, or an improvement in their management and treatment, which could alleviate some of the pressure on healthcare resources if this trend continues.
