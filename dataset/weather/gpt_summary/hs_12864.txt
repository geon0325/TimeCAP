Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature experienced a gradual increase, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before slowly declining towards the evening, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels showed a slight decrease as the temperature peaked, which is common due to the inverse relationship between temperature and relative humidity. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a minor fluctuation, suggesting no significant weather fronts moving through the area during this time frame. Wind speeds were generally light and variable, with occasional calm conditions, which could lead to the formation of fog or mist if combined with the high humidity levels observed. Wind direction was predominantly from the south, with some variability, a pattern often associated with warm air advection in this region.
