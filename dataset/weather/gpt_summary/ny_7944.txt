Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a notable fluctuation in temperature, starting off warm, cooling slightly, and then peaking again in the later hours. Humidity levels varied significantly, with very high readings during cooler periods, suggesting the possibility of fog or mist, and lower levels during the warmer phases which indicates clearer conditions. The air pressure saw a dramatic drop in the mid-period, which could be indicative of a passing front or weather system, potentially leading to unstable weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate with some increase around the same time as the peak temperatures, hinting at the possibility of gusty conditions accompanying the warmer weather. The wind direction shifted throughout the day, predominantly coming from a northerly direction before moving to a southerly direction and then varying once more, which could have contributed to the temperature changes and variability in the weather patterns observed.
