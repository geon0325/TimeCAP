Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced relatively stable temperatures with slight fluctuations, indicating a generally consistent weather pattern. Humidity levels reached saturation during certain hours, which could have led to fog formation or a feeling of increased mugginess, but these levels also saw some decreases, possibly related to changes in temperature or wind patterns. Air pressure remained fairly steady, with minor variations, suggesting stable weather conditions without the presence of significant fronts or storms. Wind speeds varied from light to moderate, with peak gusts occurring later in the period, potentially affecting loose objects and contributing to a slight wind chill effect. The predominant wind direction shifted throughout the day, most notably veering from northeasterly to southeasterly, which could have influenced local temperature and humidity levels due to the movement of air masses.
