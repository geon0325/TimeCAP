Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have exhibited a gradual warming trend, starting from below average early morning values to above average in the late afternoon, indicative of a typical diurnal pattern. Humidity levels have varied considerably, with a notable increase during the early hours, possibly due to overnight cooling leading to condensation, and a subsequent decrease during the day as temperatures rose. Air pressure has shown a slight decreasing trend throughout the day, which could suggest the approach of a weather system that may alter current conditions. Wind speeds have remained consistently light, with only a brief period of slightly higher winds, suggesting calm weather conditions. Wind direction has been predominantly stable with a sudden shift to the south, which could introduce moisture and warmer air into the region, potentially affecting local weather patterns.
