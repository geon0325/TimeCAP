Over the last 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, suggesting a warming trend moving through the area. Humidity levels saw a significant drop, indicating drier air has moved in, which often brings clearer skies and less chance for precipitation. Air pressure initially rose slightly but then underwent a substantial decrease before stabilizing, hinting at the possible passage of a front followed by more stable conditions. Wind speeds were variable but included a period of gustiness, potentially leading to wind chill effects that could have made the temperatures feel cooler than the actual readings. The wind direction fluctuated throughout the day, with notable shifts that could be associated with changing weather patterns, such as a frontal passage or the influence of local geographic features on wind flow.
