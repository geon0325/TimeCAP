Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has displayed a gradual increase, indicating a warming trend leading into the current time. Humidity levels have fluctuated but are showing an upward trend in the most recent hours, suggesting an increase in atmospheric moisture that could lead to a feeling of mugginess or the potential for precipitation. Air pressure has been steadily decreasing, which is often associated with the approach of a low-pressure system that could result in unsettled weather conditions. Wind speeds have been relatively light but increased during the latter part of the period, which might contribute to the dispersion of humidity and potentially affect localized weather patterns. Finally, the wind direction has been variable, predominantly coming from the east and shifting towards the south, which could be influencing the current temperature and humidity levels as air masses move through the region.
