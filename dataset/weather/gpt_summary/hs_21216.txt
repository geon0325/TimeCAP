Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, transitioning from warm conditions towards notably cooler temperatures by the end of the observed period. Humidity levels remained high throughout, often reaching saturation, which could indicate the presence of fog or mist, especially during the cooler night and early morning hours. Air pressure saw a steady increase, suggesting the strengthening of a high-pressure system over the area, which is typically associated with stable weather conditions.

The wind direction varied, including a notable shift, which may be indicative of a changing weather system moving through the Houston area.
