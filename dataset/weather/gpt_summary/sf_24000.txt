Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have shown a typical diurnal pattern with a notable increase during daylight hours followed by a gradual decrease after sunset. Humidity levels have remained relatively high throughout the period, indicating a significant amount of moisture in the air, which could lead to a feeling of mugginess or the potential for fog, especially during the cooler night and early morning hours. Air pressure experienced a mid-day increase, which is often associated with more stable weather conditions, but the subsequent decrease towards the evening could suggest a shift towards a less stable atmosphere. Wind speeds were mostly moderate with some increase during certain hours, which could contribute to dispersion of any fog that forms overnight. Wind direction varied, predominantly coming from the west and then shifting to include northerly and easterly components, which is common for coastal cities like San Francisco and can influence local temperature and fog patterns.
