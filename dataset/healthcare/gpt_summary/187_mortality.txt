Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia to the total number of deaths has shown a decreasing trend from an initial high of 10.72% to a low of 5.20%, before rising again to 6.13% in the latest week. The total number of deaths fluctuated, with an initial decrease followed by a gradual rise, peaking at 63576 in the first week and reaching 57399 by the final week. Deaths from pneumonia have decreased significantly from 6805 to 3392, while deaths from influenza have shown an overall increase, starting at 10 and rising to 129 in the last week. The ratio of deaths from Influenza or Pneumonia to total deaths has mostly remained below the 20-week average of 7.84%, suggesting a lower impact of these illnesses on overall mortality in this period compared to historical averages. However, the recent uptick in the mortality ratio alongside the rise in influenza deaths could indicate a potential emerging public health concern that warrants closer monitoring and possibly increased healthcare preparedness.
