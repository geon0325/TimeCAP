Over the last 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable diurnal variation in temperature, with the lowest values observed during the early morning hours and the peaks occurring in the late afternoon. Humidity levels have shown a downward trend throughout the day, which typically suggests drier air moving into the area. Air pressure has been relatively stable, with a slight increase during the morning, followed by a gradual decrease, indicating steady weather conditions but with potential for minor changes. Wind speeds have varied, with stronger gusts in the earlier hours that gradually weakened towards the evening, suggesting a lessening of any wind-related impacts as the day progressed.
