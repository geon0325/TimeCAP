Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a notable warming trend, with temperatures climbing gradually to reach a peak in the late afternoon before slightly decreasing towards the evening. Humidity levels have shown significant variation, starting moderately high in the early hours, spiking to full saturation, then dropping and fluctuating in the latter part of the day, potentially affecting the comfort levels and precipitation likelihood in the area. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight overall decrease, which could be indicative of a persistent weather pattern or the approach of a new system. Wind speeds were moderate and variable, with a general decrease in speed throughout the day, which might have contributed to the increase in temperature. Wind direction was predominantly from the south to south-east and shifted towards a southerly and south-westerly direction in the afternoon, which is typical for warm air movement in the region.
