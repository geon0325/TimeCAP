Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant fluctuation in the mortality rate from Influenza or Pneumonia, with a noticeable peak in the ratio of deaths from these causes to total deaths, reaching a high of 18.51% before declining to 9.59% in the most recent week. This peak surpasses the average ratio of 7.84% by a considerable margin, indicating a period of heightened impact from these illnesses. The total number of deaths peaked at 84,224 in week 10, correlating with the highest number of deaths from pneumonia (14,894) in the same week, though the peak for influenza-related deaths occurred later, with 187 deaths in week 12. After the peak, there has been a general downward trend in deaths from both Influenza and Pneumonia, with pneumonia deaths decreasing more rapidly than those from Influenza. This trend could suggest a gradual easing of the burden these illnesses place on the healthcare system, but continued monitoring is essential to manage potential future outbreaks and allocate healthcare resources effectively.
