Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a general decline in both the absolute number of deaths attributed to influenza or pneumonia and their proportion relative to total deaths. The mortality ratio from these causes has decreased from a high of 7.81% in the first week to a low of 5.64% in the penultimate week, with a slight increase to 5.70% in the last week. The total number of deaths has fluctuated but shows a modest downward trend, while deaths from influenza have notably decreased from 273 to 30. Deaths from pneumonia have also decreased from 4605 to 3178. This overall downward trend in influenza and pneumonia mortality may suggest an improvement in public health measures or seasonal variation, but it remains a significant concern, comprising around 6% of all deaths by the end of the observed period.
