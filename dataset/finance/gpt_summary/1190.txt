Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has exhibited a downward trend, decreasing from 4337.44 to 4224.16, suggesting a cautious or bearish sentiment among investors. The VIX, commonly known as the fear gauge, has increased from 16.90 to 21.71, indicating heightened market volatility and investor uncertainty. International markets have mirrored this cautious sentiment, with Japan's Nikkei 225 and the UK's FTSE 100 both declining, signaling potential concerns over global economic health. Gold futures have bucked the trend, rising from 1916.60 to 1982.50, which may reflect a flight to safety as investors seek traditional safe-haven assets amidst market turbulence. Meanwhile, the currency markets have shown relative stability in the EUR/USD and an incremental increase in the USD/CNY exchange rates, while the USD/JYP remained largely flat, suggesting that currency traders may be taking a wait-and-see approach amidst broader market uncertainty.
