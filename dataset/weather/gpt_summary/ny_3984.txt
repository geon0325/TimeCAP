Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a slight decrease in temperature, exhibiting the typical diurnal cooling cycle overnight. Relative humidity levels have fluctuated considerably, reaching a peak coinciding with the lowest temperatures, which is common as cooler air holds less moisture, making it more saturated. Air pressure has shown variability with a notable increase, indicative of a potential change in weather patterns, possibly the movement of a high-pressure system into the area. Wind speeds have been generally light to moderate and have varied in direction, suggesting a lack of a dominant weather front and the presence of local or transient weather systems. The combination of these factors points to variable weather conditions, with potential shifts in temperature and possibly clearer skies following the rise in air pressure.
