Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature with a peak during the afternoon, followed by a slight dip towards the evening. Humidity levels showed a decreasing trend through the day, which is typical as temperatures rise, indicating drier conditions as the day progressed. Air pressure remained relatively stable but saw a significant increase mid-day, which could suggest the influence of a high-pressure system moving through the area. Wind speeds were generally light and variable, with occasional calm conditions, and a more pronounced increase in the afternoon. The wind direction shifted throughout the day, starting from southeasterly, becoming variable when the wind was calm, and then predominantly coming from a southerly direction, which could bring warmer air from the Gulf of Mexico.
