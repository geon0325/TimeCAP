Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a downward trend, falling from 4483.87 to 4201.09, indicating increased bearish sentiment among investors. This sentiment is mirrored by the VIX, commonly known as the fear index, which has risen from 22.86 to 36.45, suggesting heightened market volatility and uncertainty. Both the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have also experienced declines, with the Nikkei dropping significantly from 27248.87 to 25221.41, and the FTSE 100 retreating from 7573.50 to 6959.50, pointing towards broader global market concerns. In contrast, Gold Futures have surged from 1820.60 to 1993.90, reflecting its status as a safe-haven asset amid market turmoil, while Crude Oil Futures have escalated sharply from 91.32 to 119.40, which could indicate supply concerns and inflationary pressures. The currency markets have seen the EUR/USD exchange rate drop from 1.15 to 1.09, and the USD strengthening against both JPY and CNY, which may suggest a flight to the perceived safety of the USD amid global financial instability.
