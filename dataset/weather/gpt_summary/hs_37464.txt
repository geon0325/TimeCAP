Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon hours before slightly declining towards the evening. Relative humidity levels varied significantly, peaking during the early morning hours indicative of possible morning fog or dew, and then dropping as temperatures rose, which is typical for diurnal patterns. Air pressure showed a steady decrease throughout the day, which could suggest the approach of a weather system that might lead to changing weather conditions, such as increased cloudiness or chances of precipitation. Wind speed varied, with notable increases towards the later part of the day, potentially contributing to a windier and possibly cooler evening. Lastly, the wind direction was predominantly from the south to the southeast, which in Houston can often bring increased moisture and may contribute to higher humidity and cloud cover.
