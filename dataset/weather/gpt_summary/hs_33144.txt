Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has experienced a gradual decrease during the early hours, followed by a significant increase midday, and a slight decrease towards the current hour, indicating a typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels have shown an inverse relationship to temperature, with the highest humidity occurring during the coolest part of the day and decreasing as temperatures rose, which is characteristic of the local climate's response to heating. Air pressure remained relatively stable with only minor fluctuations, suggesting a steady atmospheric condition without the immediate influence of any strong weather systems. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate throughout the period, with no significant gusts, providing little relief from the heat during the warmest parts of the day. Wind direction was predominantly from the south to the southeast, which in Houston often contributes to warmer conditions due to the transport of warm air from the Gulf of Mexico.
