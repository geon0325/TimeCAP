Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a general uptrend, increasing from 3990.97 to 4137.29, indicative of growing investor confidence or a positive response to macroeconomic factors. The VIX, or Volatility Index, has remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, ending slightly higher at 20.34 from a starting point of 19.36, suggesting a consistent level of market volatility without any extreme investor fear or complacency. The Nikkei 225 witnessed a steady climb, reflecting optimism in the Asian markets, while the FTSE 100 showed a more pronounced increase, particularly towards the end of the period, which might correlate with positive market or economic developments in the UK. Gold Futures experienced a downward trend, moving from 1907.20 to 1851.90, possibly due to investors shifting towards riskier assets as reflected by the equity market gains. The currency markets observed a slight depreciation of the Euro and the Japanese Yen against the US Dollar, with EUR/USD moving from 1.08 to 1.07 and USD/JPY rising from 128.32 to 131.55, while the Chinese Yuan saw a marginal increase in the USD/CNY rate from 6.73 to 6.81, potentially indicating market preference for the dollar during this period.
