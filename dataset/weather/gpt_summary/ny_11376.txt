Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a notable drop in temperature, transitioning from relatively stable conditions to much cooler temperatures. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly throughout this period, with a general trend towards higher humidity following the temperature decrease. Air pressure showed a decreasing trend, which often correlates with changing weather patterns and could indicate the approach of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds varied, with a period of calm winds followed by an increase, including a peak that could have intensified the wind chill effect felt by residents.
