Over the last 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, peaking during the afternoon hours, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels have fluctuated, dropping significantly midday before rising again towards the evening, which could have affected the perceived comfort level throughout the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable until a sharp rise was observed, suggesting the possible approach of a high-pressure system that could lead to clearer skies and calmer conditions. Wind speeds varied modestly, with a period of calm and then increased activity, potentially contributing to variations in temperature and humidity. The wind direction shifted throughout the day, primarily from northerly to southerly and back, possibly associated with the passage of a minor weather front or localized pressure changes.
