Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a general downward trend in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for both influenza A and B, with a notable peak in the initial weeks. The ratio of positive specimens for influenza B is consistently higher than that for influenza A, although both subtypes show a significant decrease from their initial values of 9.54% and 5.57% to 0.32% and 0.63%, respectively, by the end of the period. The overall positivity rate for influenza has decreased sharply from 15.11% to below the 20-week average of 6.26%, settling at 0.96% in the final week. This decline in influenza positivity suggests a current low level of influenza circulation, which may reduce the burden on healthcare resources related to influenza management. However, healthcare systems should remain vigilant for possible future surges, as influenza patterns are often unpredictable and can change rapidly.
