Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a fluctuating trend in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a recent notable decrease to 1.31% in the latest week from a peak of 3.46% five weeks prior. While both Influenza A and B have been present, Influenza B displayed a significant spike in positive cases around the 15th week, reaching a ratio of 2.10%, but subsequently dropped to 0.62% by the 20th week. In contrast, Influenza A has shown a more stable pattern with less variability in its positive ratio, although it also experienced a decline to 0.69% in positivity by the 20th week. The total number of specimens tested increased consistently over the period, suggesting heightened surveillance or possibly increasing incidence of respiratory illness, peaking at 19,851 tests conducted in the final week. The observed downward trend in positive influenza specimens, particularly in the context of increased testing, may signal a waning phase of the influenza season, yet continued vigilance is necessary as fluctuations in influenza activity can have significant impacts on healthcare resource allocation and public health strategies.
