Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have experienced a mild fluctuation, starting off warmer in the early periods, cooling down, and then increasing again towards the end of the time series, indicative of diurnal variation. Humidity levels have shown significant variability, with a notable drop in the afternoon hours, suggesting a possible brief period of drier conditions, followed by a return to higher humidity levels. Air pressure has been relatively stable with a slight decreasing trend, possibly suggesting a minor change in weather patterns or the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds increased towards the latter part of the day, indicating more active weather conditions, and wind directions have varied widely, suggesting that winds have been shifting and not dominated by a consistent weather system.
