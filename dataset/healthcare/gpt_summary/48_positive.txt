Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant increase in the proportion of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the overall positivity ratio rising from 1.46% to 18.29%. This upward trend is primarily driven by a surge in Influenza A cases, which saw an increase in positivity from 0.74% to 16.50%, while Influenza B also rose but to a lesser extent, from 0.72% to 1.78%. The total number of specimens tested peaked at week 20 with 36,732 tests, suggesting heightened surveillance and possibly increased incidence of respiratory illness. The highest week-over-week increase in the ratio of positive specimens occurred between weeks 15 and 16, where the rate nearly doubled from 6.68% to 10.78%. This substantial rise in influenza activity may indicate a need for increased healthcare resources, including hospital beds, antiviral medications, and healthcare personnel, to manage the growing number of patients.
