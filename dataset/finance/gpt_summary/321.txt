Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 exhibited volatility with an overall upward trend, closing higher by approximately 6.09% from the starting value, indicative of recovering investor confidence. The VIX, known as the market's "fear gauge," has seen a general decrease, ending the period significantly lower by about 32.03%, which aligns with the rebound in the S&P 500 and suggests a reduction in market volatility and investor anxiety. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 both mirrored this positive movement to a lesser extent, with the Nikkei closing up by approximately 5.96% and the FTSE 100 showing a more modest increase of 1.60%, pointing to a cautiously optimistic outlook in these markets.

Gold Futures saw a slight decrease of about 2.00% over the period, reflecting a shift in investor preference towards riskier assets as confidence grows, though the price remains relatively high, indicating ongoing hedging against market uncertainty. Crude Oil Futures experienced extreme volatility, including an unprecedented dip into negative pricing due to storage capacity concerns, but ended with a recovery to $24.74, suggesting the market is still grappling with demand issues amidst the current economic environment.
