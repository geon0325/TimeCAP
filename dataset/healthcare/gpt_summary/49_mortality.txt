Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, with a peak of 10.89% in week 6, exceeding the 20-week average of 7.84%. This peak coincided with a surge in deaths attributed to influenza, which reached its highest at 1626 in the same week. Following this peak, the influenza mortality declined steadily to 119 in week 20, while pneumonia-related deaths also decreased from their highest point of 5583 in week 5 to 3394 in week 20. The overall ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia has shown a downward trend, dropping below the average to 6.54% by the end of the 20-week period. These trends may suggest a seasonal impact on mortality rates, requiring the healthcare system to adjust resources in anticipation of such variations and to continue monitoring these diseases closely to manage potential outbreaks effectively.
