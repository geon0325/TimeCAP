Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has displayed a gradual decrease, indicative of a typical diurnal pattern where the warmest conditions occur during the daytime, cooling off through the evening and into the early morning hours. Humidity levels have fluctuated significantly, with periods of complete saturation suggesting the possibility of fog or mist formation, especially during times when temperature and dew point were close to converging. Atmospheric pressure experienced a slight increase during the period, which is often associated with stable weather conditions and the potential for clearer skies following the trend. Wind speeds have been mostly light to moderate, with occasional higher gusts, while the wind direction has varied considerably, indicating the presence of changing weather systems or localized variations in wind patterns. The combination of high humidity, changing wind directions, and varying pressure suggests the potential for transient weather conditions, including the possibility of precipitation or the development of localized weather events.
