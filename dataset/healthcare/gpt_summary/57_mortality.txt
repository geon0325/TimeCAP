Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia as a percentage of total deaths has shown a gradual decline, starting at 9.71% and ending at 5.63%, with a noticeable decrease from the initial weeks to the concluding weeks. The total number of deaths attributed to Influenza has significantly decreased from 1243 to 7, suggesting a sharp decline in Influenza-related mortality. Pneumonia deaths have also decreased but at a slower rate, from 4689 to 2865, indicating that Pneumonia remains a more significant contributor to the overall mortality than Influenza. The overall trend of decreasing mortality rates from these respiratory diseases may signal an easing burden on the healthcare system, particularly regarding the management of Influenza cases. However, the persistent presence of Pneumonia-related deaths, despite the downward trend, emphasizes the need for ongoing vigilance and healthcare resource allocation for Pneumonia management and prevention.
