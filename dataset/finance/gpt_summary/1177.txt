Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has exhibited a downward trend, decreasing from an initial level of 4465.48 to close at 4229.45, which may signal growing investor caution and a potential shift towards risk-off sentiment. Volatility, as measured by the VIX, has increased concurrently, moving from 14.45 to 19.78, reflecting heightened market uncertainty. International equity markets have similarly faced declines, with Japan's Nikkei 225 dropping from 33241.02 to 31237.94, while the UK's FTSE 100 slid from 7426.10 to 7470.20, indicating widespread concerns across global markets. Commodity prices have seen mixed movements, with Gold Futures declining from 1918.10 to 1824.60, suggesting a potential decrease in safe-haven demand, whereas Crude Oil Futures showed volatility but ended slightly higher at 89.23 compared to an opening of 87.54, which could indicate continuing energy market tightness. Currency markets have seen the USD strengthening against major currencies, with the EUR/USD and USD/CNY exchange rates decreasing, signaling a potential flight to the relative safety of the US dollar amidst global economic uncertainty.
