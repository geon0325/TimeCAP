Over the last 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual decrease in temperature from its peak during the daytime, followed by a slight increase as the day progressed, indicative of typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels fluctuated considerably, peaking during the early morning hours, which, combined with high temperatures, could have contributed to periods of mugginess. Air pressure showed a slight decreasing trend over the period, which may suggest the approach of a weather system that could affect local conditions. Wind speeds remained generally low, with a brief increase later in the period, pointing to mostly calm conditions with a possible exception towards the end. The wind direction varied, predominantly coming from the south to southeast, which is common for Houston and may influence moisture levels and temperature in the area.
