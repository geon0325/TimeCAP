Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with a slight downward trend, declining from an opening of 4496.19 to a close of 4395.64, which may signal growing investor caution. The VIX, also known as the fear gauge, has seen an upward trend during the same period, climbing from 16.79 to 20.87, indicating increased market uncertainty. International markets have also experienced fluctuations, with Japan's Nikkei 225 showing an overall upward movement amidst volatility, while the UK's FTSE 100 has demonstrated a slight downtrend but recovered towards the end of the period. Commodity prices for gold and crude oil futures have both seen increases, with gold remaining relatively stable around the $1780 mark and oil showing a more pronounced rise from $68.36 to $72.23, hinting at potential inflationary pressures. Currency markets have remained relatively stable with minor depreciation of the euro and yen against the dollar, as seen in the EUR/USD and USD/JPY exchange rates, while the USD/CNY pair has stayed fairly constant, which could reflect a steadiness in trade expectations between the US and major trading partners.
