Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak during the later afternoon hours before commencing a typical diurnal decline after sunset. Humidity levels have fluctuated significantly, indicating variable atmospheric moisture, with notably higher humidity during the early morning and late evening, which could contribute to morning and evening fog or dew. Air pressure has shown minor variability, but there was a slight downward trend, which could suggest an approaching weather system or front. Wind speeds remained mostly light throughout the period, with a brief increase at one point, which might have provided a temporary relief from the day's warmth. Wind direction was predominantly from the northeast, shifting to a westerly direction during the afternoon, which is consistent with the passage of a frontal system or the influence of sea-land breeze effects.
