Over the last 24 hours, Houston experienced a moderate temperature fluctuation, with a noticeable warming trend during the daytime hours followed by a slight cooling trend in the late evening. Humidity levels showed a significant decrease through the period, potentially indicating the presence of a dry air mass moving into the region. Air pressure readings varied, with a notable drop midday, which could suggest the passage of a transient weather system, before stabilizing toward the end of the period. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate and increased slightly in the afternoon, which is typical for diurnal heating effects. The wind direction remained fairly consistent, with a slight shift towards the east, which may have contributed to the transportation of drier air into the area.
