Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature with a warming trend observed during the daytime that stabilized toward the evening. Humidity levels have been notably high, with a peak at full saturation, suggesting a potential for fog or precipitation during periods of cooler temperatures. Air pressure has shown minor variability but remained relatively stable, indicating a potential for the current weather pattern to persist. Wind speeds have been mostly light to moderate, with periods of calm and a notable shift in wind direction from predominantly southerly to variable, including a period with northerly winds, which could influence local weather conditions such as temperature and cloud cover. The combination of high humidity, stable air pressure, and variable winds suggests a likelihood of consistent weather conditions, with a chance of morning fog or dew given the observed saturation levels.
