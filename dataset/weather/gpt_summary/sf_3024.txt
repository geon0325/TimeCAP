Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a slight decrease in temperature followed by a gradual increase, indicating a typical diurnal temperature variation with cooler conditions overnight and a warming trend during the day. Humidity levels remained high throughout the period, suggesting a persistent presence of moisture in the air which could lead to a feeling of mugginess or potential fog development, especially during the early morning or late evening hours. Air pressure has seen a gradual decline, which may indicate an approaching weather system that could lead to changes in the current weather pattern. Wind speeds varied, with periods of calm interspersed with moderate gusts; however, the general trend shows a decrease in wind speed towards the end of the 24-hour period. The wind direction was predominantly from the west and northwest, with occasional shifts, which is typical for the San Francisco area due to its coastal location and could influence the local climate by bringing in marine air masses.
