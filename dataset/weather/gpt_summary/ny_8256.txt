Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching a peak in the late afternoon before cooling down slightly towards the evening. Relative humidity levels showed a moderate decrease through the day, which is typical following the peak temperatures of the day, suggesting a level of comfort despite the warmth. A significant drop in air pressure was observed, which could indicate the approach of a weather system that has the potential to bring instability, such as storms or wind gusts. Wind speeds were generally low but picked up later in the day, which, combined with the falling pressure, points towards changing weather conditions. The wind direction varied but showed a tendency to align from south to west, which could be associated with the movement of weather fronts and systems across the region.
