Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced relatively stable temperatures with minor fluctuations, indicative of typical diurnal variation, where temperatures slightly dropped during the night and rose again during the day. Humidity levels have been high, frequently reaching saturation, which could result in a muggy feeling and may have contributed to the development of fog or low clouds, especially when combined with the stable air pressure throughout the period. The air pressure has remained consistent, suggesting a stable weather pattern without the immediate influence of strong weather fronts or systems. Wind speeds have been mostly light to gentle, which is typical for the area and does not suggest any significant weather events. Wind direction has been predominantly from the south-southeast, consistent with a Gulf influence, which often brings moisture and warmer air into the region.
