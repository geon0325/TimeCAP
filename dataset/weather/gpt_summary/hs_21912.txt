Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, indicative of warming weather conditions. The humidity levels showed a decreasing trend as the day progressed, which typically suggests a decrease in moisture content in the air and possibly more comfortable conditions. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, indicating steady weather without the immediate prospect of significant changes such as storms. Wind speeds were generally moderate but showed a slight decrease in the latter part of the day, which may result in less wind chill and more stagnant air conditions. The wind has been consistently blowing from the south, which in Houston could contribute to the warmer temperatures observed, as southern winds often bring warmer air from the Gulf of Mexico.
