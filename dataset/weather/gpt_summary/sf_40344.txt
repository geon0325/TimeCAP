Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual decrease in temperature followed by a moderate increase, suggesting a cooling trend moving into the night with a subsequent warming during the day. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with notably high humidity occurring concurrently with the lowest temperatures, which could have resulted in early morning fog, a common occurrence in the area. Air pressure showed slight variations but remained relatively stable, indicating steady weather conditions without the presence of strong frontal systems. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with an increase during the day that could have contributed to a more brisk feeling for residents and visitors. The wind direction was variable, with a notable shift from predominantly southerly to westerly and northerly directions, which might have influenced the movement of any coastal fog and the dispersion of urban pollution.
