Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a gradual rise in temperature, indicating a warming trend which peaked during the later hours of the period. Humidity showed a general increase towards the end of the 24-hour period, suggesting a possible increase in the moisture content of the air which could lead to a muggy feeling or the development of fog. Air pressure experienced a steady decline, which is often associated with the approach of a low-pressure system that could lead to changing weather conditions, such as increased cloudiness or precipitation. Wind speed saw a slight increase over the time frame, indicating that winds became moderately stronger as the day progressed. The wind direction was predominantly from the east to southeast, with a gradual shift towards the southeast later on, which in Houston can sometimes bring in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, affecting local weather patterns.
