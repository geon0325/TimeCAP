Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperature exhibited a typical diurnal pattern with a peak during the daytime and a gradual decrease overnight, reaching its lowest point just before sunrise. Humidity levels varied considerably, starting low, increasing significantly towards the end of the period, which suggests the potential for morning fog or dew, especially with the corresponding drop in temperatures. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable for much of the day but showed a significant decrease in the last few hours, which could indicate an approaching weather system with the possibility of changing weather conditions, such as increased cloudiness or precipitation. Wind speeds were mostly moderate but showed periods of increased intensity, particularly in the middle of the day, and the prevailing winds shifted from calm conditions to a more northerly direction towards the end of the period. The combination of increasing humidity, dropping pressure, and shifting wind patterns may suggest that San Francisco could experience more unsettled weather in the near term.
