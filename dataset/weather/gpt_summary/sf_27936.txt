Over the last 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have exhibited a slight fluctuation, with a trend towards cooling during the nighttime hours, which is typical for the coastal climate of the region. Humidity levels have remained relatively high throughout the period, peaking at night and early morning, potentially contributing to foggy conditions that are common in San Francisco. Air pressure has shown minor variations, but overall, it has stayed within a range that suggests stable weather conditions without the presence of any significant weather systems. Wind speeds have been moderate, with an increase during the day which could have helped to disperse any early fog or low clouds, leading to clearer conditions later on. The wind direction has been predominantly from the south to southwest, which is a common pattern for the city and may have contributed to the transport of moist oceanic air inland, maintaining higher humidity levels.
