Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with an initial downtrend followed by a recovery, closing higher at 4415.24 from an earlier low of 4224.16. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, has generally trended downwards, indicating increasing market stability, closing at 14.17 from a peak of 21.71. Meanwhile, international indices like the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have experienced fluctuations, with the Nikkei displaying a rebound in the latter part of the period and the FTSE 100 showing a decline on the last trading day to 7360.60. Commodity prices such as Gold Futures and Crude Oil Futures have seen a downward trend in prices, with Gold dipping to 1932.60 from a high of 1988.60 and Crude Oil dropping to 77.17 from 89.37, which could indicate a shift in investor sentiment towards risk or a response to broader economic indicators. Currency markets have been relatively stable with slight strengthening of the EUR/USD and a consistent increase in the USD/JPY exchange rate, the latter closing at 151.35, suggesting increased demand for the dollar or changes in monetary policy expectations.
