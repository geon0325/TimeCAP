The analysis of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data over the past 20 weeks indicates a decreasing trend in the ratio of ILI patients, with the recent weeks falling below the baseline ratio, suggesting a decline in ILI prevalence. The age group of 5-24 years initially showed a significant increase in ILI cases, which could be associated with school-age children and young adults being more susceptible to ILI, but this has since shown a steady decrease. Older age groups, particularly those aged 65 and above, have consistently reported the lowest number of ILI cases throughout the period, which might be reflective of higher vaccination rates or possibly better preventative measures within this demographic. Despite a reduction in the ratio of ILI patients overall, the healthcare system must remain vigilant, as ILI activity can fluctuate and resurge, necessitating continued monitoring and readiness to respond to potential increases in demand for healthcare services. The initial elevated ILI activity observed could have strained healthcare resources, but the current trend suggests a relative easing of such pressures.
