Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a gradual decline in temperature followed by a significant increase midway through the period, suggesting a possible frontal passage or change in air mass. Humidity levels peaked in the early hours, which, in conjunction with the higher temperatures observed later, could have contributed to a muggy and uncomfortable feel for residents. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, indicating no significant weather systems impacting the area. Wind speeds were generally light but did exhibit a brief increase, potentially resulting in short-term changes in perceived temperature due to wind chill. The wind direction varied significantly, ranging from northeast to southwest, which could correlate with the changing weather patterns observed in temperature and humidity.
