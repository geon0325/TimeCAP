Over the last 20 weeks, the data reveals a fluctuation in the number of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with an overall average positivity ratio of 6.26%, suggesting a moderate level of influenza activity. Notably, the ratio of positive specimens for Influenza A and B has varied, with Influenza B initially being more prevalent but decreasing over time, while Influenza A showed a slight increase. However, both strains peaked at different times, with Influenza A's highest positivity ratio reaching 1.35% in week 2, and Influenza B peaking at 3.12% in week 1. Despite a decrease in overall specimen positivity from a high of 4.39% in week 1 to a low of 0.76% in week 15, there has been a slight uptick in recent weeks, with the positivity rate hovering around 1.70%. This trend of fluctuating influenza activity could have implications for healthcare resource allocation, emphasizing the need for continued surveillance and possibly indicating the onset of a seasonal trend.
