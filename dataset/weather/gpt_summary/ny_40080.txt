Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual rise in temperature that peaked during the late afternoon before slowly decreasing towards the evening, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels showed an inverse relationship with temperature, starting higher in the early hours, decreasing significantly as temperatures climbed, and then rising again as the temperatures began to drop. Air pressure remained relatively stable with only minor fluctuations, suggesting a steady weather pattern without significant front movements. Wind speeds varied, with notable increases during the afternoon, which, along with rising temperatures, could have contributed to a decrease in relative humidity by dispersing moisture. The prevailing wind direction was generally southerly to southwesterly, shifting to westerly and then northwesterly by the end of the period, which could suggest the passage of a weather system moving through the area.
