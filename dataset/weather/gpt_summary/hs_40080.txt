Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have demonstrated a slight fluctuation with a general trend of cooling down slightly during the nighttime and warming up again towards the afternoon. Humidity levels experienced minor variations, maintaining a relatively high percentage throughout the period, which might have contributed to muggy conditions. Air pressure has been gradually decreasing, indicating the potential for changing weather patterns or the approach of a weather system. Wind speed showed some variability with periods of stronger gusts, particularly around the middle of the time series, which could have dispersed humidity and affected thermal comfort. The wind direction was predominantly from the south-southeast, which is typical for Houston and can bring in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, affecting both humidity and temperature levels.
