Over the past 24 hours in New York City, the temperature showed a gradual increase before plateauing and then slightly decreasing towards the end of the period. Humidity levels started high but saw a significant decrease through the middle of the time series, indicating drier air moving into the area, before rising again towards the end. Air pressure steadily increased for much of the period, suggesting the strengthening of a high-pressure system which typically brings stable weather conditions. Wind speeds varied, with some calm periods, but there were also instances of moderate breeze; wind direction shifted throughout the day, with no predominant direction sustained over time. Overall, the combination of rising pressure and variable winds with a period of lower humidity might have led to clearer skies and more comfortable conditions but ended in a slightly more humid environment as the day progressed.
