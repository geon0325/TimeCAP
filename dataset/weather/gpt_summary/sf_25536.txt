Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a moderate decrease in temperature, indicative of a transition from daytime warmth to cooler nighttime conditions. Relative humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with very high readings suggesting the presence of considerable moisture in the air, which could have led to foggy conditions, particularly when paired with lower temperatures. Air pressure showed some variability with a notable peak, which may have been associated with a transient high-pressure system passing through the area, potentially bringing clearer skies during its presence. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with some stronger gusts occurring, which could have influenced cooler temperatures felt on the ground due to wind chill effects. The wind direction varied widely throughout the day, suggesting a changeable and possibly unsettled weather pattern over the city.
