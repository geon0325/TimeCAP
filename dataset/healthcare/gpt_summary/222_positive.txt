Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable decline in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the ratio of positive specimens dropping significantly from a peak of 30.26% in week 5 to a low of 0.21% by week 20. The decline is observed in both Influenza A and B, with Influenza A positivity dropping from a high of 19.31% to 0.11% and Influenza B from 13.39% to 0.11% within the same period. The initial weeks showed a heightened prevalence of positive specimens, which could have placed a strain on healthcare resources due to increased patient load and the need for diagnostic testing. The recent low percentages indicate a subsiding influenza activity, potentially reducing the pressure on healthcare services related to influenza. However, the healthcare system must remain vigilant for possible future upticks in influenza positivity rates and continue to promote vaccination and preventive measures.
