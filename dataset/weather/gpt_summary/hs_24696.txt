Over the last 24 hours in Houston, temperature trends exhibited a typical diurnal cycle with a gradual increase during the daylight hours, peaking in the late afternoon, before decreasing through the night into the early morning. Relative humidity levels were inversely correlated with temperature, as is common, with the highest humidity occurring during the cooler early morning hours and the lowest during the peak afternoon heat. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, indicating a lack of significant weather systems moving through the area. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate and predominantly from the south, which is typical for Houston and may contribute to the transport of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, affecting humidity levels. A notable shift in wind direction to westerly in the late afternoon could indicate the passage of a frontal boundary or localized weather phenomena affecting wind patterns.
