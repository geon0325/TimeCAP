Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, indicating a cooling trend. Humidity levels have varied significantly, with a sharp decrease in the early hours, but elevated levels during and after the temperature decline, suggesting the presence of moisture in the air. Air pressure has been steadily increasing, which is often associated with the approach of more stable weather conditions. Wind speeds have been mostly light to moderate, with some periods of higher gusts, while wind direction has shifted across various points of the compass, indicating changing weather patterns. The combination of decreasing temperature, high humidity, increasing pressure, and variable winds could point towards a likelihood of cooler and potentially damp weather conditions in the near future.
