Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have shown a cyclical pattern with a gentle rise during the daytime and a fall through the night, typical of the coastal climate. The relative humidity has been remarkably high, reaching saturation at several points, which is indicative of foggy conditions or the presence of marine layer that is common in the area. Atmospheric pressure has remained relatively stable, with only slight fluctuations, suggesting steady weather conditions without the immediate approach of significant weather fronts. Wind speeds have been consistently light, which is typical for the region and does not suggest any immediate concerns for wind-related impacts. Wind direction has varied but stayed predominantly in the west to southwest range, which is consistent with the prevailing winds coming off the Pacific Ocean and impacting the local climate.
