Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have shown minor fluctuations within a narrow range, maintaining generally warm conditions throughout the day and night. Humidity levels have remained high, consistently sitting near saturation, which could lead to a muggy feeling and the potential for fog or low clouds, especially during the early morning or late evening hours. Atmospheric pressure has stayed relatively stable, indicating a period of steady weather without significant changes or the immediate development of strong weather systems. Wind speeds have been light to gentle, and while varying slightly, have increased marginally, suggesting a subtle shift in weather patterns. The wind direction has gradually shifted from the southeast to the south-southwest, which is typical for this region and may contribute to the influx of moist air from the Gulf of Mexico, reinforcing the existing humid conditions.
