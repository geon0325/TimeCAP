Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a moderate fluctuation in temperatures, with a warming trend noted towards the latter part of the period. Humidity levels remained relatively high throughout the day, suggesting a presence of moisture in the air that could potentially lead to fog or low clouds, particularly during the cooler, early morning hours when humidity peaked. Air pressure remained fairly stable, indicating a likelihood of continued similar weather conditions without the immediate approach of a significant weather system. Wind speeds varied, with some calm periods, especially around midday, but there were also instances of moderate breeze; such variability in wind could lead to sporadic changes in local weather conditions, including temperature and cloud cover. Predominant wind directions were westerly, which is typical for San Francisco, bringing in cool air from the Pacific Ocean that can moderate temperatures and contribute to the area's characteristic microclimates.
