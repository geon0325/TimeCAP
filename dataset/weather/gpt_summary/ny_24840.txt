Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak during the later afternoon hours before slowly declining. Concurrently, relative humidity levels showed a significant decrease throughout the day, inversely related to the temperature rise, suggesting a typical diurnal pattern. Atmospheric pressure has been on a slight downward trend, which could indicate an approaching weather system. Wind speeds have varied but showed an increase towards the end of the period, with gustier conditions in the evening, while wind direction has been predominantly westerly to southwesterly, with some variability. These conditions, particularly the falling pressure and increased wind speeds, may be precursors to changing weather, potentially bringing more dynamic conditions in the following days.
