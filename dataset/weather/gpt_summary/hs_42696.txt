Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has fluctuated within a moderately high range, suggesting warm conditions that peaked during the afternoon hours. Simultaneously, relative humidity levels have shown variability, with a general trend of higher humidity in the early morning and late evening, which is typical for the region and might have contributed to muggy conditions. Air pressure experienced a significant spike but then stabilized and showed a slight declining trend, which could be indicative of a transient weather system passing through the area. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate throughout the period, with occasional increase in intensity, which could have offered some relief from the heat. The prevailing wind direction has been primarily from the south to southeast, which is consistent with warm air being drawn in from the Gulf of Mexico, possibly contributing to the higher humidity and temperatures observed.
