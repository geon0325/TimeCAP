Humidity levels varied significantly, starting moderate, increasing to saturation at one point, and then dropping to lower levels in the mid-afternoon, suggesting the presence of moisture and possible early morning fog, followed by drier conditions later on. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with only slight fluctuations, indicating steady weather patterns without the immediate approach of any significant weather fronts. Wind speeds were generally light, with occasional moderate gusts, and the wind direction showed variability, shifting from predominantly southerly to a northerly direction and back to southerly, before ending with more westerly winds, possibly bringing changes in weather conditions.
