Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature experienced a moderate fluctuation, with a noticeable increase during the afternoon hours, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels varied significantly, reaching saturation at one point, which may have led to fog or mist formation, especially during the cooler early morning hours when the temperature was at its lowest. Air pressure showed a slight decreasing trend over the period, suggesting the possibility of changing weather patterns, such as the approach of a weather front. Wind speed demonstrated variability with moments of calm and a peak suggesting a breezy condition that could influence wind chill and dispersion of any airborne particulates. The prevailing wind direction was primarily from the south to southeast, which is typical for Houston and can be associated with warm, moist air coming from the Gulf of Mexico, potentially affecting local humidity levels.
