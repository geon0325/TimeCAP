Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have exhibited a gradual upward trend, indicating a warming pattern that could lead to higher than average daytime temperatures. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with periods of complete saturation suggesting the possibility of fog or dew, especially during early morning hours when temperatures were lower. Air pressure experienced a slight but steady decline through the period, which could be indicative of an approaching weather system that may affect local conditions. Wind speeds varied moderately, with a noticeable increase towards the end of the period, potentially heralding a change in weather patterns or the onset of a front. The wind direction remained predominantly from the south to southeast, which in Houston typically brings in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, possibly contributing to the observed high humidity and supporting the development of cloud cover or precipitation.
