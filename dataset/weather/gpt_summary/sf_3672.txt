Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a mild and stable range in temperature, indicative of typical weather conditions without any extreme fluctuations. Humidity levels have remained relatively high throughout the day, suggesting a presence of moisture in the air that could lead to foggy conditions, particularly in the morning or late evening hours. Atmospheric pressure has been consistent, which is usually associated with steady weather patterns and a lower likelihood of significant weather disturbances. Wind speeds have been moderate with some variability, but no extreme gusts were reported, which should not cause any major disruptions to outdoor activities. The wind direction has been predominantly from the west with a few shifts, which is common for coastal cities like San Francisco and may contribute to the transport of marine air inland.
