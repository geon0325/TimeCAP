Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have shown a general warming trend with some minor fluctuations, peaking in the late afternoon. Humidity levels have been variable, starting at moderate levels, increasing to saturation during the night and early morning hours, and then decreasing again towards the evening, indicative of potential early morning fog or dew. Air pressure has seen a slight but steady decline throughout the period, suggesting a possible change in weather patterns or the approach of a weather front. Wind speeds have been mostly light to moderate, with a significant increase towards the end of the period, while the wind direction has been predominantly from the south, shifting occasionally to other directions, which could influence local temperature and moisture levels. These conditions, particularly the combination of high temperatures and varying humidity, are typical for Houston's climate and could result in afternoon heat discomfort and potential for overnight and early morning mist or fog.
