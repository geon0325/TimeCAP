Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature, starting off relatively stable, then experiencing a dip before rising significantly and finally stabilizing at a slightly lower value. Humidity levels were variable, reaching saturation during the cooler early hours but significantly decreasing as temperatures rose, indicating the presence of moisture-laden air that could have contributed to fog or low clouds, especially when humidity hit its peak. Air pressure remained largely stable throughout the day, which suggests that no significant weather systems were moving through the area that would drastically change the weather patterns. Wind speeds were mostly light with a slight increase towards the end of the period, which may have helped to disperse some of the humidity or fog in localized areas. The wind direction was variable but predominantly from the west-northwest, which is typical for coastal San Francisco and could have contributed to the movement of oceanic air masses towards inland areas.
