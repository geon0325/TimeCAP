Over the past 24 hours in New York City, temperatures have exhibited a gradual upward trend from the early hours, reaching a peak in the late afternoon before starting to cool down again. Humidity levels started relatively high and saw a noticeable decrease through the afternoon, which typically suggests an increased comfort level outdoors. Air pressure remained relatively stable, indicating no major weather fronts moving in, which typically means stable weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate throughout the day, with some increase later on, but not enough to cause significant wind-related impacts. The wind direction varied significantly, with notable shifts from southerly to westerly and then to northerly before settling on a southeasterly direction, which could influence local temperature distribution and air quality.
