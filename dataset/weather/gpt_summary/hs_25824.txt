Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have experienced a diurnal cycle with a noticeable increase during the daytime, followed by a gradual decline at night. Humidity levels have shown variability, with a significant drop in the afternoon which could indicate the passage of a dry air mass, before rising again in the evening. Air pressure has remained relatively stable, with a slight increase towards the latter part of the day, suggesting stable weather conditions may be prevailing. Wind speeds have been mostly light to moderate, with an increase observed in the afternoon hours, which could contribute to the lower humidity levels observed during the same period. The predominant wind direction has been from the east to southeast, shifting towards the south and then southeast, which is typical for Houston's weather patterns and may influence moisture transport from the Gulf of Mexico.
