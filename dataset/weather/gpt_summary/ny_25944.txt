Over the past 24 hours in New York City, temperatures exhibited a gradual increase during the day, reaching a peak in the late afternoon before cooling down slightly towards the evening. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with notably high humidity occurring during the early morning hours, potentially leading to foggy conditions, then decreasing substantially as temperatures rose, which is typical of diurnal patterns. Air pressure remained relatively stable but showed a slight decreasing trend, which could suggest the approach of a weather system that might cause changes in the weather. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate with some increase later in the period, which could contribute to a feeling of cooler temperatures especially when coupled with higher wind speeds. Wind direction varied throughout the day, with a notable shift from predominantly southerly to a more easterly direction by the evening, which could influence the transport of air masses and thus affect local weather conditions.
