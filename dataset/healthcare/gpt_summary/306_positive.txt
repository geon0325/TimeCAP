Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant increase in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the ratio of positive specimens rising from 0.07% to 4.21%, peaking at 6.23% in the 18th week. The data shows a more pronounced prevalence of Influenza A, which accounts for the majority of positive cases, spiking from a mere 0.04% to a high of 6.17% in the 18th week, before dropping to 4.14% in the final week. In contrast, Influenza B has remained a smaller proportion of the positive specimens, with a slight increase from 0.03% to 0.07% over the 20 weeks. The peak in positive test rates corresponds with a dramatic rise in the number of specimens tested, suggesting an outbreak with increased transmission and leading to heightened testing demand. Given these trends, healthcare systems may face increased strain due to rising influenza cases, necessitating resource allocation for testing, vaccination, and treatment to manage the uptick in infections.
