Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has demonstrated significant volatility with a notable downward trend, declining from 3373.94 to 2480.64, reflecting growing investor concerns about the market's stability. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, mirrored this sentiment with a sharp increase from 14.15 to 75.47, indicating heightened market stress. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 also experienced substantial drops, suggesting a global market retreat, with the Nikkei 225 falling from 23827.73 to 18559.63 and the FTSE 100 plunging from 7452.00 to 5237.50. Safe-haven assets like Gold Futures initially saw an uptick, peaking at 1674.50, before retreating to 1589.30, while Crude Oil Futures plummeted from 51.42 to 31.50, possibly due to both demand shock and oversupply concerns. Currency markets showed the Euro and Japanese Yen strengthening against the US Dollar, with EUR/USD rising from 1.09 to 1.13 and USD/JPY falling from 109.85 to 104.55, which could indicate a flight to perceived safety in these currencies.
