Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a notable increase in temperature, indicating a warming trend that could lead to higher than average temperatures for the area. Humidity levels were extremely high, reaching saturation during the early hours, which suggests a possibility of fog or dew formation and may contribute to a muggy feeling in the air. Air pressure has been gradually decreasing, which is often associated with an approaching weather system that could result in changing weather conditions. Wind speeds remained relatively light to moderate, with some variability in direction, suggesting a lack of a strong weather front influencing the area. The combination of high humidity, increasing temperatures, and decreasing air pressure could signal the potential for thunderstorm development, especially if a triggering mechanism such as a cold front were to arrive.
