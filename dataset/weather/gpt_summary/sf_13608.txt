Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperature has exhibited a typical diurnal pattern, starting off warmer in the earlier hours, cooling through the night, and warming again towards the end of the period. Humidity levels have fluctuated significantly, with higher humidity occurring concurrently with the cooler temperatures during the night and early morning hours, which is common as cooler air holds less moisture. Air pressure has remained relatively stable, indicating a period of steady weather without significant fronts or systems moving through the area. Wind speed has seen some variability, increasing significantly towards the end of the 24-hour period, potentially leading to windier conditions that could affect outdoor activities and marine interests. The wind has been predominantly coming from the west to the northwest, which is typical for San Francisco due to its coastal location and the influence of the Pacific Ocean.
