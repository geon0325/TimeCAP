Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia as a percentage of total deaths has mostly remained below the 20-week average of 7.84%, with the ratio fluctuating between 5.36% and 6.19%. This indicates a lower impact from these illnesses compared to the average, which could signify effective control measures, seasonal variations, or other health interventions at play. Despite the lower percentage, the actual number of deaths from pneumonia remains significant, ranging from 2689 to 3208 weekly, suggesting pneumonia continues to be a considerable health concern. The number of deaths from influenza has been relatively low, with a notable peak of 19 deaths in weeks 13, 18, and 19, but overall not significantly contributing to the total mortality. Healthcare systems may be experiencing less strain from these respiratory conditions currently, but continuous monitoring and preparedness for potential future outbreaks remain critical.
