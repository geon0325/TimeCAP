Over the past 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a general upward trend, closing higher by approximately 5.5% from 3390.68 to 3577.59, which indicates a growing investor confidence in the equities market. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, has decreased from 33.35 to 22.66, suggesting a reduction in investor fear and market uncertainty. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have also experienced upward movements, with the Nikkei 225 increasing notably by about 8.8%, which may reflect investor optimism in global economic recovery.

Gold Futures have seen volatility with a downward trend, dropping from 1908.80 to 1837.80, possibly indicating a shift in investor preference towards riskier assets as market conditions improve. Meanwhile, Crude Oil Futures have increased from 39.57 to 43.06, and the strengthening of the USD against major currencies like the JPY and CNY, but not against the EUR, could suggest a mixed view on the USD as investors balance domestic economic data with global trade expectations.
