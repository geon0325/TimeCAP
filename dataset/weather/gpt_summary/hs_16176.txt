Over the last 24 hours, the weather in Houston has exhibited a warming trend with temperatures peaking in the late afternoon, which is typical for the region's climate. Humidity levels have seen a fluctuation, starting moderate, increasing to very high during the early morning hours, and then gradually decreasing, suggesting the presence of moisture that could have led to morning fog or dew. Air pressure experienced a significant increase in the morning, indicating the possible passage of a high-pressure system, which generally brings stable weather conditions, but later in the day, the pressure showed a sharp decline that might signal an approaching weather system or front. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate throughout the day, with an increase towards the end of the period, which could enhance the feeling of lower temperatures and possibly contribute to the dispersion of humidity. The predominant wind direction was southerly to southeasterly, which in Houston is often associated with warm air being drawn from the Gulf of Mexico, potentially contributing to higher humidity levels experienced earlier in the day.
