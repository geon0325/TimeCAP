Over the last 20 weeks, the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia to the total number of deaths has demonstrated variability, with an average of 7.84% but with considerable weekly fluctuations ranging from a low of 5.20% to a high of 19.37% in the most recent week. The total number of deaths peaked in the last week at 86,888, a significant increase from the average of previous weeks, while the number of deaths attributed to influenza or pneumonia also spiked notably in the same period, particularly for pneumonia (16,800), suggesting a potential outbreak or a reporting anomaly. Despite fluctuations, the general trend for mortality specifically from influenza has shown an increase over the period, culminating in a sharp rise in the last four weeks. In contrast, pneumonia deaths, after a mid-period dip, have risen again, contributing to the increased overall mortality ratio. This trend warrants close monitoring and may necessitate a public health response to manage healthcare resources effectively and prevent further escalation.
