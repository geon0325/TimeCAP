Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has seen minimal fluctuation, maintaining a relatively stable range indicating a steady weather pattern without significant warm-ups or cool-downs. The humidity levels have increased significantly, reaching saturation towards the latter part of the observed period, which could suggest the potential for fog formation or precipitation. Air pressure has been high but showed a very gradual upward trend, possibly contributing to the stable temperature and increasing the likelihood of continued fair weather conditions. Wind speeds remained light to gentle throughout the period, with a slight increase in the middle of the timeframe, which is not expected to have a major impact on the current weather stability. However, the wind direction has varied, suggesting some changes in the local wind patterns, but without a strong prevailing direction that could indicate a significant weather system affecting the area.
