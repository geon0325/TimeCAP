Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature with a general tendency to increase, suggesting a gradual warming trend. Humidity levels varied, reaching their peak during the cooler early morning hours, which is typical due to the lower temperatures enhancing moisture retention in the air. The air pressure showed a consistent decrease throughout the period, indicating a potential for unstable weather conditions or the approach of a weather system that could lead to precipitation or storms. Wind speeds were moderate and primarily constant, with a few hours of calm winds, but no significant gusts or lulls were observed that would suggest dramatic weather changes. The wind direction was predominantly from the south to the southwest, with occasional shifts towards the west, which is consistent with warm air being drawn up from the Gulf, potentially contributing to the slight temperature increase and maintaining higher humidity levels.
