Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a slight decrease in temperature, indicating a mild cooling trend. Humidity levels started high but showed a significant decrease as the hours passed, which could lead to a feeling of dryness and potential comfort for residents compared to the earlier damp conditions. Air pressure has been steadily rising, suggesting stable and clearer weather conditions might be settling in. Wind speeds have generally increased throughout the period, reaching a peak before slightly declining, which could have contributed to the dispersal of any cloud cover and reduction in humidity. The wind has primarily been blowing from the south shifting towards the northwest, which is typically associated with the movement of weather fronts and could explain the changes in temperature and pressure observed.
