Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a notable diurnal temperature variation, with temperatures peaking during the afternoon hours and reaching their lowest in the early morning. Humidity levels have shown an inverse pattern to temperature, with very high humidity occurring during the cooler morning hours, suggesting the presence of morning fog or dew, which is typical for this coastal city. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with a slight decrease towards the end of the 24-hour window, which could indicate an approaching weather system or frontal boundary. Wind speeds have been light and variable, with a period of calm conditions during the night, which could have contributed to the formation of fog or low clouds. The wind direction varied significantly, with notable shifts from westerly in the early part of the day to easterly and then northerly by the end, reflecting the influence of local topography and land-sea interactions on the wind patterns in the San Francisco Bay Area.
