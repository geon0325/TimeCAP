Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced consistently high temperatures, remaining unchanged throughout the day and night, which may suggest an unusual weather pattern or a data anomaly. The humidity level has also remained constant, indicating a stable but dry air mass over the city, which could increase the risk of wildfires in the surrounding areas. Air pressure has not fluctuated, suggesting a stable atmospheric condition without the presence of significant weather fronts moving through the area. Wind speeds have been steady, with no variation, which might contribute to a perceived increase in temperature due to a lack of cooling breezes. The wind direction has been fixed, showing a persistent flow from the same direction which could have implications for local air quality, depending on the origin of the air mass.
