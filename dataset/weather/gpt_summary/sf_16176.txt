Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a noticeable decrease in temperature during the night, followed by a gradual increase throughout the day, consistent with diurnal patterns. Humidity levels were relatively moderate but peaked to saturation during the early morning hours, which may have led to foggy conditions typical of the city's microclimate. Air pressure remained fairly stable but showed a sudden spike coinciding with the peak humidity, suggesting the possible influence of a transient weather front. Wind speeds were generally light and variable, with a couple of brief periods of higher speeds that could have contributed to a wind chill effect during the cooler hours. The dominant wind direction shifted throughout the day, with a notable variation from westerly to northerly and then easterly directions, which could impact coastal fog dispersion and local temperature distribution.
