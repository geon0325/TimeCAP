Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable increase in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the proportion of positive tests rising from 0.97% in the first week to 18.34% in the last week. The total number of specimens tested has also increased, peaking at 157,775 in the final week, suggesting an escalated level of surveillance and testing. Influenza A has been the predominant strain, with its positivity rate increasing significantly from 0.93% to 18.22%, indicating a widespread outbreak that could strain healthcare resources. The positivity rate for Influenza B remained relatively low and stable, increasing marginally from 0.05% to 0.12%. The steep upward trend in the positivity rates, particularly for Influenza A, indicates an urgent need for healthcare systems to prepare for higher patient volumes and potential increases in hospitalizations and resource allocation.
