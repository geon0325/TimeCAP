Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have shown a moderate fluctuation, with a general increase during the daytime hours followed by a slight decrease towards the latter part of the period. Humidity levels started relatively high but have seen a significant decrease, suggesting drier air moving into the area. Air pressure has remained remarkably steady, indicating stable atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds have been mild but experienced a gradual increase throughout the period, while wind direction has been variable with both northerly and southerly components at different times. This combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, steady pressure, and increasing wind speeds may suggest a transition to clearer and more stable weather conditions for the short term.
