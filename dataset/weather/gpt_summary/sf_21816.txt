Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have shown a typical diurnal pattern with a peak during the day followed by a gradual decrease through the night into the early morning. Humidity levels were generally high, increasing overnight which is indicative of stable atmospheric conditions and possibly the presence of marine layers which are common in the region. Air pressure remained relatively constant, suggesting a stable weather pattern without significant fronts or storm systems affecting the area. Wind speeds were light and mostly consistent, with only slight increases observed, which would not have had a major impact on local weather conditions. The wind direction was predominantly from the west-southwest, which is characteristic of the maritime influence on San Francisco's climate.
