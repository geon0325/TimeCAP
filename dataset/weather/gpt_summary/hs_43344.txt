Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a notable fluctuation in temperature, with a general increase during the daytime and a decrease at night, which is typical of the diurnal cycle. Humidity levels experienced significant variations, reaching peak values during the early morning hours, indicative of possible morning fog or dew, then dropped considerably as temperatures rose. Air pressure showed a gradual decreasing trend throughout the period, suggesting that the area might be experiencing an approach of a low-pressure system, which could lead to weather instability or precipitation. Wind speeds were mostly light but picked up during the afternoon, which, coupled with the lowering pressure, could enhance the chances of dynamic weather conditions. The wind direction was variable, although predominantly from the north and northeast, which may have contributed to the cooler temperatures observed in the early hours and the transport of moisture, affecting the local humidity levels.
