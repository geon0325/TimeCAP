Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a steady increase in the number of specimens tested for influenza, with a significant rise from 6,258 in week 1 to 34,907 in week 20. Despite the growing number of tests, the percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza has remained relatively stable, averaging 6.26%, with a minor fluctuation between 0.13% and 0.40% weekly. Influenza A detections have been consistent, with a slight decrease in the positive ratio from 0.18% in week 3 to 0.09% in week 20, whereas Influenza B showed a notable increase in the positive ratio from 0.08% in week 1 to 0.13% in week 20, peaking at 0.22% in week 12. The ratio of positive specimens for Influenza B surpassed those for Influenza A starting from week 12, indicating a shift in the predominant strain. This data suggests a potential shift in the healthcare system's focus towards addressing Influenza B, and the consistent rate of positive tests emphasizes the need for sustained influenza surveillance and vaccination efforts.
