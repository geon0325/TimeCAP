Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature followed by a sharp decline, suggesting the passage of a weather front. Humidity levels were significantly high for the majority of the period but decreased drastically towards the end, indicating a change in air masses affecting the area. Air pressure showed a steady decrease throughout most of the day, reaching a trough before slightly recovering, which could be associated with the approach and passage of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased substantially in the latter part of the period, with the highest speeds towards the end, implying that windy conditions have developed or are developing. The wind direction shifted from easterly to westerly, complementing the observation of a passing weather system that has likely brought changes in temperature and humidity.
