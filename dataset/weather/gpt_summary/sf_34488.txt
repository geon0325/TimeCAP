Over the last 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a noticeable drop in temperature followed by a slight recovery, suggesting a cooling trend that transitioned into a modest warming. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with periods of very high humidity, which could have contributed to varying degrees of fog or mist especially during the cooler hours. Air pressure experienced some variability with a notable dip and subsequent rise, indicating the passage of a weather system through the area. Wind speeds remained generally low but picked up considerably towards the end of the period, which may have helped to clear out any lingering moisture or fog. The wind direction varied widely, starting with a northerly direction, shifting to predominantly westerly and then finishing with stronger northwesterly winds, which is typical for the coastal climate of San Francisco and can influence marine conditions and coastal temperatures.
