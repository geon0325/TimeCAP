Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, peaking during the late afternoon hours, indicative of typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels were highest during the early morning, coinciding with cooler temperatures, but decreased significantly as temperatures rose, suggesting the presence of drier air moving into the area. Air pressure showed a slight decreasing trend throughout the day, which could be associated with a subtle shift in weather patterns, possibly leading to increased cloudiness or the potential for precipitation. Wind speeds varied moderately, with a noticeable increase around the middle of the day, which could have contributed to the dispersal of morning humidity and the introduction of the drier conditions that followed. The wind direction was predominantly southerly to southeasterly but shifted more towards the south-southwest during the times of peak temperatures, which is consistent with the typical circulation patterns that can influence local weather conditions in Houston.
