Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature from its peak during the day to a cooler night, followed by a moderate rise as the new day progressed. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, starting low, increasing dramatically towards the morning hours, and then decreasing, likely impacting the comfort levels throughout the city. Air pressure remained relatively stable with only minor variations, but a notable drop was observed in the early hours, which could suggest a transient weather system moving through the area. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a period of calm conditions around midday, potentially leading to a build-up of urban pollution without the cleansing effect of stronger breezes. Wind direction varied significantly, with a clear shift from westerly winds to a brief period of calm, followed by gentle breezes from varying directions, concluding with a return to westerly winds by the end of the period.
