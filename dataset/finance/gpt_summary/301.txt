Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has exhibited significant volatility, initially dropping sharply then recovering to end the period at 2789.82, suggesting a rebound amidst ongoing market turbulence. The VIX, or Volatility Index, has gradually decreased from a high of 82.69 to 41.67, indicating a reduction in market fear and investor sentiment stabilizing. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 also showed recovery patterns, ending the period higher than their lows, which points to a global market correction after initial panic. Commodity prices saw gold futures rise, reflecting a flight to safety, with gold reaching 1736.20, whereas crude oil futures declined to 22.76, highlighting the energy sector's stress due to oversupply and weak demand. Finally, the foreign exchange rates remained relatively stable, with minor fluctuations in the EUR/USD and USD/JPY pairs, and a slight weakening of the USD against the CNY, suggesting currency markets are less volatile compared to equity and commodities markets.
