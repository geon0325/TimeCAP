Over the last 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual rise in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before gradually cooling down. Humidity levels showcased significant variability, with a notable spike to saturation followed by a decrease, indicating potential early morning fog that later cleared. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively steady, with a slight decreasing trend, suggesting stable weather conditions but with a possibility of minor changes ahead. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a period of calm winds around midday and an increase towards the evening, which could contribute to a cooler night-time feel. The wind direction shifted throughout the day, with a predominant flow from the south to south-east, briefly turning northerly, and then settling from the south again, which may have influenced the temperature variability and humidity levels experienced.
