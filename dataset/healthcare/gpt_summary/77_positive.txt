Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a general decline in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the ratio of positive specimens decreasing from 18.48% to 1.90%. Influenza A showed a significant drop in positivity from 7.22% to 1.10%, while Influenza B decreased more steeply from 11.26% to 0.80%. The highest number of specimens tested occurred in the first week (32,481), and the lowest in the last week (6,893), suggesting a decrease in testing frequency or need over the period. The reduction in positive cases is indicative of a waning influenza season, which could lead to a lower burden on the healthcare system. However, continuous monitoring is essential to detect any potential resurgence and to ensure that resources are allocated appropriately for influenza management and prevention.
