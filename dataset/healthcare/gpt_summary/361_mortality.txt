Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality rates from Influenza or Pneumonia as a proportion of total deaths have generally trended downwards, starting above the average ratio at 8.97% and ending below it at 5.93%. The total number of deaths peaked in week 4 at 70,168 before steadily declining to 40,849 by week 20, while deaths specifically from Influenza and Pneumonia followed a similar declining trend. Despite fluctuations, the combined deaths from these illnesses decreased from a high of 6,007 in week 1 to a low of 2,424 in week 20. The ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to total deaths also saw a downward trend, suggesting either an improvement in the management and treatment of these conditions or a seasonal decline in their prevalence. This decrease in the mortality ratio below the average of 7.84% could potentially indicate a reduced burden on healthcare resources specific to these diseases.
