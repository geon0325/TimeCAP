Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before stabilizing. Humidity levels showed a significant decrease throughout the day, particularly in the latter hours, which is typical as temperatures rise. Air pressure fluctuated but had notable peaks that suggest the presence of transient high-pressure systems moving through the area. Wind speeds remained mostly light and variable, with a slightly more brisk period towards the evening. Wind direction was predominantly from the northeast in the early hours, shifting to a more southerly direction mid-day, and then returning to northerly in the later hours, indicating the passage of a frontal system through Houston.
