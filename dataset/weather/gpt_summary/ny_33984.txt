Over the last 24 hours in New York City, there was a subtle downward trend in temperature followed by a gradual rise, indicative of typical diurnal variation with no extreme changes. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, showing a notable increase during the cooler early morning hours, which is a common occurrence as cooler air holds less moisture. Air pressure experienced a slight but steady decrease throughout the period, suggesting a possible gradual approach of a weather system that could lead to changing weather patterns. Wind speeds remained light and variable, with a period of calm conditions, which may have contributed to a more stable local weather situation without significant wind chill or dispersion of urban pollutants. The wind direction shifted from predominantly northwesterly to a brief southerly direction before settling into a southeasterly pattern, possibly influencing any maritime air masses and associated weather conditions moving into the area.
