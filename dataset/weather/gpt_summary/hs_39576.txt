Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual decrease in temperature from the day into the night, followed by a warming trend that peaked in the late afternoon. The humidity levels showed an inverse relationship with temperature, where higher temperatures corresponded with lower humidity and vice versa, indicating possible discomfort during the cooler, more humid periods. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the period, which could suggest an increased likelihood of changing weather patterns or incoming systems. Wind speeds varied, with calmer conditions during the night and early morning, and more brisk winds in the late afternoon, which could influence the dispersion of any present atmospheric particulates. The predominant wind direction was southerly to southwesterly, which in Houston, often contributes to warmer, moist air being drawn in from the Gulf of Mexico.
