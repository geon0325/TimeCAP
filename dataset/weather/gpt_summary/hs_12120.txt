Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a mild decrease in temperature during the early morning hours, which then increased gradually as the day progressed, indicating a typical diurnal pattern. Humidity levels started high and saw a significant drop in the afternoon, likely leading to more comfortable conditions for residents. Air pressure experienced a steady decline throughout the period, which could suggest an approaching weather system with the potential for changing weather conditions. Wind speeds varied but increased towards the end of the period, with wind direction largely from the south, which is common in Houston and can contribute to bringing in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. Overall, the combination of these weather indicators points towards a typical Houston weather pattern, with the decreasing pressure being the most notable feature that could indicate potential weather changes ahead.
