Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a general upward trend, increasing from 4306.26 to 4575.52, indicative of growing investor confidence or a positive market response to underlying economic factors. In contrast, the VIX, which measures market volatility, has decreased from 33.32 to 19.63, suggesting a decline in market uncertainty and investor fear. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have also exhibited an upward movement, with the Nikkei recovering from a dip to 24717.53 and the FTSE climbing despite a slight drop in the latest session. Gold futures have experienced some volatility but trended downwards from 1942.40 to 1939.60, which could signal a shift in investor preference towards riskier assets as market conditions stabilize. The exchange rates for EUR/USD and USD/JPY have remained relatively stable, with the USD strengthening against the JPY, while crude oil futures have seen significant fluctuations, ending at 105.96 from a high of 123.70, possibly reflecting market reactions to geopolitical tensions and supply considerations.
