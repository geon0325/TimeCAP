Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, followed by a notable increase during the afternoon hours, which is typical due to diurnal heating. Humidity levels were consistently high throughout the early hours, indicating a very moist atmosphere, but there was a marked drop during peak daytime temperatures suggesting some degree of atmospheric mixing. Air pressure showed a slight declining trend, which could be indicative of a developing low-pressure system that may affect local weather patterns. Wind speeds remained relatively light, with a slight increase observed later in the period, which could contribute to modest wind chill effects during cooler hours. The wind direction was predominantly from the southeast, shifting more southerly later on, which is common for Houston, often bringing moisture from the Gulf of Mexico into the area.
