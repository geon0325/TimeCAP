Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature experienced a noticeable fluctuation, exhibiting a general downward trend during the early hours followed by a significant increase through the afternoon and stabilizing at slightly elevated levels towards the end of the period. Humidity levels were variable, with a peak during the nighttime that coincided with lower temperatures, suggesting possible early morning fog or dew, and a decrease in humidity as temperatures rose, typical of diurnal patterns. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight decrease observed, which could indicate the approach or presence of a weather system. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, increasing as the day progressed, which might have contributed to the dispersal of any early moisture and a more comfortable perceived temperature. The wind direction varied, primarily coming from the south to southeast, which is often associated with warmer and more humid conditions in Houston.
