Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature experienced a notable diurnal variation, with a significant increase during daylight hours followed by a decrease at night, which is typical for this region. Humidity levels showed an inverse correlation with temperature, peaking during the cooler early morning hours and then decreasing as temperatures rose, indicating a pattern of higher moisture levels at cooler temperatures. Air pressure remained relatively stable initially but showed a significant increase towards the end of the 24-hour period, suggesting a potential change in weather patterns, such as the possible approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds varied modestly, with a slight increase towards the afternoon that could have contributed to a dispersal of humidity. The wind direction was predominantly from the southern quadrant, which is consistent with the region's prevailing winds and may have influenced the transport of moisture and heat in the area.
