Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, peaking in the late afternoon before starting to decrease slightly. Humidity levels started relatively high but saw a significant fluctuation, with a notable increase in the early morning hours, indicative of potential early morning fog or mist, followed by a decrease as the temperature rose, which is typical of a diurnal pattern. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with only minor variations, suggesting a period of stable weather conditions without the immediate threat of significant weather systems moving in. Wind speeds varied mildly, with a few periods of lighter winds, especially during the night and early morning, and some increases during the day, which could have contributed to a more comfortable perceived temperature despite the warmth. Wind direction showed a shift from primarily southerly to more westerly and northerly later in the day, which can often be associated with the passage of a weather front and potential changes in weather patterns.
