Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have experienced a slight fluctuation, indicative of a typical diurnal cycle with a subtle cooling trend toward the early morning hours before warming up again. Humidity levels showed a significant rise during the night, reaching saturation, which suggests the possibility of fog or dew formation, but then decreased substantially during the day, pointing towards drier conditions. Air pressure has seen a gradual increase throughout the period, signaling the likely influence of a high-pressure system moving into the area, which is often associated with stable weather conditions. Wind speeds varied, with calmer periods interspersed with occasional gusty conditions, and wind directions shifted markedly, indicating the presence of varying air masses influencing the local weather. The combined data suggest a dynamic atmosphere with changing conditions that may affect local weather patterns including temperature, humidity, and wind-related events.
