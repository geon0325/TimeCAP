Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the later hours, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels have seen significant fluctuations, with the highest levels occurring during the early morning hours, which is common due to nighttime cooling leading to condensation. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout much of the day, with a notable drop occurring in the evening, which could be associated with the development of transient weather systems or frontal movements in the area. Wind speeds increased from calm to moderate as the day progressed, with the highest speeds observed during the afternoon, which could influence wave heights and local sea conditions if sustained. The wind direction has been predominantly from the south to southeast, which is typical for this region and may bring increased moisture, potentially contributing to cloud formation and the chance of precipitation.
