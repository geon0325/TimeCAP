Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a notable fluctuation in temperature, with a general increase during the daytime and a cooler trend overnight. Humidity levels have shown a decreasing trend, particularly during the warmer hours, which is typical as warmer air can hold more moisture before it reaches saturation. Air pressure has remained relatively stable but showed a slight increase, suggesting stable weather conditions with no immediate sign of significant weather fronts or storms. Wind speeds have been mild to moderate and increased slightly towards the current hour, indicating a possible change in weather patterns or the presence of a weather system nearby. The wind direction has varied significantly, with a drastic shift from southeasterly to northerly, then stabilizing from the north-northeast, which could be indicative of a frontal passage through the region.
