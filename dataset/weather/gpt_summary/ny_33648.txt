Over the last 24 hours in New York City, temperatures have shown a rising trend from the early hours, reaching a peak in the late afternoon before gradually declining into the night. Relative humidity experienced a decrease through the afternoon hours, likely due to increasing temperatures, and then began to increase again as the temperatures started to drop in the evening. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with a slight decrease observed towards the end of the 24-hour timeframe. Wind speeds were consistently light, with very little variation, suggesting a period of calm weather conditions. The wind direction shifted from predominantly southeast to east-northeast in the early hours, before moving towards the south-southeast, and finally settling in a more southward direction, which could have implications for any weather systems approaching from those directions.
