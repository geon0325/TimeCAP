Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicate a steady increase in the proportion of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases across all age groups, with the most significant rise observed in the 0-4 and 5-24 age brackets. The percentage of ILI patients has escalated from 1.79% to 5.74%, surpassing the benchmark of 2.9% in week 16 and continuing to rise sharply thereafter. This surge suggests an ongoing and intensifying influenza season, which could strain healthcare resources due to the higher demand for medical care and potential hospitalizations, particularly among the youngest and school-aged populations. The steep increase in ILI cases among the working-age group (25-49) may also impact workforce productivity and increase the need for workplace healthcare interventions. Proactive public health measures, including vaccination campaigns and awareness programs, are critical to manage this uptrend and alleviate the pressure on healthcare systems.
