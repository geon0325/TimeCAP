Over the last 20 weeks, the incidence of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) across all age groups has demonstrated variability, but overall, it has remained below the baseline threshold that typically signals an influenza outbreak. The highest rates of ILI were observed in the youngest (0-4 years) and school-aged (5-24 years) populations, indicating that these age groups may be the most affected by ILI symptoms and could be a focal point for transmission within communities. Although there has been a notable increase in the number of patients presenting with ILI symptoms in the most recent weeks, the percentage of ILI patients has not surpassed the baseline at any point during the analyzed period. The consistent presence of ILI cases in older adults (50 years and above), although not as pronounced as in younger individuals, suggests a sustained risk of ILI within this demographic, which could have implications for healthcare resource allocation, particularly given the possible severity of ILI in older populations. The healthcare system should remain vigilant and prepared to respond to any signs of an uptick in ILI activity, especially as the percentage of ILI patients has shown a slight upward trend in the most recent data points.
