Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have shown a typical diurnal cycle with a peak during the daytime and a drop towards nighttime, maintaining a generally mild climate. Humidity levels were fairly high throughout the period, suggesting the presence of moisture in the air, which could lead to a feeling of coolness despite moderate temperatures. The air pressure has been gradually decreasing, which could be indicative of an approaching weather system that might lead to changes in weather patterns, including increased chances of precipitation. Wind speeds varied, with stronger gusts earlier in the period, calming down later on, but have recently started to pick up again, which could result in cooler wind chill factors. The prevailing winds were predominantly from the west-northwest, which is typical for San Francisco's coastal climate and can carry marine air into the city, affecting local weather conditions.
