Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, transitioning from cooler conditions in the early hours to warmer temperatures by the end of the period. The relative humidity showed significant variation, with a notable increase towards the latter part of the time frame, suggesting an increase in moisture in the air which could lead to the potential for fog or dew. Air pressure has been on a consistent decline, which could indicate the approach of a weather system that might bring precipitation or a change in weather patterns. Wind speeds varied, with periods of calm and gusts, while the predominant wind direction shifted from northerly to easterly throughout the day. The combination of rising humidity, decreasing air pressure, and shifting wind direction could suggest that Houston may experience unsettled weather conditions in the near future.
