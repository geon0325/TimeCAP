Over the last 20 weeks, the incidence of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) has remained consistently below the baseline threshold, indicating a relatively mild influenza season thus far. The ratio of ILI patients rose modestly towards the end of the period, yet it did not reach levels typically associated with heightened concern. The age groups 0-4 and 5-24 displayed the largest number of ILI cases, which is a common trend due to their high levels of social interaction and susceptibility. While the older age groups (50-64 and 65 or more) showed fewer ILI cases, their typically higher risk of complications from influenza warrants continuous monitoring. Despite the overall low ILI activity, the gradual increase in the ratio of ILI patients in recent weeks suggests the need for ongoing vigilance and preparedness for a potential upswing in influenza cases.
