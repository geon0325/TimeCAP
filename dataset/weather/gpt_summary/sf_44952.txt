Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, the weather has exhibited remarkable stability across several key indicators, which is unusual for a coastal city known for its microclimates and variable conditions. The temperature remained constant, suggesting a persistent weather pattern, possibly influenced by a strong and stationary high-pressure system. The humidity levels were uniformly low, indicating dry air that could increase the risk of dehydration and exacerbate wildfire conditions in nearby regions. Atmospheric pressure showed no variation, reinforcing the presence of a dominant and unchanging weather system over the area. Finally, wind conditions were steady in both speed and direction, providing a consistent onshore flow that could have contributed to maintaining the unchanging temperature and humidity levels.
