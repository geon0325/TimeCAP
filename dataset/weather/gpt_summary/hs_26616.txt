Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a noticeable increase in temperature during the daytime, peaking in the late afternoon, followed by a decrease towards the evening, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, consistent with higher nighttime relative humidity, and subsequently decreased significantly as temperatures rose, suggesting conditions became considerably drier. Air pressure showed a gradual increase throughout the period, implying a potential trend towards more stable weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally light and variable, with a notable shift in wind direction from southeasterly to northerly and finally easterly, which could influence local weather patterns, such as bringing cooler air from different regions or possibly affecting moisture levels. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and increasing pressure may suggest a trend towards clearer and more stable weather conditions for Houston in the short term.
