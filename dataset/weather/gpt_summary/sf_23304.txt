Humidity levels were high and reached saturation at several points throughout the night and early morning, suggesting the possibility of fog or mist formation that could impact visibility. Air pressure has remained stable, indicating that no significant weather fronts are moving through the area. Wind speeds have been generally light, though there was a slight increase later in the period, which could contribute to a dispersal of any early fog or low clouds. The wind direction has been variable but predominantly from the southwest, which is typical for the region and may bring cooler maritime air inland.
