Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 experienced an initial increase, reaching a peak of 4796.56, before undergoing a notable decline to 4577.11, which may suggest increased market volatility or investor concern. This is reflected in the VIX, which saw a decrease to a low of 16.60 before rising sharply to 22.79, indicating heightened market uncertainty. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 showed some fluctuations, with the Nikkei witnessing a dip towards the end and the FTSE maintaining an upward trend, closing slightly higher, which could signal regional economic disparities. Commodity prices for Gold Futures remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, closing slightly higher, whereas Crude Oil Futures showed a consistent upward trend, ending at 85.43, which may impact inflation and consumer spending. Currency exchange rates saw the EUR/USD ranging narrowly around 1.13-1.14, while the USD/JPY and USD/CNY pairings exhibited slight depreciation of the USD, suggesting a potential shift in currency strength dynamics.
