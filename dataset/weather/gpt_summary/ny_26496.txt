Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature followed by a slight decrease, marking a typical diurnal pattern with warmer temperatures in the afternoon. Humidity levels have shown significant fluctuation, with particularly high values during the early hours, which decreased as the temperature peaked, suggesting possible early morning fog or mist clearing as the day progressed. Air pressure has been on a slow decline throughout the period, which could be indicative of an approaching weather system that may affect the city's weather in the near future. Wind speeds have been generally light but picked up slightly in the afternoon, which, combined with lower humidity, could have contributed to a more comfortable perceived temperature. Wind direction has been variable, with a notable shift from southerly to westerly winds, which could be associated with the passage of a weather front and subsequent changes in weather conditions.
