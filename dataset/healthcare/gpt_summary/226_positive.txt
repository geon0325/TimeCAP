Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant decline in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a peak of over 30% positive specimens in the early weeks to under 0.4% in the most recent week. Both Influenza A and B show a declining trend in positivity rates, with Influenza A decreasing from 18.03% to 0.23% and Influenza B from 12.23% to 0.15%. The number of specimens tested also decreased dramatically, from 71,868 in the first week to 5,247 in the last week, potentially indicating a decrease in the prevalence of influenza-like illness or a reduction in testing. The initial high percentage of positive specimens suggests a significant burden on the healthcare system which would have necessitated a robust response in terms of resources and treatment strategies. The current low positivity rates may indicate that the influenza season is ending, but continued surveillance is essential to detect any potential changes in the virus's spread or mutation.
