Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable increase in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the average positive ratio starting at 2.40% and rising sharply to 16.15% by the end of the period. The data reflects a more pronounced rise in Influenza B detections, which surged from 1.08% to 11.35%, compared to Influenza A that increased from 1.32% to 4.81%. The week-over-week growth rate of positive specimens for Influenza B significantly outpaced that of Influenza A, particularly in the later weeks, suggesting a dominant and expanding influence of the B strain in the current flu season. This trend places an increasing burden on healthcare resources, indicating a need for enhanced flu surveillance, vaccination efforts, and possibly antiviral treatment readiness. The substantial rise in positive influenza cases could suggest an approaching peak in flu activity, necessitating public health preparedness for a potential surge in healthcare demand.
