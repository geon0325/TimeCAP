Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced relatively stable temperatures with minor fluctuations, maintaining a mild to warm environment typical for this region. The humidity levels have been high, particularly towards the latter part of the period, reaching a peak that suggests an increased likelihood of precipitation or muggy conditions. Air pressure showed a slight declining trend over the day, which could indicate the potential for changing weather patterns, including the development of storm systems. Wind speeds were moderate and consistent, with no significant gusts, providing steady conditions that did not contribute to any rapid weather changes. The wind direction was predominantly from the south to the southeast, which is often associated with the transportation of moisture-laden air from the Gulf of Mexico, possibly contributing to the high humidity levels observed.
