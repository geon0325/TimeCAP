Over the last 24 hours in New York City, temperatures have shown a slight fluctuation, experiencing a general decrease before rising moderately and then falling once more, indicating a potentially unstable air mass over the region. Humidity levels varied significantly, starting at moderate levels, spiking to saturation, dropping to lower levels, and then increasing again sharply by the end of the period, suggesting the passage of a frontal system which could have been responsible for precipitation and changes in temperature. Air pressure remained relatively stable initially, with a minor increase mid-period, followed by a slight decrease, and then stabilization, which is indicative of a transient high-pressure system affecting the area. Wind speeds were mostly gentle to moderate throughout the period but showed some increase towards the end, pointing towards the movement of air masses that could lead to changing weather conditions. Wind direction was predominantly from the northwest, with a brief shift to the southwest, and then returning to a northwesterly flow, which typically brings cooler and drier air to the region.
