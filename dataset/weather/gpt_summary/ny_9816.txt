Over the last 24 hours in New York City, temperatures have experienced a gradual increase followed by a slight decrease towards the end of the period, indicating a typical diurnal pattern with warmer conditions during the day that cooled off at night. Humidity levels were relatively low in the early hours but saw an increase later, which could suggest a more comfortable or muggier feel to the air depending on the concurrent temperature. Air pressure remained stable for most of the period but experienced a significant drop towards the end, potentially signaling an approaching weather system that could lead to changing weather conditions such as increased wind speeds or precipitation. Wind speeds varied moderately throughout the day, with periods of lighter winds, and the wind direction was predominantly from the south to the southwest, which is typical for warmer weather patterns in the region. The variation in wind direction towards the end of the period could also be associated with the change in weather conditions suggested by the drop in air pressure.
