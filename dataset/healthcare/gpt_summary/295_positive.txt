The data indicates a gradual increase in the number of respiratory specimens tested for influenza over the last 20 weeks, with a peak at week 19, suggesting heightened surveillance or an increase in respiratory illnesses prompting testing. Despite fluctuations, the overall percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza has remained below the 20-week average of 6.26%, with a notable uptick in the positive ratio in the last three weeks, reaching its highest at 0.16% in week 19. Influenza B has consistently been more prevalent than Influenza A, with its percentage of positive specimens surpassing that of Influenza A in all but two weeks. The increasing trend in the positivity ratio for both types of influenza in recent weeks could be indicative of the onset of a seasonal outbreak, necessitating preparedness in healthcare settings for a potential rise in influenza cases. The overall low positivity rate suggests that influenza is not widespread at this time, but the recent increase may require close monitoring and potentially greater allocation of healthcare resources to manage a surge.
