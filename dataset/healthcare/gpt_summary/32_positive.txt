Over the past 20 weeks, the ratio of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza has fluctuated below the average of 6.26%, with a recent slight uptrend, reaching 1.78% in the latest week. The data shows a consistent dominance of Influenza B over Influenza A in the proportion of positive cases, though both subtypes have seen an increase in recent weeks. The lowest overall positivity rate was observed in week 9 (0.85%), and since then, there has been a gradual increase, which may indicate a rising trend of influenza activity. Despite the increase, the overall positivity rates for both Influenza A and B remain relatively low, suggesting the current strain on the healthcare system due to influenza is manageable but should be monitored for potential increases. Healthcare providers should remain vigilant for changes in trends and consider the increase in influenza cases when planning resource allocation and public health interventions.
