Over the past 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a downward trend, decreasing from 4155.17 to 3986.16, indicating a potential increase in market pessimism or risk-off sentiment. The VIX, commonly known as the "fear gauge," has risen from 21.95 to 26.21, which aligns with the observed decrease in the S&P 500, suggesting higher market volatility and investor uncertainty. In contrast, the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 indices have both depicted relative stability with a slight upward bias, closing higher at the end of the period, which may indicate a divergence in regional market performance. Gold Futures have experienced a general decline from 1758.00 to 1723.20, reflecting possible strength in the USD or reduced demand for safe-haven assets; this is further corroborated by the strengthening of the USD against major currencies, with EUR/USD dropping from 1.02 to 1.00 and USD/CNY increasing from 6.75 to 6.91, signaling a stronger dollar environment. Lastly, Crude Oil Futures showed volatility with a general downtrend from 90.66 to 91.64, which could suggest concerns over global demand or potential impacts from geopolitical factors.
