Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the weather has shown a gradual increase in temperature, indicating a warming trend. Humidity levels remained high throughout the period, often reaching saturation, which could have led to a muggy feeling and potential for fog or dew. Air pressure experienced a slight but consistent decline, suggesting that a weather system may be moving into the area, which could lead to changing weather patterns, such as increased cloudiness or precipitation. Wind speeds varied but were generally moderate, with a few hours of higher gusts, which could have dispersed humidity and influenced the thermal comfort level. The wind direction was predominantly from the south, which is typical for bringing warmer air into the region, contributing to the observed increase in temperature.
