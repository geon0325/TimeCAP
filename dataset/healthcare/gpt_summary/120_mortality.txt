Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a consistent decline in mortality due to Influenza or Pneumonia when compared to the total number of deaths. The number of deaths attributed to Influenza has decreased significantly, from 156 in the first week to 12 in the last week, suggesting a potential reduction in Influenza transmission or improved clinical outcomes. Deaths from Pneumonia also show a downward trend, albeit less pronounced, from 3273 to 2583 over the period. Interestingly, the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia to the total number of deaths has steadily decreased from 6.39% to 5.01%, sitting below the 20-week average of 7.84%. This trend could indicate effective public health interventions, seasonal variations affecting disease spread, or better healthcare management, but it also necessitates continued surveillance to manage the burden on healthcare resources effectively.
