Over the last 20 weeks, the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data has demonstrated a consistent upward trend in the percentage of ILI patients across all age groups, although the overall rate remains below the baseline of 2.9% used to determine the severity of the influenza situation. The most significant increase in ILI cases has been observed in the youngest (0-4 years) and school-aged children (5-24 years), which could suggest higher transmission rates within these age groups that often exhibit high levels of social interaction. Adults aged 25-49 and older adults (50-64, 65 and above) have also shown a rise in ILI cases, but the rate of increase is less pronounced compared to the younger age groups. Despite the increasing trend, the current ILI percentage is still within a range that the healthcare system is typically equipped to manage without the strain seen at higher ILI activity levels. However, continued monitoring is necessary to rapidly identify and respond to any potential shifts in the trend that might signal a more significant health threat, particularly as the ILI ratio approaches the baseline threshold.
