Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a slight increase in temperature, followed by a mild cooling trend towards the latter part of the period. Humidity levels have shown fluctuations with a noticeable peak around the middle of the day, suggesting the possibility of a more muggy feeling in the air or potential for morning fog that is typical for the region. Air pressure has seen a gradual decline throughout the period, which could indicate an approaching weather system that may bring changes in weather conditions. Wind speeds have been variable with some hours experiencing calmer conditions and others more breezy, which is not uncommon for coastal cities like San Francisco. Wind direction was predominantly from the south to the southeast, with occasional shifts, which could contribute to variations in temperature and moisture transport from the ocean inland.
