Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a noticeable fluctuation in temperature with a warming trend towards the latter part of the period. Humidity levels have shown significant variability, reaching saturation at one point but generally decreasing towards the end of the period, indicating drier conditions moving in. Air pressure has been relatively stable with a slight increase in the latter hours, suggesting a potential change in weather patterns. Wind speeds have been consistently light and variable, with a notable shift in wind direction from predominantly westerly to northerly, which could influence coastal conditions and temperature distribution. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and stable but slightly increasing air pressure could be indicative of fair weather, but the wind direction shift suggests a possible change in weather systems affecting San Francisco.
