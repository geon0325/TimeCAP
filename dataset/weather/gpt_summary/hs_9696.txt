Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the weather has exhibited a gradual increase in temperature reaching a peak in the late afternoon before cooling slightly towards the evening. Humidity levels showed a significant decrease as the temperature peaked, suggesting the presence of drier air moving into the area during the hottest part of the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable with only minor fluctuations, indicating a period of consistent weather patterns without the immediate threat of significant storms or fronts. Wind conditions were unusually calm throughout the day, with both wind speed and direction remaining steady, which could have contributed to the buildup of heat without much relief. The combination of rising temperatures, lowering humidity, and steady pressure suggests a stable but warm weather pattern for Houston, possibly leading to the need for cooling measures and hydration for residents.
