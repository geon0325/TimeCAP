Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before cooling down slightly. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with a notable peak coinciding with the coolest part of the early morning, indicative of possible morning fog or dew. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight decrease later in the period, which could be associated with the development of unsettled weather. Wind speeds showed some variability, with occasional increases that could contribute to brisk conditions, especially when combined with the highest temperatures of the day. The wind direction was predominantly from the north, shifting to easterly and southeasterly directions at times, which is typical for Houston's weather patterns and could be a factor in temperature and humidity variations observed.
