Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 index showed a general upward trend, closing higher by approximately 2.27% from 3283.15 to 3357.75, indicating a bullish sentiment among investors. The VIX, also known as the fear gauge, remained relatively low with a slight increase, suggesting that market volatility is present but not excessively high. The Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 experienced overall declines, with the former closing flat in the last two sessions, which might reflect concerns about regional economic factors and market uncertainties.

Gold futures saw a rise, peaking at 1583.50 before retreating slightly, which is indicative of investors seeking safe-haven assets amidst market fluctuations. The exchange rates for EUR/USD and USD/JPY remained relatively stable with minor depreciations in the value of the dollar, while USD/CNY saw a modest increase in volatility, ending slightly higher, which could be reflective of trade sentiment and currency market reactions to global economic policies.
