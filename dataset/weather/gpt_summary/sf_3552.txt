Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have shown a typical diurnal pattern, decreasing overnight to reach a minimum in the early hours before steadily increasing throughout the day. Humidity levels have fluctuated significantly, starting at moderate values before rising to very high levels during the night, indicative of possible fog or low clouds conditions, and then sharply dropping in the afternoon, suggesting clearer skies. Air pressure has been relatively stable, with a slight increase at one point, which is usually associated with stable weather conditions, but it has shown a gradual declining trend, which could hint at an approaching weather system. Wind speeds varied, with stronger winds earlier in the period calming down to almost still conditions, followed by a late increase, which could influence the dispersion of fog or low clouds if present. Wind direction has been variable, predominantly coming from the west and occasionally shifting, which is consistent with the maritime influences typical for San Francisco's climate.
