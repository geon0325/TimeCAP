The VIX, a measure of market volatility, has generally trended downwards from 21.14 to 18.83, which could indicate increasing market stability. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 have both shown signs of recovery after initial drops, with the FTSE 100 reaching a 20-day high of 7794.00, suggesting investor confidence may be improving in these regions. Gold futures have been on an upward trend, increasing from 1807.50 to 1895.50, which may signal a flight to safety or inflationary concerns among investors. Lastly, the USD has strengthened against the JPY and CNY across the period, but it has weakened against the EUR, moving from 1.06 to 1.08 EUR/USD, implying potential shifts in currency markets that could affect international trading and investment dynamics.
