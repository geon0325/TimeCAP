Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have exhibited a natural diurnal variation, with a gradual decrease throughout the night reaching the lowest point at dawn, followed by a steady rise after sunrise. Humidity levels have remained high throughout the day, suggesting a notable amount of moisture in the air, which could lead to a feeling of mugginess or the potential for fog, especially during the cooler night and early morning hours. Air pressure has been relatively stable, with only minor fluctuations, indicating a period of consistent weather without the immediate influence of strong weather fronts or systems. Wind speeds have been light and variable, often calm, which could contribute to the potential for poor air dispersion and accumulation of pollutants. The wind direction has shown some variability but predominantly from the west, which is typical for San Francisco given its coastal location and the influence of the Pacific Ocean.
