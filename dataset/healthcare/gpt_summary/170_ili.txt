Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a downward trend in the ratio of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) patients across all age groups, with the percentage dropping below the baseline threshold early in the period and continuing to decrease. This suggests a declining prevalence of ILI symptoms among the patient population. The most significant decreases were observed in the youngest (0-4 years) and school-aged children (5-24 years), which could be associated with the end of the traditional flu season or effective public health measures. However, in the most recent weeks, there has been a slight uptick in ILI ratios, hinting at a potential resurgence of ILI cases that healthcare systems should monitor closely. The consistent decline over several weeks followed by a recent increase may warrant further investigation into possible causes, such as emerging viral strains or changes in community transmission dynamics.
