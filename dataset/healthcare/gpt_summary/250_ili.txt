The analysis of the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data over the last 20 weeks reveals a significant upward trend in the percentage of ILI patients, surpassing the baseline of 2.9% in the latter half of the observed period. This rise correlates with increased ILI cases across all age groups, with the most marked increase observed in the 5-24 and 25-49 age brackets, typically associated with school-aged children and their parents. The peak in ILI patient ratios occurred in the middle of the time series, with a subsequent decline yet remaining above baseline levels, indicating a potential ongoing transmission within the community. The elderly population (age 65 or more) showed a less pronounced increase in ILI cases compared to other age groups, but the numbers remain concerning due to the increased risk of complications in this demographic. The sustained elevation in ILI patient ratios suggests a continued strain on healthcare resources, emphasizing the need for public health interventions to mitigate the spread of influenza and related respiratory illnesses.
