Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures exhibited a slight fluctuation with a general cooling trend during the nighttime hours, followed by a modest warming trend as the day progressed. The humidity levels remained at saturation throughout the entire period, which suggests the presence of fog or consistent low-level cloud cover. Atmospheric pressure saw a gradual and steady increase, indicating a strengthening high-pressure system that is typically associated with stable weather conditions. Wind speeds were light and showed little variation, which is common for coastal areas under the influence of a high-pressure system. Wind direction varied significantly, ranging from southerly to northerly and back to easterly, which could be indicative of shifting weather patterns or local topographical influences on the wind flow.
