Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable increase in the proportion of deaths attributed to influenza and pneumonia when compared to the total number of deaths, with the ratio rising from an initial 5.40% to a peak of 8.33% in the penultimate week before dropping to 7.09%. The total number of deaths has also been on an upward trend, increasing from 50,459 to 58,285. Notably, deaths from influenza saw a significant spike, escalating from single digits in the first few weeks to a high of 671, suggesting a possible outbreak or increased virulence of the influenza virus. Pneumonia-related deaths have shown a steady increase as well, with the numbers rising from 2,713 to 3,919. The rising mortality rates from these respiratory conditions could indicate heightened stress on the healthcare system, necessitating increased resources for treatment and prevention measures.
