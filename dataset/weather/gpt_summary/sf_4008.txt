Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a noticeable cooling trend in temperature, which is typical during the nighttime hours, followed by a gradual increase as the day progresses. Humidity levels have experienced significant fluctuations, starting relatively low, increasing substantially to near saturation, and then falling again, indicative of a passing weather system or change in marine influence. Air pressure showed variability with a notable spike, which could suggest the transient influence of a high-pressure system, potentially leading to clearer skies. Wind speed oscillated, with calm conditions interspersed with periods of moderate winds, while wind direction shifted substantially, indicating changing weather patterns or the presence of varying air masses over the region. Overall, these indicators suggest dynamic weather conditions, with transitions between different air masses and the possibility of variable weather in the short term.
