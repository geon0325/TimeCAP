Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a notable increase in temperature, transitioning from cooler to warmer conditions as the day progressed. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with periods of higher humidity aligning with cooler temperatures earlier in the day, while lower humidity was observed as temperatures peaked. Air pressure was relatively stable, with a slight decreasing trend towards the latter part of the day, which could indicate an approaching weather system or front. Wind speeds varied, with a peak in intensity occurring earlier in the period, and winds predominantly came from a westerly direction, shifting slightly throughout the day. The combination of rising temperatures, variable humidity, and changing wind patterns could suggest the potential for dynamic weather conditions, possibly leading to the development of fog, which is common in the San Francisco area.
