Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 index has experienced significant volatility, beginning at 4121.43 and seeing a downward trend with a notable dip to 3666.77 before a partial recovery to 3831.39, reflecting investor uncertainty in the equity markets. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, has generally remained elevated, spiking to as high as 34.02 during this period, which corroborates the observed unease among investors. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have also faced downward pressures, with the Nikkei 225 falling from 27915.89 to 26423.47 and the FTSE 100 declining from 7608.20 to 7025.50, indicating a broader global market retreat. Commodity prices have shown mixed movements with Gold Futures dropping from 1839.20 to 1761.80, suggesting a sell-off in safe-haven assets, while Crude Oil Futures experienced high volatility with a peak of 122.11 before sharply falling to 99.50, which could indicate concerns over future demand amidst economic uncertainty. Exchange rates reveal a slight weakening of the US dollar against the Yen and the Euro over the period, while remaining relatively stable against the Chinese Yuan, suggesting mixed sentiment in currency markets.
