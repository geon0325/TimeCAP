Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the latter part of the day before slightly tapering off. Humidity levels displayed significant variance, with the highest levels observed during the cooler early hours and the lowest in the warmer late afternoon, indicative of typical diurnal patterns. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day with only minor fluctuations, which suggests a period of steady weather conditions. Wind speeds varied modestly but ended the period on a stronger note, possibly leading to cooler perceived temperatures and increased wind chill. Wind direction shifted considerably throughout the day, starting with calm conditions, later transitioning to a northerly direction, and finally shifting to come predominantly from the south, which could be associated with the movement of weather systems through the area.
