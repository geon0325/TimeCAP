Over the past day in San Francisco, the weather has exhibited a cooling trend with the temperature dropping significantly before partially rebounding. Humidity levels were considerably high, especially during the cooler hours, which is indicative of a moist air mass in the region and could lead to fog formation, particularly in the early morning. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable, with only a slight decrease, suggesting that no significant weather fronts are moving through the area. Wind speeds were light throughout the period, which is typical for the region and could contribute to the potential for fog or low-lying clouds due to the lack of air mixing. The wind direction fluctuated but primarily came from the west-northwest, which is common along the California coast due to the influence of the Pacific Ocean's prevailing winds.
