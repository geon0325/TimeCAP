Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a gradual decrease in temperature, indicating a cooling trend. Humidity levels have risen consistently throughout the period, reaching near saturation, which could be indicative of potential fog formation or precipitation. Air pressure has been decreasing steadily, a trend that often precedes unsettled weather conditions, possibly suggesting an approaching weather system. Wind speeds have remained relatively steady, with a slight decrease towards the end of the period, while the wind has been predominantly blowing from the southeasterly direction with some minor fluctuations, which is typical for this region. The combination of high humidity, lowering air pressure, and stable wind conditions may lead to increased cloud cover and a chance of rain or thunderstorms in the near future.
