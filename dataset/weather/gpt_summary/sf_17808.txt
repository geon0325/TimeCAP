Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature with a noticeable cooling trend during the night that slightly warmed up by the afternoon. Humidity levels remained relatively high throughout the period, increasing significantly overnight which could have led to misty conditions in the early hours. Air pressure remained fairly stable with a gradual decrease, suggesting no major weather fronts moving in but possibly a slight change in weather patterns. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, increasing towards the end of the observation period, which could contribute to cooler perceived temperatures and the dispersal of any coastal fog. The wind direction was predominantly from the southwest to west, common for coastal areas in this region and consistent with the marine influence on San Francisco's weather.
