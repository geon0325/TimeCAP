Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a slight upward trend, closing higher by approximately 2.32% from 4432.35 to 4535.43, which may indicate a cautiously optimistic outlook among investors. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting that investors are not expecting significant market turbulence in the near term. International equity markets reflected a mixed sentiment, with Japan's Nikkei 225 rising sharply by 4.7%, indicating stronger investor confidence in the Asian markets, while the UK's FTSE 100 showed more subdued activity, closing marginally higher by 0.09%. Gold futures experienced an increment, closing up 6.23% which could signal a flight to safety or a hedge against potential inflation. Meanwhile, Crude Oil futures also increased slightly by 4.23%, and currency exchange rates remained relatively stable, with a slight weakening of the USD against the EUR and JPY, and stable against the CNY, which might reflect the currency market's wait-and-see approach amidst global economic uncertainties.
