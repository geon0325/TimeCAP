Over the last 20 weeks, the data shows that the average ratio of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza is below the provided average of 6.26%, indicating a lower incidence of confirmed influenza cases. Influenza B has consistently shown higher positivity rates compared to Influenza A, suggesting that it is the predominant strain in the current time period. There has been a downward trend in the total number of specimens tested from the beginning of the time series to the end, which could potentially mask the true prevalence of influenza if the testing volume correlates with a decrease in surveillance. The overall percentage of positive specimens for both influenza types has fluctuated but remained generally stable with a slight increase in the most recent weeks. This trend suggests that while influenza is present, it is not currently surging; however, healthcare systems should remain vigilant for any signs of increasing activity, especially given the recent uptick in positive specimens.
