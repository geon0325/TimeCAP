Over the past 20 weeks, the data indicates a significant decline in the number of patients experiencing influenza-like illness (ILI) across all age groups. Initially, the ratio of ILI patients was more than double the baseline threshold, suggesting a possibly heightened influenza activity period. However, as weeks progressed, there was a steady decrease in the ratio, eventually falling below the baseline, which may indicate a tapering off of the flu season or successful containment and treatment efforts. The most substantial decrease in ILI cases was observed in the younger age groups, which could be attributed to factors such as the end of a school term or effective vaccination strategies among children and young adults. This downward trend in ILI cases likely reflects reduced pressure on healthcare resources, allowing for a potential reallocation of efforts towards other pressing health concerns.
