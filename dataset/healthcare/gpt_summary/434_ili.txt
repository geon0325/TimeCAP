Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a steady decline in the proportion of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases relative to total patient counts, with the percentage falling from 2.02% to 1.99%. Despite this decrease, the percentage of ILI patients has not reached the benchmark severity level of 2.9% at any point during the observed period. The age group 0-4 consistently had the highest number of ILI cases, suggesting a greater susceptibility or a higher incidence of ILI in this demographic. There was a noticeable peak in ILI cases for all age groups around week 16, with a subsequent decline, indicating a potential seasonal trend. Healthcare systems should remain vigilant for any upward trends in ILI cases, particularly focusing on preventive measures and surveillance in the youngest age group.
