Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures exhibited a slight diurnal variation, with a noticeable cooling trend in the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend later in the day. Relative humidity levels were high throughout the period, reaching saturation during the night and early morning, indicating a possibility of fog or low clouds, particularly when coupled with the low wind speeds observed. Air pressure decreased slightly but remained relatively high, suggesting stable weather conditions are prevailing. Wind speeds were generally light, with very little variation, which might have contributed to the high humidity levels due to reduced air circulation. The wind direction was predominantly from the west-northwest, which is typical for the region, but showed some variability, shifting slightly throughout the day.
