Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a downtrend, dropping from 4631.60 to 4175.20, which reflects increased market uncertainty and potentially bearish sentiment among investors. Concurrently, the VIX, a measure of market volatility, has risen significantly from 18.90 to 33.52, suggesting heightened market anxiety and risk aversion. In international markets, both the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 experienced volatility, with the Nikkei showing a slight decline and the FTSE 100 experiencing fluctuations but ending slightly lower, indicating global market instability. Commodity prices have also been mixed, with Gold Futures seeing an initial rise followed by a decline to 1901.40, and Crude Oil Futures experiencing notable volatility but closing relatively higher, which may be indicative of geopolitical factors affecting commodity markets. Exchange rates have seen the weakening of the Euro and the Chinese Yuan against the US Dollar, with EUR/USD moving from 1.10 to 1.07 and USD/CNY from 6.37 to 6.56 respectively, while the Japanese Yen has seen fluctuations with overall depreciation against the dollar, moving from 123.66 to 127.74, reflecting broader currency market movements and possibly shifts in trade balances or monetary policy expectations.
