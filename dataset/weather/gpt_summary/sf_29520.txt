Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual decline in temperature followed by a noticeable increase towards the current hour, suggesting a typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels have varied significantly, with very high humidity observed during one period, which could have resulted in foggy conditions or a higher chance of precipitation. Air pressure has remained relatively stable with a slight fluctuation, but a recent increase may indicate the arrival of a high-pressure system, potentially leading to clearer skies. Wind speeds have mostly been moderate but showed some variability with occasional higher gusts; the direction has primarily shifted between southerly and northerly with a period of westerly winds, which is typical for coastal areas. The combination of these factors points towards a dynamic weather pattern, with changes in wind direction and speed likely influencing temperature and humidity levels throughout the day.
