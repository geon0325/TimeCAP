Over the past 20 weeks, the data indicates a declining trend in the incidence of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) across all age groups, with the percentage of ILI patients consistently falling below the 2.9% severity threshold. The highest concentration of ILI cases was observed among patients aged 0-4 and 5-24, although these also showed a downward trend. The ratio of ILI patients peaked at 2.64% in week 1 and has since decreased steadily to 1.32% in week 20, indicating a significant reduction in ILI prevalence. The consistent decrease in the ILI ratio suggests that the influenza situation is currently under control; however, this trend will need to continue to be monitored, especially in the highest-risk age groups. The reduced strain on healthcare resources due to lower ILI cases could potentially allow for reallocation to other areas of need.
