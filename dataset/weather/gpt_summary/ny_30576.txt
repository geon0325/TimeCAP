Over the last 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, descending to a low before slightly rebounding, which is typical of the diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels varied significantly, with a noticeable dip in the late afternoon, suggesting the possible influence of a dry air mass over the area. Air pressure saw an overall increasing trend, which is indicative of a high-pressure system moving into the region, potentially leading to more stable weather conditions. Wind speeds were moderate to brisk but showed periods of lighter winds around midday. The predominant wind direction was westerly, with a temporary shift to southerly winds before returning to a northwesterly direction, which could have influenced the drop in humidity and the slight fluctuation in temperatures observed.
