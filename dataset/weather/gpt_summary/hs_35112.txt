Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual rise in temperature, reaching its peak during the late afternoon hours, indicative of typical diurnal heating patterns. Concurrently, humidity levels displayed a common inverse relationship with temperature, starting high during the cooler morning hours and then decreasing as temperatures rose, which could have influenced the comfort levels and heat index perceived by residents. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with a slight decrease observed during the peak heating hours, which is characteristic of daytime atmospheric patterns. Wind speeds were generally light to gentle, with a slight increase towards the end of the period, potentially providing minimal relief from the day's warmth. The wind direction was predominantly from the southeast, shifting slightly throughout the day, which is consistent with the prevailing wind patterns for the region and could have implications for air quality and moisture transport.
