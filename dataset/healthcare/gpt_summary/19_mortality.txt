Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia to the total number of deaths has consistently remained below the average of 7.84%, with a range from 5.36% to 6.20%. The total number of deaths fluctuated slightly but generally hovered around the 50,000 mark per week. Deaths specifically from Influenza showed a decrease in the earlier weeks, followed by a slight increase towards the end, whereas deaths from Pneumonia displayed a more consistent pattern with minor weekly fluctuations. The lowest combined weekly mortality ratio for both diseases was recorded at 5.36%, and the highest was at 6.20%, indicating a relatively stable trend without significant spikes. This steady trend suggests that while Influenza and Pneumonia are persistent concerns, they are not currently increasing as a proportion of total mortality, which could imply that current healthcare measures are effectively managing these diseases without an escalating burden on the healthcare system.
