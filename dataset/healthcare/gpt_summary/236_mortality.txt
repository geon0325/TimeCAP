Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a fluctuating but generally increasing trend in the proportion of deaths attributed to Influenza or Pneumonia, with the percentage rising from an initial 7.27% to a peak of 16.83% by the seventh week, before settling at a higher level of 14.34% in the last recorded week. Notably, while overall mortality fluctuated, the absolute number of deaths from pneumonia showed an upward trend, suggesting a worsening situation for pneumonia-related healthcare burdens. The number of deaths from influenza remained relatively stable and low in comparison to those from pneumonia, implying that pneumonia is the primary driver of the increased mortality ratio. The spike in the ratio of mortality from these conditions during the middle weeks may indicate seasonal patterns or an outbreak that requires careful monitoring and potentially increased healthcare resources. The observed decline in the total number of deaths in the twelfth week, alongside a sharp decrease in the mortality ratio, could be related to external factors such as improved public health interventions or natural variations in disease patterns.
