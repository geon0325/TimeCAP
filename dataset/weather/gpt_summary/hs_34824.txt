Over the last 24 hours in Houston, temperatures exhibited a diurnal pattern with a peak during the afternoon hours and a gradual decline into the evening and night, indicative of typical daytime heating and nighttime cooling. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, showing higher values during the night and early morning, which is common due to lower temperatures and reduced mixing in the atmosphere, and lower values during the peak heating hours of the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight decreasing trend towards the latter part of the period, which could suggest a gradual change in the weather system affecting the area. Wind speeds were generally light and showed a slight increase in the afternoon, which aligns with the development of local thermal circulations as the land heats up. Wind direction varied, predominantly coming from the east to southeast, which is consistent with the Gulf of Mexico's influence on the region's weather patterns, potentially bringing moisture and affecting local humidity levels.
