Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced relatively stable temperatures with a slight fluctuation that is typical for coastal cities. Humidity levels remained at saturation for several hours, indicating the presence of fog or mist, which is a common occurrence in this region, before showing some variability later in the day. Air pressure readings were mostly consistent, with a notable increase during the day, suggesting a transient high-pressure system that could lead to clearer skies. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a significant increase towards the end of the period, which, combined with high humidity, could result in wind-driven mist. The wind direction has been variable, with a predominant movement from the south, shifting to westerly and easterly directions at times, which can affect the distribution of coastal fog and the city's microclimates.
