Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a noticeable increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon hours, indicative of typical diurnal warming. Concurrently, the humidity levels showed a significant decrease during the peak temperature hours, which is common as warmer air can hold more moisture, thus lowering relative humidity. Air pressure varied notably, with a peak that suggests the possible influence of a transient high-pressure system, which generally brings stable weather conditions. Wind speeds remained mostly light with a slight increase during the afternoon, which could be associated with the development of a sea breeze or the heating of the land. Wind direction varied widely throughout the day, suggesting the presence of varying weather systems influencing the local wind patterns in Houston.
