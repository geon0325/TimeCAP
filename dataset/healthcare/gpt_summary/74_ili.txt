The analysis of the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data over the last 20 weeks reveals a gradual increase in the percentage of ILI patients across all age groups, with the ratio of ILI patients rising steadily and surpassing the baseline of 2.9% in recent weeks. The most significant increase in ILI cases is observed in the youngest (0-4 years) and school-aged (5-24 years) cohorts, suggesting a higher transmission rate or susceptibility in these populations. Despite the overall number of patients fluctuating, there is a clear upward trend in the number of ILI cases, indicating a growing burden on the healthcare system. The consistent increase in ILI cases among the elderly (65 years or more) is also concerning, as this age group typically presents a higher risk for complications. These trends underscore the need for enhanced public health interventions, increased surveillance, and potentially heightened preparedness in healthcare settings to manage the rising ILI activity.
