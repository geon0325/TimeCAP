Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a slight decrease in temperature, indicative of a minor cooling trend. The humidity levels have shown fluctuations throughout the day, with a peak during the night to early morning hours, which is typical due to the decrease in temperature and could result in morning fog, especially in coastal and low-lying areas. Air pressure has remained relatively stable, with a minor increase, suggesting steady weather conditions. Wind speeds have varied, with higher speeds observed earlier in the period, and a general decrease towards the latter hours, which could mean less wind chill felt by residents during the night. The wind direction has been predominantly westerly, with occasional variation to southwesterly, which is characteristic of the region's prevailing wind patterns and may affect coastal fog dispersion.
