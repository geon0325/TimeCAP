Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, indicative of a warming trend. Humidity levels fluctuated, starting at moderate values before increasing and then decreasing slightly, which could have affected the perceived comfort level. Air pressure showed a steady decline throughout the period, suggesting a potential change in weather patterns, such as the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds varied, with a general increase toward the end of the period, which might contribute to cooler perceived temperatures and could signal the incoming of a front. The wind direction was predominantly from the south to southeast, shifting more southerly later on, which is typical for bringing in warmer air from the Gulf of Mexico to the Houston area.
