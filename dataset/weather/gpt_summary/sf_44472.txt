Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced remarkably stable weather conditions, with uniform temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed, and wind direction throughout the day. The temperature has remained consistently high, which could be indicative of an ongoing heatwave or unusual weather pattern for the region, considering San Francisco's typical temperate climate. Humidity levels have been low, which, when combined with high temperatures, could increase the risk of heat-related stress and dehydration for the population. The air pressure has stayed constant, suggesting no immediate change in the weather pattern or the approach of new weather systems. The wind has been mild and steady from the same direction, likely providing little relief from the heat and contributing to the stagnation of the current weather conditions.
