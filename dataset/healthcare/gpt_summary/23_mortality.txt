Over the last 20 weeks, the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to total deaths has fluctuated below the average ratio of 7.84%, with a range between 5.36% and 6.19%. The total number of deaths has shown slight variability, with a minor upward trend from 49,362 to 51,876. Deaths specifically from influenza have remained low, with no clear trend, oscillating between 3 and 19 weekly deaths. Pneumonia deaths have been more significant, varying from 2,695 to 3,194, and showing a slight increase in the latter weeks. The observed lower-than-average ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia suggests either a decrease in the severity or incidence of these infections, or an increase in mortality from other causes, potentially indicating a shift in public health priorities or challenges.
