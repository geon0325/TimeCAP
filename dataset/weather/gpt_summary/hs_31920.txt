Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have shown a general increasing trend, culminating in peak warmth during the late afternoon hours before gradually declining towards the evening. Humidity levels started high in the early morning, consistent with the typical diurnal pattern, and then decreased as temperatures rose, suggesting a typical inverse relationship between temperature and humidity throughout the day. Air pressure remained fairly stable, with only minor fluctuations that indicate a relatively calm weather pattern without significant frontal activity. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with some variability, but no strong gusts or calm periods, suggesting steady atmospheric conditions. The wind direction was primarily from the southeast, which is consistent with the region's prevailing wind patterns and may contribute to the moisture levels due to the proximity to the Gulf of Mexico.
