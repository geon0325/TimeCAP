Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a general decline in the ratio of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a peak of 11.91% in week one dropping to a low of 1.90% by week 11, followed by slight fluctuations and a slight increase to 2.36% by week 20. Influenza A showed a more pronounced decrease from a high of 10.12% to a low of 0.94%, indicating a significant reduction in the presence of this strain over the period. In contrast, Influenza B's presence, while also decreasing, showed less variability, with its percentage of positive specimens remaining largely within the 1.56-1.85% range before rising to 1.30% in the last week. The overall average ratio of positive specimens at 6.26% suggests that the current rate is below the average, which may indicate a downward trend in influenza cases or effective control measures. However, the recent upticks in positive specimens for both Influenza A and B in the last few weeks warrant close monitoring to understand if this is an anomaly or the start of a new trend which could impact healthcare resource allocation.
