Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has experienced significant volatility but ended on a positive note with an overall upward trend, closing at 2761.63 up from 2386.13. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, started at a high of 82.69, indicating extreme investor anxiety, but has gradually decreased to 41.17, suggesting a stabilization of market sentiment. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 also reflect a recovery with an upward trajectory despite some fluctuations, closing at 19043.40 and 5842.70, respectively. Commodity prices have seen varied movements with Gold Futures rising from 1485.90 to 1744.80, indicating a flight to safety among investors, while Crude Oil Futures have plummeted to 22.41 from 28.70, likely due to ongoing concerns about global demand and a supply glut. Exchange rates have remained relatively stable with slight variations in EUR/USD, USD/JPY, and USD/CNY, suggesting currency markets are not experiencing the same volatility as equity and commodities markets.
