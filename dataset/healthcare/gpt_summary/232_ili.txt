Over the last 20 weeks, the data shows a steady increase in the ratio of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) patients, with the most recent figure approaching, but still below, the baseline threshold of 2.9% for determining heightened influenza activity. The age group 0-4 years has seen the most significant rise in ILI cases, potentially indicating higher susceptibility or reporting rates within this demographic. The 5-24 year age group follows closely, which may reflect transmission dynamics associated with school and community settings. While the overall number of patients has fluctuated, there has been a marked upward trend in ILI cases across all age groups, suggesting a growing burden on healthcare resources. If the current trend continues, the healthcare system may need to prepare for an influx of ILI cases that could surpass the baseline, necessitating increased vigilance and potentially the allocation of more resources to manage the demand.
