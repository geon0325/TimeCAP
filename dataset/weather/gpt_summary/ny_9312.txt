Over the last 24 hours, New York City experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature, with a general increase during the daytime, followed by a drop and then a stabilization toward the evening hours. Humidity levels varied significantly, reaching a peak during the day, which may have contributed to a feeling of increased warmth, before decreasing as the day progressed into the night. A substantial increase in air pressure was observed during the middle of the day, indicating the likely passage of a high-pressure system, which is often associated with clearer and calmer weather conditions. Wind speeds remained consistently low throughout the period, suggesting a lack of significant wind-related weather events. The wind direction was predominantly from the west, with a slight shift later in the period, which could have influenced the temperature and humidity changes observed.
