Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia has fluctuated significantly, with a notable peak in the total number of deaths attributed to these causes in the 13th week. The proportion of deaths due to Influenza or Pneumonia compared to total deaths started well above the average ratio of 7.84%, reaching its highest at 13.74% in the 12th week, indicating a potential outbreak or increased severity during that period. However, there has been a subsequent decline to below the average ratio, with the last reported value at 6.79%, suggesting a possible easing of the situation. The sharp increase to 887 deaths from influenza in the 13th week requires further investigation to understand any underlying factors, such as a new influenza strain, vaccination rates, or changes in healthcare practices. The overall downward trend in the ratio and the number of deaths in the final weeks of the time series could indicate successful public health interventions or natural progression of seasonal illness patterns.
