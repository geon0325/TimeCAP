Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature from the early morning to the afternoon, followed by a slight decrease towards the late evening, suggesting a typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels were high during the night and early morning hours, reaching saturation at times, which may have led to morning fog or dew; however, humidity levels significantly dropped during the day, which could have resulted in drier conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with a minor drop towards the end of the 24-hour cycle, potentially indicating a weak approaching weather system. Wind speeds varied, with calmer conditions around sunrise, increasing towards the afternoon and evening, which likely helped to disperse humidity later in the day. The predominant wind direction was from the south to southeast, which is common for Houston and can contribute to warm, moist air being drawn in from the Gulf of Mexico.
