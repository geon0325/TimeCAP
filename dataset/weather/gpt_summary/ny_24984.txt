Over the last 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual rise in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before declining slightly towards the evening. Despite fluctuations, humidity levels have largely remained high, suggesting a muggy atmosphere that could be uncomfortable for residents. Air pressure has been remarkably stable throughout the period, indicating a steady weather pattern without significant frontal changes. Wind speeds have varied, with calmer conditions during the early morning hours and increasingly brisk winds later in the day, which may have provided some relief from the humidity. Wind direction has shifted substantially, from southerly to northerly and then to easterly, which could be influencing temperature and humidity variations across the city.
