Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has shown a decreasing trend, transitioning from mild to cooler conditions as the day progressed into the night, and slightly rising again towards the end of the observed period. Humidity levels varied significantly, starting out moderate, dipping to lower levels before rising sharply, indicating potential for early morning condensation or fog development. Air pressure has been steadily increasing, suggesting a period of stable and fair weather conditions. Wind speeds remained mostly moderate throughout the period, with slight fluctuations, but there was no indication of any strong wind events. The wind direction was predominantly from the north and northeast, with brief periods of variable directions, which is consistent with the passage of a frontal system and the subsequent establishment of a cooler air mass over the area.
