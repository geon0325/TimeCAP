Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with an early peak and a declining trend towards the end, closing 3.05% lower than the starting point, indicative of bearish sentiment. The VIX, or fear index, has generally increased, suggesting that market volatility and investor anxiety have risen, which is consistent with the downward movement in the S&P 500. International markets have seen mixed movements; the Nikkei 225 trended upwards by 5.30%, showing relative strength in the Japanese market, whereas the FTSE 100 experienced a slight decrease of 1.36%, reflecting some instability in the UK market. Commodity prices have been rising, with Gold Futures up by 3.54% and Crude Oil Futures up by 9.21%, signaling potential inflationary pressures and increased commodity demand. Exchange rates saw the EUR/USD ending slightly higher, while the USD strengthened against the JPY and CNY, by 4.53% and 1.48% respectively, indicating a flight to the relative safety of the USD amidst market volatility.
