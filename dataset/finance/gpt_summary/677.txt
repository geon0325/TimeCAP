Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with a general downward trend, closing lower on the final day compared to the starting value, indicative of investor uncertainty. The VIX, or Volatility Index, has fluctuated but remained elevated, suggesting a heightened level of market stress and potential for further market swings. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 have also experienced declines, with the Nikkei showing a more pronounced drop, which could reflect broader global economic concerns. Commodity prices have been mixed with Gold Futures relatively stable, indicating sustained investor interest in safe-haven assets, while Crude Oil Futures have trended higher, possibly due to supply concerns or economic recovery expectations. Currency markets have shown the US dollar strengthening against both the Euro and Japanese Yen, while remaining relatively stable against the Chinese Yuan, suggesting a flight to the perceived safety of the dollar amidst market uncertainties.
