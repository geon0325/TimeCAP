Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates that there has been fluctuation in the number of respiratory specimens testing positive for both Influenza A and B, with an overall average positivity ratio of 6.26%. Influenza B started as the predominant strain with higher percentages of positive specimens in the initial weeks, but its prevalence has gradually decreased, reaching its lowest at 0.22% in the final week. In contrast, Influenza A showed an increase in the mid-period with the highest positivity ratio of 0.88% in week 12 but has since stabilized around 0.50% in recent weeks. The total ratio of positive specimens peaked at 1.31% in week 7 and has since shown a general decline, dropping to 0.72% in the last week, which is below the overall average. These trends suggest that while there has been a slight decrease in the immediate burden on the healthcare system, continued surveillance is necessary to monitor these changes and prepare for potential variations in infection rates.
