Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a gradual increase in temperature, peaking during the late afternoon before a slight decline towards the evening. Humidity levels started moderately high and increased to saturation in the early morning, but then significantly dropped as the temperature rose, indicating a typical diurnal pattern. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight fluctuation, ending in a sharp increase, which could suggest an incoming high-pressure system that might lead to clearer skies. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a noticeable increase around midday, and wind direction shifted from southerly to more westerly and northerly as the day progressed, which could be associated with the passage of a weather front. Overall, these indicators suggest a day that started with potential early morning fog or mist due to high humidity and stable conditions, followed by warmer and drier conditions as the day progressed, with the possibility of a high-pressure system influencing the weather towards the end of the period.
