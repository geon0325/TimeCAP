Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, typical of a diurnal cycle transitioning from warmer daytime to cooler nighttime conditions. Humidity levels showed a significant increase during the night, which is common as temperatures drop, potentially leading to early morning fog or dew. There was a notable rise in air pressure, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system which could be associated with more stable weather conditions. Wind speeds remained generally low, indicating a period of calm weather, but the wind direction varied significantly, suggesting the possibility of a shifting weather pattern or the presence of localized weather systems. Overall, the weather in Houston appears to have been relatively stable, but the fluctuations in wind directions could be an indicator of changes to come.
