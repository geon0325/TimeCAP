Over the last 20 weeks, the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data indicate a fluctuating but overall increasing trend in the number of ILI patients across all age groups, reaching a peak before gradually declining towards the end of the period. Despite these fluctuations, the ratio of ILI patients remained well below the baseline threshold of 2.9% throughout the entire period, suggesting the ILI activity was relatively mild in severity. The most significant ILI patient counts were observed in the age groups 25-49 and 50-64, which could indicate higher vulnerability or increased transmission rates within these demographics. The recent downward trend in both the number of ILI patients and the ratio of ILI patients suggests a possible easing of ILI activity. However, healthcare systems should remain vigilant as such trends could reverse, and sustained monitoring is required to anticipate and manage potential increases in ILI cases.
