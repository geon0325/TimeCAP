Over the last 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have shown a mild fluctuation with a general trend of cooling as the day progressed into the night. Humidity levels have been high, steadily increasing and reaching saturation by the end of the period, which could indicate the presence or development of fog, mist, or a higher likelihood of precipitation. Air pressure has been gradually decreasing, suggesting that a weather system could be moving into the area, potentially bringing changes in weather patterns, such as increased cloudiness or a chance of rain. Wind speeds remained relatively light to gentle throughout the period, with no significant gusts that would impact conditions severely. Wind direction varied but primarily came from the east to southeast, which is typical for Houston and may bring moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, contributing to the high humidity levels observed.
