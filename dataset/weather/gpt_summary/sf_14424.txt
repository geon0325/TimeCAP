Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a moderate temperature fluctuation, with a cooling trend during the early hours before warming up again towards the afternoon. Humidity levels were relatively high throughout the day but showed some variation, indicating possible changes in atmospheric moisture that could affect comfort levels. Air pressure remained fairly steady for most of the period before showing a noticeable decrease, which might suggest an approaching weather system or front. Wind speeds varied, with some stronger gusts at times, but overall maintained a moderate pace, and the predominant wind direction shifted from northerly in the early hours to westerly, then became variable towards the end of the period. These indicators suggest that there could be a developing weather situation, possibly involving increased cloudiness or a chance of precipitation following the drop in pressure.
