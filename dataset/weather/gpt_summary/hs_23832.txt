Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature demonstrated a diurnal pattern with a noticeable increase during the daytime and a decrease overnight, reaching its peak in the late afternoon. Relative humidity levels fluctuated significantly, reaching their highest point during the early morning hours, which is typical due to cooler temperatures and could have led to morning fog or dew. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable with a slight decrease towards the end of the period, indicating stable weather conditions but potentially hinting at a change in the weather pattern soon. Wind speeds were mostly light to gentle and showed little variation throughout the period, suggesting a calm weather situation without significant wind-related impacts. The wind direction was predominantly from the southerly quadrant, which in Houston is often associated with warm air being drawn in from the Gulf of Mexico, potentially contributing to higher humidity levels and warmer temperatures.
