Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a declining trend in the proportion of deaths attributable to influenza and pneumonia when compared to total deaths, with a slight uptick in the most recent weeks. The average ratio of mortality from these causes has slightly decreased from the 20-week average of 7.84% to recent values hovering around or below 6.42%. The number of deaths from influenza has increased in the last four weeks after reaching its lowest point in week 13, suggesting potential seasonal variability or changes in the influenza virus's prevalence. Pneumonia-related deaths have shown less fluctuation, yet there's a noticeable decrease from the beginning of the time series, with a very slight recent increase. This observed pattern might necessitate continued vigilance in monitoring respiratory illnesses and possibly adjusting healthcare resource allocation as the latest data suggests a potential rise in influenza-related mortality.
