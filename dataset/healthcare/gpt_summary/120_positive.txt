Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable decline in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the ratio of positive specimens decreasing from a peak of 27.37% to 1.58%. The number of specimens tested has also decreased over time, from 80,322 to 9,703, possibly indicating a reduction in the spread of influenza or a decrease in testing demand. Influenza A has consistently shown a higher positivity rate than Influenza B, although both subtypes have followed a similar downward trend. The most significant drop in positive specimens was observed for Influenza B, which decreased from a high of 10.95% to 0.82%, suggesting a more substantial reduction in Influenza B transmission or incidence. These trends could indicate a waning influenza season, potentially easing the burden on healthcare systems, but continuous monitoring is essential to detect any changes in the pattern that may require a public health response.
