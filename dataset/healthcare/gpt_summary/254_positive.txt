Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the number of respiratory specimens tested for influenza, with a peak of 42,526 tests conducted in week 16. The proportion of specimens testing positive for influenza has remained below the 20-week average of 6.26%, with a maximum positive ratio of 0.40% in week 5. Influenza B has consistently shown a higher positivity rate than Influenza A, peaking at 0.22% in week 5 compared to Influenza A's peak of 0.17% in the same week. There has been a gradual increase in the number of positive specimens for both Influenza A and B towards the latter weeks, with Influenza B showing a more pronounced rise, suggesting a potential trend towards a greater incidence of Influenza B infections. This trend could indicate the need for increased vigilance and possibly a review of vaccination and treatment strategies, especially considering the impact on healthcare resources and the importance of differentiating between influenza types for effective patient management.
