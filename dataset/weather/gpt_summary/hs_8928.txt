Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature exhibited a diurnal pattern, starting off cooler in the early hours, warming significantly through the afternoon, and then cooling again during the night. While the temperature rose, the relative humidity decreased, indicating an inverse relationship typical of daytime heating. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with only minor fluctuations, suggesting a stable weather pattern without significant frontal activity. Wind speeds were mostly light and variable, contributing to the lack of significant dispersion of humidity and heat. Wind direction varied, with a general shift from northeasterly in the early hours to southeasterly towards the end, which may have contributed to the influx of warmer air and a decrease in humidity as the day progressed.
