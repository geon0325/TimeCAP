Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before slightly decreasing towards the evening. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, with very high levels in the early morning hours, indicative of potential fog or dew formation, followed by a decrease as temperatures peaked, which is typical for diurnal patterns. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, but a notable drop occurred mid-day, which could have been associated with transient weather systems passing through the area. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate throughout the day, with slight variations that wouldn't likely impact weather conditions significantly. The prevailing wind direction was mostly southerly to southwesterly, which in Houston could contribute to warmer and more humid conditions due to air coming from the Gulf of Mexico.
