Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have experienced a slight fluctuation with a noticeable decrease during the early hours, followed by a gradual increase towards the latter part of the series, indicating typical diurnal variation. Relative humidity levels have shown some variation, with peaks suggesting the presence of moisture that could contribute to morning or evening fogginess, a common occurrence in the region. Air pressure has remained relatively stable, with a slight decrease towards the end of the 24-hour period, which may indicate an approaching weather system that could alter current conditions. Wind speeds have been generally light and variable, with several hours of calm conditions, which is typical for San Francisco's microclimates and could lead to the accumulation of pollutants in the absence of stronger winds. Finally, wind directions have shifted throughout the day but have stayed predominantly gentle, which is unlikely to result in significant weather changes.
