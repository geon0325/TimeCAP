Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a gradual increase in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia relative to total deaths, starting at 5.36% and rising to 6.53%, surpassing the average ratio of 7.84%. The number of deaths attributed to Influenza has increased significantly from 8 to 83, while deaths from Pneumonia have also followed an upward trend from 2706 to 3493. The total number of deaths has experienced a steady climb, with the initial week at 50,609 and the last week at 54,760. This upward trend in both total deaths and those from Influenza or Pneumonia suggests a worsening impact of these illnesses on the population. Healthcare systems may need to allocate more resources to manage and prevent these diseases, particularly as the mortality ratio from these causes is rising closer to the overall average mortality ratio.
