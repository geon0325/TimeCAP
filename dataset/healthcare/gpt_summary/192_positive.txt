Over the past 20 weeks, the overall ratio of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza has fluctuated, with an average positivity rate of 6.26%, although the ratio of positive specimens experienced a peak at week 14 with a rate of 3.46%. The number of specimens tested has increased consistently from 11,400 to 24,630, indicating a heightened effort to monitor influenza activity. Influenza B has shown a notable surge in the last week, with a positivity rate jumping to 1.44% from previous weeks, and the number of positive specimens for Influenza B surpassing those for Influenza A, suggesting a shift in the dominant strain. The positivity rate for Influenza A peaked at week 4 with 1.46% but has since shown a decline, reaching a low of 0.66% at week 18, followed by a minor increase to 0.82% in the most recent week. These trends suggest a dynamic influenza season with potential implications for healthcare resource allocation, vaccination strategies, and public health interventions designed to manage the spread of both strains of influenza.
