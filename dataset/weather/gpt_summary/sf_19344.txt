Over the last 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a consistent trend of high humidity, with values frequently hitting full saturation. Air pressure has shown a gradual and steady increase throughout the period, indicating a strengthening high-pressure system that could be associated with settled weather conditions. Temperature has remained relatively stable with slight fluctuations, suggesting a lack of significant frontal activity or dramatic weather changes. Wind speeds have been moderate without any significant peaks, and wind direction has been variable, with a general trend of shifting from southerly to westerly directions. The combination of high humidity, increasing pressure, stable temperatures, and moderate winds suggest a period of calm weather, although the persistent high humidity could lead to fog development, particularly in coastal and low-lying areas.
