Over the past 20 weeks, the data indicates a fluctuating but overall increasing trend in the number of patients presenting with Influenza-like Illness (ILI) across all age groups. The youngest age group (0-4 years) has consistently shown the highest count of ILI cases, reflecting a potential vulnerability in this demographic. Interestingly, there has been a notable surge in ILI cases among school-aged children and young adults (5-24 years), which could imply increased transmission within educational institutions or group activities. Despite these increases, the ratio of ILI patients to the total number of patients has remained below the baseline threshold, suggesting that the healthcare system might not be currently overburdened by ILI cases. However, the upward trend in the ratio of ILI patients in recent weeks could signal an impending rise in demand for healthcare resources if the trend continues.
