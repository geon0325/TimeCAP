Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a significant fluctuation in the incidence of Influenza-like Illness (ILI), with a marked peak in the ratio of ILI patients that eventually declined to below the baseline level. The highest ratios were observed in the age group of 5-24 years, suggesting that school-age children and young adults were the most affected demographics during this period. This is followed by a notable decrease in ILI incidence across all age groups, with the most substantial drop in the youngest age group (0-4 years), potentially reflecting the combined effect of the end of the flu season and public health measures. The current ratio of ILI patients has fallen below the baseline, indicating a possible easing of the healthcare burden related to ILI. However, the healthcare system should remain vigilant for any signs of resurgence, especially in the most affected age groups, and maintain efforts in prevention and control measures to manage the spread of ILI.
