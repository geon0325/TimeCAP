Humidity levels have fluctuated significantly, with very high values during the early morning hours indicating possible morning fog or dew, followed by a decrease throughout the day which could suggest drier conditions. Atmospheric pressure has been slowly decreasing, which is often associated with the approach of a weather system that could lead to changing weather patterns or increased chances of precipitation. Wind speeds remained generally light with some variability in direction, indicating a lack of strong weather fronts or systems impacting the area. Overall, the wind direction has been predominantly from the south to southeast, which in Houston is typically associated with warm, moist air coming from the Gulf of Mexico, potentially contributing to the observed high humidity levels.
