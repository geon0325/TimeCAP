Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a steady prevalence of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) across all age groups, with the highest incidence observed in the age group of 25-49. Although the overall number of ILI cases has fluctuated, there has been a slight increase in the ratio of ILI patients in the most recent weeks, suggesting a potential uptick in ILI activity despite remaining below the baseline level for concern. The age groups 0-4 and 50-64 showed a notable increase in ILI cases towards the end of the 20-week period, which could indicate spreading infections among these demographics. However, the ratio of ILI patients has consistently stayed below the threshold of 2.9%, indicating that the ILI activity is within expected levels and has not reached a point that would typically signify an outbreak. It is important for healthcare providers to continue monitoring these trends closely, as an increase in ILI can lead to higher demand for healthcare services and could be an early indicator of a more widespread influenza outbreak.
