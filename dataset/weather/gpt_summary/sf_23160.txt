Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperature experienced minor fluctuations, generally remaining within a narrow range indicative of stable weather conditions. Humidity levels were high throughout the day, often reaching saturation, which could signal the presence of fog or low-lying clouds, particularly during the cooler early morning hours. Air pressure remained consistent, staying at a level that suggests settled weather without significant changes or disturbances. Wind speeds were mostly light to gentle and showed little variation, which is typical for San Francisco's coastal climate. The wind direction was predominantly from the southwest, which is a common pattern in this region, potentially bringing in moisture from the ocean and affecting local weather conditions.
