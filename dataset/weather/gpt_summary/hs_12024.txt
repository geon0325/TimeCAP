Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there was a gradual decrease in temperature that reached its lowest point during the early morning hours, followed by a steady increase as the day progressed. The humidity levels fluctuated, with a notable increase coinciding with the lowest temperatures, which suggests the presence of cooler and potentially damper early morning conditions.
