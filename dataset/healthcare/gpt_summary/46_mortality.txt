Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to total deaths, with a significant peak in weeks 7 and 8 where the ratios were 9.56% and 10.55%, respectively, substantially exceeding the 20-week average of 7.84%. This peak coincides with a sharp increase in deaths attributed to influenza, which surged from 92 to 1165 and then to 1536 deaths in weeks 6, 7, and 8, respectively. Although mortality from pneumonia also increased during this period, influenza appears to have been a key driver in the increased mortality ratio. Following this peak, there has been a general declining trend in the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia, reaching a low of 7.23% in the final week, suggesting a potential easing of the impact of these respiratory conditions on the overall mortality. However, the consistently higher ratio compared to the average across the 20-week period indicates a sustained burden on healthcare resources, warranting continued vigilance and resource allocation to manage these respiratory diseases.
