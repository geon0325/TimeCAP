Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a general decrease in the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the overall mortality, starting from a high of 7.75% in week 7 and ending at a low of 5.60% in week 20, which is below the average ratio of 7.84%. Despite fluctuations, the total number of deaths has remained relatively stable, with a slight decline from 58,137 in week 1 to 52,633 in week 20. Deaths from influenza have seen a significant decrease, from 327 in week 1 to just 16 in week 20. Pneumonia deaths also followed a downward trend, albeit less pronounced, from 3,893 in week 1 to 2,934 in week 20. These trends may indicate a reduction in the impact of respiratory infections on overall mortality or an improvement in the prevention and treatment of these conditions, suggesting positive implications for healthcare resource allocation and public health strategies.
