Over the last 24 hours in New York City, the temperature has generally remained stable with minor fluctuations, indicating a relatively constant weather pattern. Humidity levels have varied significantly, with periods of complete saturation suggesting the possibility of fog or mist formations, especially during the early hours. Air pressure was mostly steady in the initial hours but saw a noticeable increase, which could imply a transition to clearer conditions if the trend continues. Wind speeds were light to moderate but did experience a period of increased intensity, which could have dispersed any early fog or led to cooler wind chill effects. The wind direction has been variable but predominantly from the east to northeast, which is typical for the region and could have influenced the temperature and humidity stability observed.
