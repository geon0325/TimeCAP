Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has experienced a downward trend, decreasing from 4228.48 to 3873.33, signaling a potential increase in investor caution and a shift away from riskier assets. The VIX, commonly known as the "fear index," has risen from 20.60 to 26.30, which corroborates the increased market volatility and investor anxiety. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 have also reflected this negative sentiment, with the Nikkei 225 dropping from 28930.33 to 27567.65 and the FTSE 100 from 7550.40 to 7236.70, indicating a broader global market pullback.

Commodity prices have shown mixed signals, with Gold Futures slightly decreasing from 1747.60 to 1671.70, which can be perceived as investors' reduced demand for traditional safe-haven assets, while Crude Oil Futures have also seen a decline from 90.77 to 85.11, which may suggest a forecasted slowdown in economic activity. Currency markets have witnessed moderate fluctuations with the EUR/USD pair moving in a narrow range around parity and the USD strengthening against the JPY and CNY, moving from 135.79 to 143.37 against JPY and from 6.78 to 6.99 against CNY, reflecting a stronger dollar environment which could impact international trade dynamics and emerging market economies negatively.
