Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a rising trend in Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases across all age groups, with a significant increase in the proportion of ILI patients, which has surpassed the benchmark severity threshold of 2.9% from week 8 onwards. The highest ILI incidence proportion was observed in weeks 16 and 17, reaching 6.31% and 6.90%, respectively, suggesting a peak in ILI activity during this period. The age group of 5-24 years consistently showed the highest number of ILI cases, with a notable spike in weeks 15 through 17, coinciding with the overall peak in ILI percentages. Since week 18, there has been a decline in ILI cases across all age groups, although the proportion of ILI patients remains above the severity threshold, indicating that the ILI activity is still at a significant level. This sustained increase in ILI cases, particularly in the younger population, could strain healthcare resources and highlights the need for ongoing public health surveillance and preventative measures.
