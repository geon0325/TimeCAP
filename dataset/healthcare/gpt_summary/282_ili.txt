The analysis of the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data over the last 20 weeks reveals a progressive increase in the number of ILI cases across all age groups, with the most significant rises observed among younger patients, particularly those aged 0-4 and 5-24. Despite the uptick in cases, the overall ratio of ILI patients remained well below the baseline threshold of 2.9%, indicating that the situation has not reached levels typically associated with an influenza epidemic. The highest ratios of ILI patients were reported in the weeks when the number of patients aged 25-49 and 5-24 were at their peaks, suggesting that these age groups may be driving the overall ILI trends. It is noteworthy that while there was an increase in ILI cases among older age groups (50-64 and 65 or more), the ratio of ILI patients did not exceed the baseline, which could be due to higher overall patient numbers or possibly higher vaccination rates in these age groups. Healthcare providers should monitor these trends closely, as increasing ILI activity, even below the epidemic threshold, can strain healthcare resources and may be indicative of an impending escalation that could require a coordinated response.
