The analysis of the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data over the past 20 weeks reveals a steady increase in the ratio of ILI patients, with the most recent weeks showing values above the baseline of 2.9%. The significant rise in patient numbers across all age groups, particularly in the youngest (0-4 years) and school-age (5-24 years) cohorts, suggests a growing spread of ILI. Despite the overall increase in ILI cases, the oldest age group (65 or more) maintained the lowest counts, although these also trended upwards towards the end of the analyzed period. The substantial spike in the total number of patients in the most recent week indicates a possible surge in ILI activity, which could place additional strain on healthcare resources. Healthcare providers and systems should prepare for increased demand for medical care and consider public health interventions to mitigate the spread of ILI.
