Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable decline in the mortality ratio from influenza or pneumonia relative to total deaths, dropping from 7.36% to 5.30%, which is below the average ratio of 7.84%. Despite fluctuations, the total number of deaths showed a slight decreasing trend, with the initial count of 62,729 reducing to 56,273 by the end of the period. Deaths attributed to pneumonia also exhibited a downward trend, decreasing from 4,474 to 2,953, while deaths from influenza remained relatively low but showed a minor decrease from 145 to 29. The consistent decrease in the ratio of mortality from influenza or pneumonia suggests an improvement in the management or severity of these conditions during the observed period. However, the persistent presence of these illnesses highlights the ongoing need for vigilance in public health measures and clinical care to manage and prevent these respiratory diseases.
