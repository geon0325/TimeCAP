Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the rate of positive influenza specimens, peaking at 26.27% in week 10 before declining to 1.37% by week 20. The majority of positive cases have consistently been attributed to Influenza A, which saw a sharp increase to a peak of 25.70% in week 9, followed by a decline mirroring the overall positivity rate. Influenza B has remained a smaller proportion of the positive cases, but its positivity rate has been slowly increasing, reaching a peak of 0.27% in the final week. The highest number of specimens tested coincided with the highest positivity rates, suggesting a possible correlation between increased testing and detection of cases. The observed trends indicate a potential easing of the influenza spread in recent weeks, which could decrease the burden on healthcare resources but warrants continued monitoring for possible variations in the pattern.
