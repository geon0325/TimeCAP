Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with a marked downtrend early on, followed by a recovery and closing slightly higher than its starting point, suggesting a cautious optimism in the market. Conversely, the VIX, which measures market volatility, has generally trended downwards, indicating a reduction in investor fear and market uncertainty. The Nikkei 225 exhibited a significant recovery, especially in the latter days, possibly reflecting positive sentiment in the Asian markets. In commodities, Gold Futures displayed a slight overall increase, reflecting its status as a safe-haven asset amid market fluctuations, whereas Crude Oil Futures saw a pronounced uptrend, which could signal increasing energy costs and contribute to inflationary pressures. Exchange rates revealed a weakening of the USD against the JPY, potentially signaling shifts in risk appetite or changes in monetary policy expectations, while the USD/CNY pair remained relatively stable, suggesting a steady outlook in trade relations between the United States and China.
