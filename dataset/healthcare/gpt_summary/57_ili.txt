The data indicates a spike in the ratio of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) patients surpassing the baseline threshold during the early weeks of the examined period, followed by a gradual decline in subsequent weeks, eventually falling below the baseline. Notably, the ILI incidence peaked in the age group 5-24, which may reflect higher transmission rates within school and college settings. This was subsequently followed by a marked decrease across all age groups, suggesting a possible waning of the ILI season or effective public health interventions. The consistent decline in ILI ratios in recent weeks could alleviate pressures on healthcare resources, but continued surveillance is necessary to monitor for potential resurgences, especially in vulnerable age groups such as the youngest (0-4) and the elderly (65 or more). Considering the historical impact of ILI on healthcare systems, the current trends are positive, but healthcare providers should remain vigilant and prepared for any changes in the pattern.
