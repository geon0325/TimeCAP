Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have remained relatively stable, experiencing only minor fluctuations around a moderate range, indicative of steady weather without significant warm or cold shifts. Humidity levels have been consistently at saturation, suggesting a high likelihood of fog or mist, particularly in coastal and low-lying areas, which is common for this locale. Air pressure has been gradually increasing throughout the period, pointing to stable weather conditions and potentially clearer skies following any dissipating fog. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with no significant gusts, providing a gentle breeze that would not contribute substantially to wind chill or rapid weather changes. The wind direction has shown a gradual shift from south-southeast to east-northeast, which may influence localized weather patterns, such as the movement of coastal fog.
