The data over the last 20 weeks indicates an upward trend in the percentage of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) patients, surpassing the baseline of 2.9% in recent weeks, pointing to a growing prevalence of ILI within the population. This increase is most pronounced in the 5-24 age group, which could suggest higher transmission rates in settings such as schools or colleges. The consistent rise in ILI cases across all age groups, but especially among the economically active population (ages 25-49), might lead to increased absenteeism from work and could strain healthcare resources due to higher demand for medical care. The elderly population (age 65 or more), while not showing the highest increase, remains a concern due to their vulnerability to complications from ILI. As the percentage of ILI patients has now exceeded the established baseline for multiple consecutive weeks, public health interventions and increased healthcare preparedness may be required to mitigate the impact on the community and healthcare systems.
