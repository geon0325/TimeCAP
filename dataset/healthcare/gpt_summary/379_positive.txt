Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable decline in the ratio of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the initial average ratio of 6.26% decreasing to a low of 0.92% in week 8. This decline was primarily driven by a reduction in Influenza A positive specimens, which dropped from a high of 4.44% to 0.36% by week 18. However, there has been a slight uptick in the latter weeks, with the positive ratio for Influenza A rising to 0.51% and the overall positivity ratio reaching 1.19% by week 20. In contrast, Influenza B has shown a less consistent pattern, with an initial decrease followed by an increase to a peak positivity ratio of 0.78% in week 19 before a slight decrease to 0.68% in week 20. These fluctuations in influenza activity are important for healthcare providers to monitor and respond to, as they may influence the allocation of resources for testing, vaccination, and treatment efforts in the upcoming weeks.
