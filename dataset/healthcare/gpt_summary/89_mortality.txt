Over the past 20 weeks, the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia to total deaths has shown a general upward trend, exceeding the average ratio of 7.84% in recent weeks, with a peak of 8.33% in week 15. There was a significant spike in deaths from influenza between weeks 14 and 16, with the highest count of 671 deaths in week 15, which is notably higher than the counts in the preceding weeks. Pneumonia deaths have also increased, with a gradual rise from 2819 in week 1 to 3893 in week 20. This rise in mortality rates from these respiratory conditions could indicate a worsening trend in public health related to these diseases. The data suggests a potential strain on healthcare resources and highlights the need for close monitoring and possibly increased preventive measures, such as vaccination and public health campaigns to mitigate the impact.
