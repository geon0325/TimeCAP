Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, transitioning from relatively cooler conditions to a warmer environment. Simultaneously, there has been a notable decrease in humidity, suggesting a shift from potentially damp and misty conditions to drier air throughout the day. Air pressure has shown a slight decreasing trend, which could be indicative of changing weather patterns, possibly leading to increased cloudiness or precipitation chances in the near future. Wind speeds have been generally light to moderate, with some variability, but without any significant gusts that would impact the city's activities. The wind direction has shifted from northerly to southerly and then to a more southwesterly direction, which may have contributed to the warmer temperatures observed as warmer air from the south was drawn into the area.
