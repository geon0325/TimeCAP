Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual decline in temperature moving from warmer conditions to cooler temperatures at night, before a noticeable uptick during the daytime, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels have shown an inverse relationship with temperature, increasing as the temperatures dropped overnight and then fluctuating in the latter part of the period. Air pressure has been relatively stable but showed a slight downward trend, suggesting a potential change in weather patterns or the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with calm conditions in the early hours, and a gradual increase through the day, which could influence the dispersal of any atmospheric particulate or pollutants. The wind direction varied, with a general preference for southerly to south-easterly directions, possibly bringing in moisture from the Gulf, impacting local humidity and precipitation patterns.
