Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have shown a diurnal variation with the warmest conditions during the afternoon hours and a notable cooling trend post-sunset leading into the early morning. Humidity levels have fluctuated significantly, with relatively lower humidity during the daytime, increasing substantially towards the night and early morning, suggesting the possibility of morning fog typical of the San Francisco area. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase observed mid-series, which could be indicative of a transient high-pressure system affecting the area.

The combination of steady air pressure, light winds, and varying humidity could lead to calm but potentially foggy morning conditions, typical of San Francisco's microclimate.
