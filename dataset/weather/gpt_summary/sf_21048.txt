Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have experienced a slight fluctuation, starting off cooler in the early hours, warming up towards the middle of the day, then cooling down again towards the evening. Humidity levels were quite high throughout, reaching saturation at times, which could have led to foggy conditions, particularly when combined with the relatively stable high atmospheric pressure. The air pressure showed a slight decreasing trend, which may indicate an approaching weather system with the potential to change current conditions. Wind speeds were generally light and variable, which is typical for San Francisco's microclimate, and without strong winds, any fog or low clouds might persist longer. The wind direction has been predominantly from the west-northwest, which is common for coastal areas in this region and can contribute to cooler conditions due to the influence of the ocean.
