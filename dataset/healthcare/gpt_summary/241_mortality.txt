Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable increase in the proportion of deaths due to Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, with the ratio growing from 16% to 18.51%, which is significantly higher than the average ratio of 7.84%. This upward trend is worrisome and suggests a worsening impact of these respiratory conditions on public health. The total number of deaths has also increased in the latter part of the 20-week period, reaching a peak of 86,858 in the final week. The absolute number of deaths attributed to pneumonia has risen sharply, almost tripling from 4,829 to 16,037, while deaths from influenza have shown a smaller but consistent increase. This pattern indicates a potential strain on healthcare resources and highlights the need for increased preventive measures, especially for vulnerable populations at greater risk for severe outcomes from these illnesses.
