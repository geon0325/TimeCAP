Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, starting from just below freezing and warming up to mild conditions. Concurrently, humidity levels showed significant variation, with noticeable spikes possibly indicating the presence of moisture-laden air masses passing through the region. Air pressure demonstrated a slight declining trend overall, suggesting a weakening of the previous high-pressure system that could lead to changing weather patterns or increased chances of precipitation. Wind speeds were mostly gentle to moderate throughout the day, with an increase observed later in the period, which could contribute to wind chill effects, especially when combined with the cooler temperatures of the earlier hours. The wind direction was predominantly westerly, with a notable shift toward the north-west in the final hours, potentially ushering in a different air mass that could affect the local weather.
