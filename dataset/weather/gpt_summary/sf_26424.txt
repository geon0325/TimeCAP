Over the past day in San Francisco, there was a notable increase in temperature reaching a peak in the late afternoon before a gradual decline towards the evening. Relative humidity levels showed minor fluctuations but generally trended downward as the temperature rose, suggesting an inverse relationship between temperature and humidity throughout the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable but experienced a significant drop later in the day, which could indicate the approach of a weather front or system. Wind speeds varied, with some gustier conditions in the early hours that calmed significantly towards the middle of the day, and a modest increase later on. The wind direction was predominantly from the west and northwest, with some variability, which is typical for coastal San Francisco influenced by maritime breezes.
