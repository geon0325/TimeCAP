Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable increase in the proportion of deaths attributed to influenza and pneumonia, exceeding the 20-week average of 7.84% in the final week with a mortality ratio of 7.75%. The total number of deaths fluctuated, reaching a peak in week 9 (61090 deaths), while the number of deaths from influenza and pneumonia showed an upward trend, with influenza-related deaths escalating significantly from 36 in the first week to 511 in the last. The highest ratio of mortality from these conditions within the 20-week period was observed in week 9 at 8.33%, coinciding with the peak in overall deaths. The data suggest an increasing burden of influenza and pneumonia on the healthcare system, with a stark rise in influenza deaths by over 1300% from week 1 to week 20. This trend may indicate a need for enhanced preventive measures and healthcare resource allocation to manage the impact of respiratory infections.
