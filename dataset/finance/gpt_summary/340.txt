Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a general upward trend, closing at 3193.93 from an initial 2929.80, suggesting a positive sentiment among investors. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, has decreased from 27.98 to 24.52, indicating increased market stability and reduced investor fear. Meanwhile, international indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have also followed an upward trajectory, with the Nikkei 225 rising from 20179.09 to 22863.73 and the FTSE 100 from 5936.00 to 6484.30, reflecting a global risk-on environment. Gold futures have seen some volatility but ended the period with a notable decline to 1676.20, which may suggest a shift in investor preference towards more risk-oriented assets. Lastly, the strengthening of the EUR/USD exchange rate from 1.08 to 1.13, alongside a slight uptick in USD/JPY from 106.36 to 109.15, could be indicative of a weakening US dollar amidst global economic recovery sentiments.
