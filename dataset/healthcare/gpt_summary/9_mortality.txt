Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable decline in the percentage of deaths attributed to influenza or pneumonia relative to the total number of deaths, with the initial ratio of 8.17% decreasing to 5.52%. This trend suggests an improvement in the management and/or prevention of these respiratory diseases. Despite fluctuations, the total number of deaths has also shown a slight downward trend, from 57,477 to 50,127. However, the number of deaths specifically from influenza has seen a steep decline, from 472 to 10, which could be indicative of successful influenza vaccination campaigns or lower viral transmission rates. Pneumonia deaths have also decreased but more gradually, from 4,223 to 2,755, which may reflect improvements in healthcare interventions, such as antibiotic treatment or better access to medical care.
