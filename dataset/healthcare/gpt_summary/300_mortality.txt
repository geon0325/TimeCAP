Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a general decline in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, starting at 14.15% and ending at 6.85%, which is below the average ratio of 7.84%. The absolute number of deaths from both Influenza and Pneumonia initially decreased but then spiked, with Influenza deaths peaking dramatically in week 14 at 887 deaths. This peak in Influenza mortality coincided with a decrease in the number of deaths from Pneumonia, suggesting a possible shift in the prevalence or reporting between the two conditions. Despite the overall downward trend in the ratio, the total number of deaths fluctuated, with a notable increase in weeks 9 through 13, before decreasing again. This data indicates a potential easing of the burden of Influenza and Pneumonia on the healthcare system, but the sudden spike in Influenza deaths warrants further investigation to understand its cause and to prevent potential future outbreaks.
