Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a fluctuating trend in the mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia with respect to the total number of deaths. The peak ratio of mortality from these diseases was witnessed in weeks 7 and 8, with a value exceeding 10.5%, which is significantly higher than the 20-week average of 7.84%. However, there has been a noticeable decline in recent weeks, with the ratio dropping to as low as 5.20% in week 16 and slightly increasing to 5.47% in week 20. Despite the decrease in the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia, the absolute number of deaths from these illnesses remains substantial, indicating an ongoing challenge for the healthcare system. This trend may suggest an improvement in the management of these diseases or seasonal variations, but continued vigilance and resource allocation in healthcare settings are essential to address potential surges and maintain public health.
