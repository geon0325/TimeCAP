Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable decline in the percentage of deaths attributed to Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, with the ratio starting at 7.63% and ending at 5.39%, demonstrating a downward trend well below the average ratio of 7.84%. The absolute number of deaths from both Influenza and Pneumonia has also decreased, with Influenza-related deaths dropping significantly from 444 to just 12, and Pneumonia-related deaths reducing from 3853 to 2700. The overall total number of deaths has shown fluctuations but presents a slight decreasing trend over the period, from an initial 56326 to 50274 in the final week reviewed. This trend suggests an improvement in the management and prevention of these respiratory conditions or a seasonal decline in cases, which could result in a lowered burden on the healthcare system. However, continued monitoring is essential to assess whether this trend will be sustained and to prepare for potential future increases that could strain healthcare resources.
