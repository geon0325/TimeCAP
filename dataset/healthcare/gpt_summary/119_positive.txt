Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable decrease in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the initial positivity ratio of 27.03% dropping to 1.53% by the final week. The number of specimens tested has also declined over this period, starting at 69,124 and ending at 10,789, which may suggest a reduction in suspected influenza cases or a change in testing strategies. Influenza A has shown a consistent decrease in positivity from 21.38% to 0.70%, while Influenza B has similarly decreased from 5.65% to 0.82%. This downward trend reflects a significant reduction in influenza activity, which could indicate the end of the influenza season or effective public health interventions. The decreasing burden of influenza may alleviate the strain on healthcare resources, allowing for the reallocation of efforts to other areas or the recovery of the system from the heightened demands of the flu season.
