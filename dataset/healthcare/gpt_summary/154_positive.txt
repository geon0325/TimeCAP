Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant increase in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the overall positive ratio rising from 1.70% to 22.55%. This upward trend is primarily driven by a steep rise in Influenza A detections, which escalated from 1.20% to 21.95%, while Influenza B also increased but to a lesser extent, from 0.50% to 0.60%. The week-over-week data shows a worrying surge in infections, peaking in the most recent week with nearly one in four specimens testing positive. Such a rapid increase in influenza cases could strain healthcare resources, necessitating preparedness in medical facilities, potential adjustments in public health policies, and increased influenza vaccination efforts. The data indicates a need for heightened vigilance and response from public health authorities to manage the growing impact of influenza on the community.
