Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a moderate fluctuation in temperature, starting and ending the period on a warmer note with a noticeable dip in the early morning hours. Humidity levels peaked during the night but have since shown a declining trend towards the end of the period, indicating drier conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight decrease, which suggests a possibility of changing weather patterns or the approach of a weak weather system. Wind speed varied, with calmer winds in the early morning followed by an increase later in the day, which could contribute to the dispersion of humidity and influence local weather conditions. Predominantly southerly wind directions dominated the period, consistent with warm air being drawn up from the Gulf of Mexico, which may have contributed to the warmer temperatures observed.
