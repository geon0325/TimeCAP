Over the last 24 hours, New York City experienced a slight increase in temperature during the daytime, indicating a typical diurnal warming pattern, followed by a gradual cooling trend as the evening approached. Humidity levels were consistently high throughout the period, which could have contributed to a muggy feeling in the air, particularly when temperatures peaked. Air pressure showed a steady decline, suggesting a possible change in weather patterns or the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds were generally light but picked up significantly towards the end of the period, which might lead to cooler conditions if sustained. The wind direction varied, mostly coming from the west to northwest, which is common for this region and could bring clearer conditions if associated with a high-pressure system.
