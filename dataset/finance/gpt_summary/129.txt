Concurrently, the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 both experienced declines towards the end of the period, with the Nikkei 225 seeing a significant drop on the 19th day and the FTSE 100 ending notably lower, suggesting a bearish sentiment across major global equity markets.

Crude oil futures fluctuated but ended on a downward trajectory, potentially reflecting concerns over global economic growth. The foreign exchange rates saw the USD strengthening against the JPY but weakening against the CNY, with the EUR/USD remaining relatively steady, suggesting nuanced shifts in currency markets that may be driven by regional economic factors and trade dynamics.
