Over the past 24 hours in New York City, the temperature has shown remarkable stability before rising slightly towards the latter part of the period. However, there has been a noticeable drop in humidity levels, which, combined with the temperature increase, could suggest a shift towards drier and warmer conditions. Air pressure experienced a gradual increase, indicating potential changes in the weather pattern, such as the onset of more stable weather conditions. Wind speeds have been relatively calm and decreased even further, suggesting a period of less wind-driven activity. The wind direction has remained predominantly westerly with a slight shift to the northwest later on, which could bring cooler air from those directions.
