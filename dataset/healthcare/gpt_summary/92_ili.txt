The time-series data for Influenza-like Illness (ILI) over the last 20 weeks indicates an upward trend in the ratio of ILI patients, with the ratio consistently surpassing the baseline of 2.9% in the latter half of the observed period. This suggests a growing incidence of ILI, which may place increased pressure on healthcare resources due to higher demand for medical attention. Notably, the age group 5-24 has seen a significant increase, potentially reflecting higher transmission rates in schools or among young adults. The continued increase in ILI rates among older age groups, particularly those aged 65 or more, is concerning due to the higher risks of complications in this demographic. Strategic planning for potential surges in healthcare utilization should be considered, including vaccination promotion, resource allocation, and public health interventions to mitigate the spread of ILI.
