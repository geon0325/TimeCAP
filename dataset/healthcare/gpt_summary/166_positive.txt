Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant fluctuation in the positivity rate for influenza, with the ratio of positive specimens peaking at 26.24% in week 11, followed by a decline to 5.84% by week 20. Influenza A has been the predominant strain, reaching a high of 25.36% positivity in week 11, but decreasing to 4.17% by the end of the period. In contrast, Influenza B showed a lower incidence, with its peak ratio of positive specimens at 1.85% in week 19, indicating a delayed seasonal pattern compared to Influenza A. The overall decline in influenza positivity rates suggests a downward trend in flu activity, which could lead to reduced healthcare system burden in the upcoming weeks. However, the healthcare system should remain vigilant for potential fluctuations and maintain resources for testing and treatment, especially considering the late season increase in Influenza B activity.
