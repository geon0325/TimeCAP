Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a fluctuating trend in the number of patients presenting with Influenza-like Illness (ILI), with a noticeable peak in the age group 5-24, suggesting possible seasonal variations or outbreaks that particularly affect school-aged children and young adults. The ratio of ILI patients has crossed the baseline threshold of 2.9% in recent weeks, indicating a significant increase in ILI activity that could strain healthcare resources and necessitate increased vigilance in disease surveillance and control measures. While the oldest age group (65 or more) consistently reported the fewest ILI cases, there was a period where the ILI ratio exceeded the baseline, which is concerning given the vulnerability of this age group to complications from influenza. The recent downtrend in the ILI ratio across all age groups may signal a decline in ILI activity, but continuous monitoring is essential to confirm this trend and to prepare for potential future surges. Healthcare providers should be prepared for a potential increase in demand for medical services and consider strategies to prevent and control the spread of ILI, including vaccination and public education campaigns.
