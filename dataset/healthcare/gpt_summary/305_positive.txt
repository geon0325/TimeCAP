The data indicates a significant increase in the proportion of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza over the last 20 weeks, with a notable uptick in cases from Week 13 onwards. The average positivity rate of 6.26% is surpassed from Week 18, peaking at 6.23% in Week 19 before a slight decrease to 5.77% in Week 20, suggesting a possible leveling off. Influenza A has been the predominant strain, with its positivity rate escalating dramatically from 0.02% in Week 1 to 5.71% in Week 20, accounting for the majority of the increase in overall influenza cases. Influenza B has remained a smaller proportion of the total cases, showing a less pronounced but steady increase from 0.03% in Week 1 to 0.06% in Week 20. This rising trend in influenza cases, especially of the A strain, could potentially strain healthcare resources and necessitates continued surveillance and potentially increased healthcare preparedness for addressing the influx of flu patients.
