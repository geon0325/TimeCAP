Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable gradual decrease in temperature, which is typical during the transition from day to night, followed by a slight increase as daytime approaches. Relative humidity levels have been high but showed a decreasing trend, which could lead to a feeling of less mugginess in the air as time progresses. Air pressure has consistently risen throughout the period, suggesting the presence of a high-pressure system which is usually associated with stable and clearer weather conditions. Wind speeds have been moderate and fairly consistent, with no significant fluctuations that would indicate stormy conditions. The wind direction has generally been from the north to northwest, which could be contributing to the cooler temperatures observed, as these winds often bring cooler air from those directions.
