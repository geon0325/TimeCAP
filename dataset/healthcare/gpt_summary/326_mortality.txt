Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia to the total number of deaths has consistently remained below the average ratio of 7.84%, indicating a lower relative impact of these illnesses compared to historical data. The highest observed weekly mortality ratio was 6.43% in week 3, while the lowest was 5.00% in week 16, showing some fluctuation but generally a downward trend in the relative impact of these causes of death. The absolute numbers of deaths from Influenza have decreased over the period, with a notable drop from 46 deaths in week 1 to 22 deaths in week 20, suggesting a possible reduction in Influenza-related mortality. Pneumonia-related deaths also decreased but showed slight increases in certain weeks, such as weeks 19 and 20, which could indicate variability in the incidence or reporting of Pneumonia. These trends could potentially signal an improvement in the management of Influenza and Pneumonia, but continuous monitoring is essential to understand the long-term implications for the healthcare system.
