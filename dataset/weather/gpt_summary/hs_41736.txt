Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have exhibited a typical diurnal pattern, starting off warm in the early hours, cooling slightly towards the morning, and then rising again towards midday and into the afternoon. Humidity levels have seen significant fluctuations, with notably high levels during the early morning hours, which could be indicative of fog or dew formation, and a general decrease through the day, suggesting drier air moving into the area. Air pressure has remained relatively stable with a slight increase towards the afternoon, which is often associated with fair weather conditions. Wind speeds have been mostly light to gentle breezes, with a slight increase in the evening, which could contribute to a more comfortable perceived temperature by aiding in the dispersal of humidity. The wind direction has been variable but predominantly from the south to south-east, which in this region is typically associated with warmer and more humid air being drawn inland from the Gulf of Mexico.
