Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a downward trend, dropping from 3357.75 to 2882.23, indicating increased market uncertainty and potential investor concerns about economic prospects. The VIX, or Volatility Index, has surged from 15.18 to 47.30, reflecting heightened market volatility and risk aversion among investors. International markets have mirrored this sentiment, with Japan's Nikkei 225 and the UK's FTSE 100 both experiencing significant declines, suggesting a global apprehension towards equities. Commodity markets have also reacted, with Gold Futures rising initially but slightly retracting as investors flock to safe-haven assets, whereas Crude Oil Futures have plummeted from 49.94 to 34.36, likely due to both demand fears and the recent price war between major oil-producing countries. Currency markets have seen the US dollar weakening against the Yen and Euro, moving from 109.77 to 103.11 and 1.09 to 1.14 respectively, which could indicate a flight to safety and potential concerns over the US economic outlook in the face of international headwinds.
