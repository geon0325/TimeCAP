Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced relatively stable temperatures with a slight cooling trend. Humidity levels began high but showed significant fluctuations throughout the period, reaching notably lower values in the later hours, indicating less moisture in the air. Air pressure showed an increasing trend, suggesting a high-pressure system could be moving into the area, which is often associated with more stable weather conditions. Wind speeds were mostly gentle to moderate but did see periods of increased intensity, possibly contributing to the dispersal of humidity. Wind direction was predominantly from the west, with some variability, which is typical for the region and could have influenced temperature stability and humidity levels.
