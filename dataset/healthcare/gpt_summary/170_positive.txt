Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable trend in respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the percentage of positive specimens peaking at 26.24% in week 7 and subsequently declining to 3.42% by week 20. The majority of positive cases were attributed to Influenza A, which at its height constituted 25.36% of the tested specimens, but showed a marked decrease to 1.76% by the end of the observed period. In contrast, Influenza B maintained a relatively lower and more stable presence, never exceeding 1.79% of the tested specimens. This downward trend in influenza cases suggests a waning of the flu season, which could potentially lead to a reduction in the strain on healthcare resources dedicated to managing influenza-related illnesses. However, the persistent presence of Influenza B cases, albeit small, indicates a need for continued surveillance and vaccination efforts to manage and prevent outbreaks.
