Over the past 20 weeks, the data indicates a fluctuating trend in the number of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases among different age groups, with the most significant incidence observed in the 25-49 age group. Despite an initial increase in ILI cases across all age groups, there has been a general decline in recent weeks, with the most pronounced reduction in the 50-64 and 65 or more age groups. Notably, the ratio of ILI patients has remained below the baseline of 2.9% throughout the period, suggesting that the ILI incidence is within expected levels and has not reached epidemic proportions. The youngest age group (0-4) experienced a moderate increase in ILI cases, underscoring the need for continued vigilance in monitoring this demographic. Overall, the healthcare system should be prepared for potential fluctuations in ILI cases but currently does not face an immediate strain from ILI-related demand.
