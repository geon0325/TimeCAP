Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable uptick in the number of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the total ratio of positive specimens increasing from 0.92% to 3.93%, exceeding the observed average of 6.26%. The data indicates a more pronounced increase in Influenza A positivity, which surged from a 0.73% ratio to a peak of 3.62%, while Influenza B also showed an increase but remained less prevalent with a rise from 0.19% to 0.31%. The highest overall positivity rate was recorded in the most recent week at 3.93%, suggesting a potential uptrend in influenza activity. This increase in influenza cases could put additional pressure on healthcare resources, potentially exacerbating the burden on facilities already dealing with other seasonal illnesses and ongoing health issues. Public health interventions and increased influenza vaccination efforts may be necessary to mitigate the impact of this rising trend in influenza infections.
