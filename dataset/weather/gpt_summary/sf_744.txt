Over the last 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperature exhibited a mild fluctuation, indicative of stable weather conditions with a slight warming trend observed towards the latter part of the day. Humidity levels remained high throughout most of the period, suggesting a potential for fog or mist, especially during the early morning or night when temperatures were lower, but a significant drop was noted at one point, which could have briefly influenced the comfort level. Air pressure was remarkably consistent, staying within a narrow range that points to a period of settled weather without significant fronts or storms passing through the area. Wind speeds varied from calm to moderate breezes, with a period of calm winds in the middle of the day, which could have led to a build-up of pollution or a sense of stuffiness. The wind direction shifted notably throughout the day, starting from a southerly direction, becoming variable with a calm period, and then turning to a more westerly flow, which is typical for coastal San Francisco and can influence marine conditions and fog dispersal.
