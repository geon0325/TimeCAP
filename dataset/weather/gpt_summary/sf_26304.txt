Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a noticeable decline in temperature followed by a moderate rebound during the day, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, with higher values during the cooler early hours which is common as cooler air holds less moisture, causing relative humidity to increase. Air pressure experienced a gradual decline throughout the period, potentially signaling an approaching weather system that could result in unstable weather conditions. Wind speed varied considerably, with a sharp increase towards the end of the period, suggesting the possible onset of a windier and potentially more turbulent weather pattern. Wind directions have been predominantly variable with a slight preference for westerly and northerly directions, which is typical for the region and can influence the temperature and fog patterns in the area.
