Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in the ratio of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the overall percentage peaking at 1.31% in week 4 and hitting a low of 0.70% in week 18 before slightly increasing again. The number of specimens tested has consistently risen, with a significant increase observed from week 15 to week 20, indicating a possible surge in suspected influenza cases or enhanced surveillance efforts. Influenza A has shown an increasing trend in positivity rate, growing from 0.36% in week 1 to 0.56% in week 20, suggesting a possible uptick in Influenza A activity. Conversely, Influenza B demonstrated a higher positivity rate in the initial weeks, particularly in week 2 at 0.78%, but then gradually decreased to a low of 0.22% in week 17 before rising again to 0.35% in week 20. These trends indicate a dynamic pattern of influenza circulation, with a recent increase in Influenza A cases that could strain the healthcare system if the trend continues, emphasizing the need for continued surveillance and possibly increased vaccination and public health measures.
