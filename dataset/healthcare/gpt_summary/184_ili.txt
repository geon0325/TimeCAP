The analysis of the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data over the last 20 weeks reveals a steady increase in the percentage of ILI patients across all age groups, with the highest jump observed in the youngest cohort (age 0-4), followed by school-age children and young adults (age 5-24). The increase in ILI patient ratios has been consistent, rising from well below the baseline to approaching and surpassing the threshold in recent weeks, indicating a potential uptick in influenza activity. Although the elderly population (age 65 or more) showed the lowest number of ILI cases, the consistent presence of ILI in this age group is concerning due to their higher vulnerability to complications. The healthcare system may experience increased strain as ILI ratios have crossed the baseline, signaling a need for enhanced preparedness in terms of resources, including staff and medical supplies. Public health interventions and influenza vaccination campaigns may need to be reinforced to mitigate the spread and impact of influenza, especially in the most affected age groups.
