Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia as a percentage of total deaths has shown significant variability, initially hovering slightly below the 20-week average of 7.84% but notably peaking at 19.37% and 19.40% in week 15 and 16, respectively. This peak correlates with a substantial increase in the total number of deaths for those weeks, suggesting a potential outbreak or heightened seasonal activity. After this peak, there has been a steady decline in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia, falling to 14.32% by week 20, which is still above the average ratio but indicates a possible easing of the impact on the healthcare system. The number of deaths attributed specifically to influenza remains relatively low in comparison to pneumonia, which consistently accounts for the majority of the combined mortality. The healthcare system may need to investigate the causes of the mid-period spike and prepare for potential future surges, while also continuing to address the consistently higher burden of pneumonia-related deaths.
