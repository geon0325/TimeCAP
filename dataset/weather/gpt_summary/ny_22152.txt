Over the past 24 hours in New York City, temperatures have shown a gradual increase, indicating a warming trend that progressed from cooler conditions in the early hours to warmer temperatures by the end of the period. Humidity levels fluctuated moderately throughout the day, starting higher in the early hours, decreasing to lower values during the day, and then slightly increasing again towards the end of the period. Air pressure experienced a slow and steady decrease, suggesting a potential change in the weather pattern that could lead to less stable conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, but there was an observable increase towards the latter part of the time period, which could contribute to a perceived drop in temperature due to wind chill. The wind direction was predominantly from the south to south-east, which may have influenced the gradual warming trend observed in the temperature data.
