The analysis of the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data over the last 20 weeks indicates a downward trend in the ratio of ILI patients across all age groups. Initially, the ratio of ILI patients was above the baseline, indicating a heightened level of influenza activity, but it has since fallen below the baseline, suggesting a decrease in ILI prevalence. The largest decrease was observed in the youngest age group (0-4 years), which could imply a significant reduction in ILI transmission among children, potentially due to seasonal changes, public health interventions, or natural disease progression. While the current ratio of ILI patients is below the threshold for elevated influenza activity, healthcare systems should remain vigilant as ILI can have significant impacts on vulnerable populations, especially the elderly. Continuous monitoring and preventive measures, such as vaccination and public education, remain critical to mitigating the spread of ILI and preparing for potential future increases.
