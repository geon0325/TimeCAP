Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 experienced volatility with a general upward trend, closing higher at 3806.80 from an initial 3588.84, indicating a possible recovery in investor confidence. The VIX, or Volatility Index, showed a slight decrease from 33.63 to 24.35, suggesting that market volatility has somewhat subsided, which typically corresponds with increased market stability. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 both exhibited an overall increase, ending the period higher, which could indicate strengthening in the international markets, particularly in Japan and the UK. Gold futures saw some fluctuations but ended slightly lower at 1676.50 compared to the beginning price of 1678.70, reflecting a possible shift in investor preference toward riskier assets as market conditions stabilized. Finally, currency exchange rates indicated a slight weakening of the US dollar against the Euro and Japanese Yen but strengthened against the Chinese Yuan, which may influence international trade dynamics and cross-border investment flows.
