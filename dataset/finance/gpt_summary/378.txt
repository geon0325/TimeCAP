Over the past 20 market days, the S&P 500 has exhibited mild volatility with a general upward trend, closing higher at 3246.22 from an initial 3130.01, suggesting a cautiously optimistic stock market sentiment. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, remained elevated but trended downwards from 27.68 to 24.76, reinforcing this sentiment. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 showed mixed performances with the Nikkei displaying modest gains while the FTSE ended significantly lower, reflecting geographical disparities in market conditions. Commodities such as Gold Futures increased in value from 1784.00 to 1942.30, indicating a flight to safety among investors amidst ongoing uncertainties, while Crude Oil Futures fluctuated but ended slightly lower, which may relate to concerns over global demand. Currency markets saw the weakening of the USD reflected in the EUR/USD and USD/JPY exchange rates, with the former climbing from 1.13 to 1.18 and the latter declining from 107.37 to 105.03, while USD/CNY remained relatively stable, ending at the same level as it started, suggesting a controlled exchange rate maintained by China.
