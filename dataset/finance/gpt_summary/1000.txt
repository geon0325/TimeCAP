Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 exhibited volatility with an initial decline followed by a rebound, closing at 3898.85 from an opening of 3821.62, suggesting a level of recovery despite intermittent fluctuations. The VIX, or Volatility Index, largely mirrored these movements with values ranging from 18.35 to 22.14, indicating periods of higher uncertainty, especially on days when the S&P 500 dipped. Global indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 overall trended upwards, with the FTSE 100 showing a more consistent increase, ending at 7747.30 from a starting point of 7370.60, which may reflect a stronger market sentiment in the UK. Gold Futures and Crude Oil Futures both increased in price, with Gold moving from 1815.90 to 1922.10 and Crude Oil from 76.09 to 80.33, suggesting investors might be hedging against inflation or market instability. Exchange rates saw the USD weakening against the EUR and JPY but slightly strengthening against the CNY, which could have implications for international trade dynamics and currency markets.
