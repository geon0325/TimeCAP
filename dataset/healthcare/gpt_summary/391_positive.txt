Over the last 20 weeks, a total of 854,660 respiratory specimens were tested for influenza, with an overall average positivity rate of 6.26%. The data indicates that Influenza B had a higher initial positivity rate, which has since decreased, whereas Influenza A showed a slight increase in positivity rate mid-analysis but has generally maintained lower rates throughout the period. The highest combined positivity rate of 1.31% occurred in week 9, with a notable peak in Influenza A positivity at 0.88% in week 14, suggesting a mid-period surge in type A infections. Despite these fluctuations, the overall positivity rates for both Influenza A and B have remained below the average ratio of positive specimens, indicating a relatively stable but persistent circulation of influenza within the population. This trend may suggest a need for sustained vigilance in public health measures and influenza surveillance to manage resource allocation and prevent potential surges in healthcare demand.
