Over the past 24 hours in New York City, temperatures have exhibited a gradual increase, reaching a peak in the late afternoon before tapering off slightly towards the evening. Humidity levels have shown considerable fluctuation, with notable spikes during the early morning hours, which is typical due to lower temperatures and potentially indicative of morning fog or dew. Air pressure readings were relatively stable initially but saw a significant increase towards the evening, suggesting the possible arrival of a high-pressure system that could lead to clearer skies. Wind speeds varied moderately throughout the day with a marked increase in the evening, pointing to breezier conditions that could affect outdoor activities and temperature perception. The wind direction has been predominantly from the south-southwest, shifting towards the west in the later hours, which may have contributed to the temperature rise by bringing in warmer air from those directions.
