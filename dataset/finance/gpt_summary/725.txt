Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 experienced a notable decline, closing lower from an initial position of 4700.90 to 4634.09, indicating increased market uncertainty. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, showed heightened volatility with a peak at 31.12 before settling at 21.89, which correlates with the observed unease in the equity markets. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 also reflected a downturn, with the Nikkei dropping from 29808.12 to 28432.64 and the FTSE 100 descending from 7327.00 to 7218.60, suggesting a global sentiment of risk aversion. Gold futures saw a decrease in value, demonstrating a divergence from the typical pattern of rising during times of market stress. The stability in exchange rates for EUR/USD, USD/JPY, and USD/CNY suggests that currency markets remained relatively calm amid fluctuations in equity and commodity markets.
