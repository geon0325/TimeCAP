Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable decrease in temperature which later stabilized and then gradually increased, indicative of a typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels saw a significant increase overnight, reaching saturation at one point, which could have led to foggy conditions or dew; however, these levels dropped as temperatures rose. Air pressure experienced a slight but steady decrease throughout the period, a trend that can be associated with the approach of a weather system that could potentially bring changes in weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally light with a significant decrease towards the end of the period, suggesting calm conditions. There was variability in wind direction, with a shift from southerly to northerly and then easterly winds, which may have influenced the temperature and humidity changes observed.
