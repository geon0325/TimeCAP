Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality ratio from influenza or pneumonia to total deaths has fluctuated, with an overall trend slightly below the average of 7.84%, reaching a high of 6.43% in the second week and a low of 5.00% in the fifteenth week. The absolute number of deaths from pneumonia has consistently been higher than those from influenza, with pneumonia deaths peaking at 3,722 in the second week, while influenza deaths remained relatively low, with a peak of 42 in the first week. The total number of deaths has also varied, with a high of 59,588 in the first week and a low of 55,582 in the fourteenth week, indicating some variability in overall mortality but without a clear increasing or decreasing trend. The ratio of mortality specifically from influenza or pneumonia to total deaths showed a slight increase in the last reported week (5.55%) compared to the previous week (5.41%), but it is still below the overall average of 7.84%. This consistent deviation below the average ratio suggests a potentially lower impact of these diseases on overall mortality during the reported period, which could indicate effective disease management or lower disease prevalence, but continued monitoring is necessary to identify any potential uptrends.
