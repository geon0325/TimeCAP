Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has exhibited mild volatility, fluctuating within a 4% range but ending slightly lower, suggesting a period of uncertainty among investors. The VIX, commonly known as the "fear gauge," has remained relatively subdued with minor fluctuations, indicating a market that is not expecting significant volatility in the short term. International markets as represented by the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 have shown resilience, with the Nikkei 225 trending upwards and the FTSE 100 reaching new highs, reflecting investor confidence in these markets. Commodity prices have seen an uptrend with Gold Futures remaining stable around the $1900 mark and Crude Oil Futures increasing by over 13%, which could signal growing concerns about inflation or geopolitical tensions affecting supply. Exchange rates have shown the US dollar strengthening against the euro but slightly weakening against the yen, while remaining relatively stable against the Chinese yuan, which may impact international trade dynamics and cross-border investment flows.
