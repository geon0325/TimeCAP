Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant fluctuation in mortality due to Influenza or Pneumonia in relation to total deaths. Initially, the ratio of mortality from these causes was below the 20-week average of 7.84%, with a gentle increase from 6.15% to 6.83% by the 10th week. However, a notable spike occurred from the 11th week onwards, reaching a peak at the 14th week with a ratio of 10.55%, which correlates with an absolute increase in deaths attributed to Influenza or Pneumonia, particularly Influenza with a dramatic rise from 157 to 1536 deaths between the 11th and 14th weeks. Following this peak, there has been a gradual decline, yet the ratio remains above the average, settling at 9.20% in the 20th week. This trend suggests a potential strain on healthcare resources due to a surge in severe respiratory infections, necessitating increased vigilance and potentially enhanced public health measures.
