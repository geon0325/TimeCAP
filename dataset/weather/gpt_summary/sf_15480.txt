Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a generally stable temperature profile with a gradual increase towards the latter hours, suggesting a warming trend as the day progressed into the evening. Humidity levels experienced some fluctuations but remained relatively high throughout the period, indicating a persistent presence of moisture in the air which could lead to a feeling of mugginess or the onset of fog, particularly common in coastal areas like San Francisco. Air pressure remained mostly steady with only minor variations, which is typical for stable weather conditions without the immediate expectation of significant weather changes such as storms. Wind speeds were light to gentle and showed an increase towards the end of the period, which could help to disperse humidity and reduce the potential for fog. The wind direction was predominantly from the southwest, which is a common pattern for the region and can influence the temperature and moisture conditions in the local area.
