Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a trend of declining influenza-like illness (ILI) rates, with the ratio of ILI patients gradually decreasing to below the baseline threshold of 2.9%. The highest ILI activity was observed in the age group of 5-24 years, which also experienced the most significant decline over the period. Although the ratio of ILI patients peaked above the baseline at one point, it has since fallen consistently across all age groups, suggesting a decrease in influenza transmission or reporting. The oldest age group (65 or more) consistently reported the lowest number of ILI patients, indicating that this demographic may be less affected or better protected. This downward trend in ILI cases may alleviate some pressure on the healthcare system, but continuous monitoring is essential to manage resources effectively and prepare for potential future outbreaks.
