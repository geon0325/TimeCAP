Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable decrease in the ratio of mortality due to Influenza or Pneumonia when compared to the total number of deaths, with the percentage dropping from 9.83% to 5.52%, which is below the average ratio of 7.84%. Despite fluctuations in the total number of deaths, the absolute number of deaths attributed to Influenza has increased in the most recent weeks, with a rise from 13 to 66 deaths. In contrast, the number of Pneumonia-related deaths has shown a downward trend, decreasing from 6182 to 2996 deaths over the same period. The significant drop in Pneumonia mortality contributes largely to the overall decrease in the Influenza or Pneumonia mortality ratio. This trend could indicate an improvement in the management and prevention of Pneumonia, despite a slight uptick in Influenza deaths, which may warrant continued monitoring and potentially targeted healthcare responses.
