Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia relative to total deaths, starting at 9.74% and peaking at 18.51% in week 10, before declining to 7.92% by week 20. This peak represents a significant increase of over 10 percentage points above the average ratio of 7.84%, suggesting a potential stress on healthcare resources during that period. Although the total number of deaths fluctuated, with the highest number recorded in week 8 (82,800) and the lowest in week 20 (61,811), the number of deaths from Influenza remained relatively stable with a slight increase in weeks 10 through 14, coinciding with the peak in the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia. In contrast, deaths from pneumonia showed a more pronounced increase during the same period, which could indicate a more substantial role of pneumonia in the overall increase in mortality ratio. The recent decline in mortality ratio to below the 20-week average suggests a potential easing of this specific healthcare burden, but continued monitoring is essential to understand the trend's implications fully and to manage healthcare resources effectively.
