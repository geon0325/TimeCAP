Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, moving from warmer conditions to cooler ones, especially noticeable during the late evening and early morning hours. Humidity levels varied significantly, with a peak in the early morning that suggested the presence of fog or mist, followed by lower levels during the day, which would have provided clearer conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, indicating a lack of strong weather systems moving through the area. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate with a brief period of increased wind intensity, which could have contributed to a temporary drop in temperature and a wind-chill factor. The wind direction shifted throughout the day, ranging from southwesterly to northwesterly, which is typical of the region's maritime influences.
