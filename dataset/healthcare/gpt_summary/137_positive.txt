Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with an overall average positivity rate of 6.26%. Despite this, the latest data indicates a rising trend in positive cases, with the percentages of positive specimens for both Influenza A and B increasing in the most recent weeks, reaching 1.32% and 0.43% respectively. The total number of specimens tested has also escalated, peaking at 16,528 in the last recorded week, which suggests a heightened level of surveillance or increased prevalence of respiratory illness prompting testing. Influenza A has consistently shown a higher positivity rate than Influenza B throughout the 20-week period, which could have implications for healthcare resource allocation and vaccination strategies. The healthcare system may need to prepare for continued or increased activity as the trend of positive influenza specimens is on the rise, potentially indicating the onset of a more intense influenza season.
