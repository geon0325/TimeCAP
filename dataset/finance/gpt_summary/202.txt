Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a consistent upward trend, closing with a significant increase from 3006.72 to 3120.46, indicating positive market sentiment. In contrast, the VIX, a measure of market volatility, has remained relatively low with minor fluctuations, ending slightly lower at 12.05, suggesting a stable market with reduced investor fear. The Nikkei 225 experienced mixed performance but ultimately rose, signifying strengthened confidence in the Japanese market, while the FTSE 100 showed modest growth, reflecting cautious optimism in the UK market. Gold futures saw some volatility but ended slightly lower at 1467.30, which could suggest a shift of investor preference towards riskier assets as gold typically performs well during times of uncertainty.
