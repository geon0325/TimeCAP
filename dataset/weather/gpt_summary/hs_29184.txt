Over the last 24 hours in Houston, there has been a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the latter part of the period analyzed. The relative humidity experienced a notable decrease as the temperatures rose, indicating a possible shift from cooler to warmer and drier conditions. Air pressure showed a slow decreasing trend, suggesting a change in the atmospheric conditions that could lead to potential weather system development. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, increasing slightly towards the end of the period, while the wind direction was predominantly from the south, shifting slightly to a more southwesterly direction later on. This combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and changing air pressure could suggest the onset of warmer and potentially less stable weather patterns for Houston.
