Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 experienced moderate fluctuations, showing a slight downward trend with a notable dip to 4513.04 before partially recovering to 4591.67, indicating potential market uncertainty or correction phases. The VIX, or Volatility Index, reflected increased market volatility, peaking at 31.12, which aligns with the observed instability in the S&P 500. International markets mirrored this volatility, with Japan's Nikkei 225 and the UK's FTSE 100 both experiencing declines, suggesting a broader sense of caution among global investors. Gold futures showed resilience amidst market turbulence, with prices remaining relatively stable, closing slightly lower at 1777.50 compared to the period's start, indicating its role as a safe-haven asset. Finally, the slight weakening of the EUR/USD exchange rate, paired with relatively stable USD/JPY and USD/CNY rates, suggests a stronger US dollar, which could impact export competitiveness and international investment flows.
