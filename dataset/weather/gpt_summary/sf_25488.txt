Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a moderate fluctuation in temperature, with a warming trend observed during the day followed by a slight cooling trend in the evening. Humidity levels varied considerably, with a noticeable increase during the early morning hours, indicative of possible morning fog, which is typical for the city, then decreasing during the day before rising again overnight. Air pressure showed a significant drop in the later hours, which could signal an approaching weather system with the potential for changes in weather patterns, such as increased wind speeds or precipitation. Wind conditions were generally mild to moderate, with some gusts of stronger winds, and predominant winds were westerly, which is standard for the coastal city. The variability in humidity and wind, along with the pressure drop, suggests that residents and visitors should prepare for a potential change in weather, possibly including cooler temperatures and increased chances of rain or fog.
