The VIX, commonly known as the "fear index," has moderately decreased from 23.70 to 21.57, indicating a slight reduction in market volatility and investor anxiety. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 have also demonstrated positive momentum, with the Nikkei gaining approximately 4.8% and the FTSE 100 showing more modest growth, reflecting a global inclination towards risk assets.

Commodity prices have varied, with gold futures experiencing a slight uptick by the end of the period, signaling sustained investor interest in safe-haven assets amidst market gains, while crude oil futures have seen a notable increase of over 16%, potentially indicative of expectations for an economic recovery enhancing demand. Exchange rates have seen the Euro and Japanese Yen appreciating against the US Dollar, with the EUR/USD moving from 1.19 to 1.23 and the USD/JPY declining from 103.82 to 103.13, whereas the USD/CNY has remained relatively stable, which could suggest a diversification away from the dollar and potential concerns about US economic outperformance.
