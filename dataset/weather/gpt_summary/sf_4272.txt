Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have shown a typical diurnal pattern, with cooler temperatures in the early hours and a gradual warming trend as the day progressed. Humidity levels were notably high, reaching saturation several times, which could have led to foggy conditions, especially during the night and early morning. Air pressure experienced a significant increase in the period, suggesting the strengthening of a high-pressure system that may lead to more stable weather conditions. Wind speeds were mostly light to gentle and showed some variability in direction, indicating that there were no strong wind events during this time frame. The combination of high humidity, light winds, and increasing air pressure may have resulted in calm but potentially misty or foggy conditions, particularly during nighttime and early morning hours.
