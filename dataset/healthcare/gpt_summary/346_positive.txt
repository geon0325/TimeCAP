Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable increase in the ratio of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the percentage rising from 0.97% in week 7 to 2.67% in week 20. The majority of these positive cases are attributable to Influenza A, which saw its positivity ratio climb significantly from 0.93% to 2.54% over the same period, indicating a growing prevalence of this strain. Influenza B, while less prevalent, also showed a slight upward trend in positivity from 0.05% to 0.13%. The overall average positivity ratio of 6.26% suggests that the current week 20 ratio of 2.67% is below the average, but the increasing trend could signal an upcoming rise in influenza cases that may place additional burden on healthcare resources. Given these trends, healthcare providers and public health officials should be prepared for a potential surge in influenza cases, ensuring sufficient medical supplies, vaccination efforts, and awareness campaigns are in place.
