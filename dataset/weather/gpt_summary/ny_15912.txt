Over the past 24 hours in New York City, there has been a gradual increase in temperature, reaching a peak in the later hours before exhibiting a slight decrease. Relative humidity showed a decreasing trend as the temperature rose, indicative of typical diurnal variation where warmer temperatures can hold more moisture, leading to lower relative humidity percentages. Air pressure consistently decreased over the period, which could suggest the approach of a low-pressure system, potentially leading to unsettled weather conditions. Wind speeds varied modestly with a slight increase towards the end of the period, which, along with shifting wind directions, suggests variable wind conditions. The predominant wind direction was from the south to the southwest, which is often associated with warmer air being drawn into the region.
