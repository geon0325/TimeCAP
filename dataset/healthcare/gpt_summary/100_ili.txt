Over the past 20 weeks, the data indicates fluctuations in the prevalence of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) across different age groups, with a noticeable peak in ILI ratios surpassing the baseline threshold, particularly in the middle of the observed period. The highest ILI activity was observed among the 5-24 age group, suggesting increased transmission within this demographic, potentially impacting schools and universities. Following the peak period, there has been a consistent decline in ILI ratios across all age groups, indicating a downtrend in ILI cases towards the end of the 20-week span. The age groups 0-4 and 65 or more, which often represent more vulnerable populations, have shown declining ILI ratios, which may alleviate some pressure on pediatric and geriatric healthcare services. The overall trend suggests a possible easing of the ILI burden on the healthcare system, but continuous monitoring is warranted to prepare for and manage potential future surges.
