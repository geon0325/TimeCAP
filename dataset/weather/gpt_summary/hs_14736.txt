Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a decrease in temperature from its peak during the early afternoon hours, which is typical of the diurnal cycle, before gradually stabilizing in the latter part of the day. Humidity levels fluctuated considerably, reaching saturation in the early morning, which could have led to foggy conditions, and then dropping significantly during the day, indicative of the drying effect of daytime heating. Air pressure variations were minimal, suggesting a relatively stable atmospheric condition without significant frontal activity. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate throughout the day, with some calm periods, and the prevailing winds shifted from southerly to more variable directions, including a notable westerly shift in the afternoon. The combination of high humidity and light winds overnight could lead to the formation of morning fog or dew, affecting visibility in the early hours.
