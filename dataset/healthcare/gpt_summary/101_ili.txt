The Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data over the last 20 weeks show fluctuations with an overall trend of initial increase followed by a decrease in the ratio of ILI patients. After surging and exceeding the baseline ratio, the ILI percentage has since declined, dropping below the baseline in the latter weeks. Notably, the highest incidence rates of ILI were observed in the younger populations, particularly in the age groups 0-4 and 5-24, which could indicate a higher transmission rate among children and young adults. The decrease in ILI rates across all age categories in recent weeks suggests a potential easing of the influenza situation. Health systems, while possibly relieved by the current downward trend, should remain vigilant for any signs of resurgence, especially in the younger demographics that have been most affected.
