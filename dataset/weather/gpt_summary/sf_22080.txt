Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual rise in temperature, followed by a slight decline and a subsequent increase, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels were relatively high, at one point reaching saturation, which may have led to foggy conditions, particularly during the cooler early morning hours. Air pressure remained relatively stable with only minor fluctuations, suggesting a period of settled weather without any significant frontal systems passing through the area. Wind speeds were consistently light, which, combined with high humidity, could have contributed to a sense of stillness and potential air quality concerns. The wind direction was predominantly westerly, which is common for the region and could have had a cooling effect on coastal areas.
