Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have shown a slight fluctuation with a general cooling trend overnight and a warming trend during the day. Humidity levels were high, indicating a moist air mass over the region, with a trend towards increased humidity during the nighttime hours, which could suggest the presence of marine influence or an approaching weather system. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight decrease towards the end of the period, which might indicate a gradual change in weather patterns or the approach of a new system.

Wind directions varied but were predominantly from the west and northwest, which is typical for San Francisco due to its coastal location and prevailing oceanic winds.
