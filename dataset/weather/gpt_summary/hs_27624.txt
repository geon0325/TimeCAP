Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced relatively stable temperatures with a slight warming trend observed in the later part of the timeframe. Humidity levels were consistently high, indicating a moist atmosphere, but there was a noticeable drop in the evening hours, which could have contributed to a feeling of increased comfort. Air pressure remained largely steady with a significant increase towards the end of the period, which can be associated with the arrival of a high-pressure system that may lead to clearer skies. Wind speeds varied moderately but were predominantly gentle to moderate, with the wind direction being primarily from the southeast, shifting slightly to the south-southeast later on. This consistent wind pattern suggests a stable weather system with no immediate signs of significant weather disturbances.
