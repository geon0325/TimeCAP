Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before stabilizing slightly above the day's average. Relative humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with a notable peak coinciding with the highest temperatures, suggesting the presence of considerable moisture in the air, potentially leading to a muggy feeling or precipitation. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with a slight overall decrease implying the possibility of changing weather conditions such as the approach of a weather front. Wind speeds were mostly gentle to moderate and showed no significant variations, while the wind direction was predominantly from the south, veering slightly at times but consistently indicating a southerly flow of air. This combination of high humidity, stable pressure, and southerly winds suggests that the weather in Houston could maintain its warm and humid conditions, with the potential for cloud development or precipitation if the humidity levels continue to interact with the daily temperature variations.
