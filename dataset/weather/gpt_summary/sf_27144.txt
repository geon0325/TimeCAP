Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a noticeable decrease in temperature, reaching its lowest point during the early morning hours before gradually rising throughout the day. Humidity levels have been relatively high, with a slight decrease in the late evening, suggesting a presence of moisture in the air that could contribute to cooler sensations or morning fog. Air pressure experienced a significant rise in the early hours, which has since stabilized, indicating a possible high-pressure system affecting the area, which is often associated with clearer skies. Wind speeds were generally light to gentle, with a period of calm winds around dawn, and a slight increase towards the evening, which could disperse any fog or low clouds. The wind direction varied significantly, shifting from predominantly westerly to northerly and then to a southerly direction, which may influence the movement of marine air and weather patterns across the region.
