Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, indicating a warming trend that peaked towards the latter part of the day. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with a notable peak at full saturation, suggesting the presence of fog or heavy dew at that time, followed by a sharp decrease which could imply clearing conditions. Air pressure showed a slight overall decrease, hinting at a potential change in weather patterns, such as the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds varied from calm to moderate and wind direction was predominantly from the north and northwest, which may have contributed to the transport of cooler air into the region earlier in the period. The combination of these factors suggests that while the day may have started cooler and more humid, it transitioned into a warmer and drier atmosphere, typical of variable spring weather in the region.
