Over the past 20 weeks, the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia to the total number of deaths has consistently remained below the average of 7.84%, with values fluctuating between 6.05% and 6.58%. The total number of deaths has shown slight variability but generally remained within the 57,000 to 59,000 range weekly. Deaths from pneumonia have been more prevalent than those from influenza, with pneumonia accounting for a significant majority of the combined Influenza or Pneumonia mortality count, peaking at 3,841 deaths in a week whereas influenza deaths did not exceed 89 in any given week. The highest combined weekly mortality ratio for Influenza or Pneumonia was 6.58%, which is still substantially lower than the average ratio, indicating a possible downtrend in these respiratory illnesses related mortality or improvements in their management. The persistent sub-average mortality rate from these conditions could signify a lessening burden on healthcare resources specifically allocated for Influenza and Pneumonia, potentially allowing for reallocation to other areas in need.
