Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility, but with a general uptrend, closing higher at 2971.61 from an initial value of 2797.80, which may indicate growing investor confidence despite uncertainties. The VIX has trended downwards, closing at 27.99, suggesting that market volatility is decreasing and could point to a stabilization of market sentiment. Gold Futures have seen an overall increase from 1733.30 to 1750.60, reflecting its status as a safe-haven asset amid market fluctuations, while Crude Oil Futures have more than doubled, ending at 33.49 from an initial 16.50, possibly due to production cuts and recovering demand as economies aim to reopen. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 both displayed a recovery trend, closing higher at 20595.15 and 6067.20, respectively, which could indicate a cautious optimism in global equity markets. Currency markets have shown minor fluctuations, with the EUR/USD and USD/JPY pairs remaining relatively stable, while a slight depreciation of the USD against the CNY could suggest a shift in the economic outlook towards Asian markets.
