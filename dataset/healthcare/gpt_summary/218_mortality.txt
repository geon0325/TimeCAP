Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in the mortality rate from influenza and pneumonia, relative to the total number of deaths. Despite the average ratio of mortality from influenza or pneumonia being 7.84%, the provided data indicates a trend where this ratio started above the average at 8.82% and has experienced a general decline, reaching a low of 5.91% in week 16 before rising again to 8.48% in the most recent week. The absolute number of deaths from pneumonia shows a similar pattern, with an initial decrease from 5306 to a low of 3384 deaths, followed by a resurgence to 5094 deaths. The influenza mortality count remained relatively low and stable, with minor fluctuations but no clear trend. This observed volatility in pneumonia-related mortality rates, coupled with the recent increase, could signal potential stress on healthcare resources and may necessitate targeted public health interventions to manage the rise effectively.
