Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a concerning upward trend in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to total deaths, beginning at 5.38% and rising to 7.40%, surpassing the average ratio of 7.84% in the final week. Notably, the absolute number of deaths attributed to Influenza has dramatically increased in the last two weeks, jumping from a range of 7-46 in the preceding 18 weeks to 92 and 157, respectively. Pneumonia-related deaths have also shown a consistent upward trend, rising from 2689 to 4108 over the period. This increase in mortality from respiratory illnesses may suggest a seasonal pattern or an emerging health threat, such as a particularly virulent strain of influenza or other respiratory pathogens. The healthcare system may need to prepare for increased demand for medical care and consider reinforcing vaccination programs, public health campaigns, and resources to address this rising trend.
