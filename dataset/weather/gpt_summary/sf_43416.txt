Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, which later reversed with a warming trend towards the current hour. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, with a notable peak coinciding with the cooler temperatures, indicative of a possible marine layer influence or early morning fog, which later dissipated as temperatures rose. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight increase mid-period, suggesting stable weather conditions without the presence of significant frontal systems. Wind speeds varied, with some gustier conditions, but overall, winds were moderate and shifted direction from mainly westerly to a brief northerly direction before returning to westerly, reflecting typical patterns for coastal environments. These combined factors suggest a typical weather pattern for San Francisco with variations in temperature and humidity that are normal for this coastal city.
