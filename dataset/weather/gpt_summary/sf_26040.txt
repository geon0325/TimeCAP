Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a gradual decrease in temperature, indicative of a typical diurnal cycle transitioning from warmer daytime to cooler night conditions. Humidity levels have shown fluctuations, with notable peaks suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air at certain hours, which could have led to fog or mist, especially when coupled with the corresponding peaks in air pressure. Speaking of air pressure, there was a significant increase at one point, which typically signals the arrival of a high-pressure system, potentially bringing clearer skies following that time. Wind speeds varied, with some hours experiencing calm conditions and others having moderately strong winds, which could have influenced the dispersal of fog or low-lying clouds in the area. The wind direction was predominantly from the west and northwest, which is characteristic of the maritime influence on San Francisco's weather, possibly ushering in cooler, oceanic air.
