Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching a peak in the later hours before a slight decrease. Relative humidity levels have varied, starting at moderate levels, increasing during the night, and then dropping significantly towards the afternoon, with a subsequent sharp rise towards the end of the period. Air pressure remained relatively stable for most of the day but saw a significant drop in the final hours. Wind speeds were mostly moderate but showed some variability, with generally higher speeds in the earlier hours that tapered off before picking up again. The wind direction was predominantly westerly, with a notable shift to northerly in the final hours, which, combined with the drop in air pressure, could indicate the approach of a new weather system.
