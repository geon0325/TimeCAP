Over the past 24 hours in New York City, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature with a general upward trend, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before gradually declining. Humidity levels have shown significant variation, starting moderate, then rising notably during the night and early morning hours, which could have contributed to a more muggy feel, and then dropping sharply towards the evening, indicating drier conditions. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable with only minor fluctuations throughout the day, suggesting stable weather conditions without the immediate approach of major weather systems. Wind speeds were generally light to gentle and showed some variability, with two distinct peaks that could have contributed to brief periods of cooler wind chill. Wind direction varied widely, suggesting shifting weather patterns, ranging from predominantly westerly to easterly and then to southerly flows, which could influence the transportation of air masses and associated weather conditions in the near term.
