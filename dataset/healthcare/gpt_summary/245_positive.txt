Over the last 20 weeks, the overall percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza has been below the average (6.26%), with a peak positivity ratio of 0.40% in week 14. Influenza A and B have both shown fluctuations in their positivity rates, with Influenza A reaching a maximum of 0.23% in week 1 and Influenza B peaking at 0.22% in week 14. The most significant increase in the number of specimens tested occurred between weeks 15 and 20, suggesting heightened surveillance or increased incidence of respiratory illness, coinciding with an increase in positive Influenza B cases. Despite the uptick in testing, the ratio of positive specimens has not proportionately increased, indicating that the spread may be contained or other respiratory pathogens may be involved. Healthcare systems should remain vigilant for potential surges in influenza activity and ensure adequate resources for testing and vaccination, especially during weeks with higher positivity rates.
