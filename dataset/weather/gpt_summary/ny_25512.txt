Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual rise in temperature, reaching a peak before slightly declining towards the end of the observed period. Humidity levels varied significantly, with a notable increase during cooler early morning hours and a decrease as temperatures rose, indicating a typical diurnal pattern. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight downward trend, suggesting a minor change in the atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with some increase later in the period, which could contribute to a slight cooling effect and dispersion of urban pollutants. The wind direction was predominantly from the west and southwest, shifting at times, which is expected to influence the transportation of air masses and the potential for coastal breezes in the city.
