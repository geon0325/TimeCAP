Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has experienced volatility with a general downward trend, closing lower by approximately 4.6% from the first to the last day recorded. The VIX, which measures market volatility, has remained elevated with an upward trend, reflecting increased market uncertainty, peaking on day 13 in correspondence with the lowest S&P 500 closing. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 indices have similarly shown declines, with the Nikkei 225 witnessing a drop and slight recovery, while the FTSE 100 has steadily decreased, indicating broader global market pressures. Commodity prices have seen a mix of fluctuations; Gold Futures have declined by approximately 1.1%, suggesting a possible shift from safe-haven assets, while Crude Oil Futures have notably decreased by about 5.5%, which could signal changing expectations in energy demand or supply dynamics. Exchange rates have shown the US dollar strengthening against the Japanese Yen and the Chinese Yuan but weakening against the Euro, pointing to nuanced shifts in currency markets that could affect international trade and investment flows.
