Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have shown a typical diurnal pattern, with a gradual increase during the day following a cooler night. Humidity levels were high for the most part, suggesting the presence of considerable moisture in the air, with several instances of reaching saturation which could have led to foggy conditions, particularly when temperatures were lower. Air pressure has been slowly decreasing, which could be indicative of an approaching weather system that may potentially alter current conditions. Wind speeds remained mostly light to gentle, with some variability in the middle of the day, which is not uncommon for coastal cities like San Francisco. The wind direction varied significantly, showing a shift from northerly to more westerly and southerly directions, which could influence local weather patterns such as fog dispersal and the movement of marine air inland.
