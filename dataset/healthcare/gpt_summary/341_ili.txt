Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a gradual increase in the ratio of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) patients, with the latest figures exceeding the baseline threshold, indicating a heightened level of ILI activity. The age group of 0-4 years consistently had the highest number of ILI cases, suggesting a greater vulnerability or exposure within this demographic. Notably, all age groups have shown an upward trend in ILI cases, with both the youngest (0-4 years) and the school-age (5-24 years) groups experiencing a substantial rise in recent weeks, potentially impacting school attendance and pediatric healthcare services. The oldest age group (65 or more) also showed a significant increase in ILI cases towards the end of the period, raising concerns for this high-risk population and the potential for increased hospitalizations. This overall rise in ILI cases may strain healthcare resources and underscores the need for enhanced surveillance, prevention, and management strategies, especially for the most affected age groups.
