Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable increase in temperature, transitioning from cooler conditions in the early hours to warmer temperatures by the end of the period. Humidity levels remained high throughout the day, often reaching saturation, indicating a significant amount of moisture in the air which could lead to foggy conditions or precipitation if temperatures drop. The air pressure has been gradually decreasing, which could be indicative of an approaching weather system that might bring changes in weather patterns, such as increased cloudiness or a higher chance of storms. Wind speeds have been consistently light, suggesting a relatively calm atmospheric state without significant wind-driven events. The wind direction varied but showed a general preference for easterly directions, which is typical for sea breezes that can influence local weather conditions by bringing in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico.
