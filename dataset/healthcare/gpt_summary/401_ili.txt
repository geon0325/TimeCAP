Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a significant rise in the proportion of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases among all age groups, surpassing the 2.9% severity benchmark in week six and peaking at 7.37% in week eleven. The highest increase in ILI cases was observed in the age groups 0-4 and 5-24, which may suggest higher transmission rates or lower immunity levels within these populations. The sustained elevation above the severity threshold for several weeks points to a substantial influenza season, putting increased pressure on healthcare resources, potentially leading to longer wait times, and a greater burden on healthcare professionals. After reaching its peak, there has been a gradual decline in the percentage of ILI cases, yet it remains above the benchmark, indicating the situation has not fully resolved. This trend necessitates continued monitoring and possibly increased flu vaccination outreach, especially targeting the most affected age groups to mitigate the spread and impact of influenza.
