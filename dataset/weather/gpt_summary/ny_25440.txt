Over the last 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, indicating a warming trend that peaked in the late afternoon before slightly cooling down again towards the evening. Humidity levels varied significantly, starting at moderate levels before rising to very high in the early morning, which could have led to a feeling of mugginess, and then decreasing as the temperature peaked, likely making the warmer temperatures feel more comfortable. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with only minor fluctuations, suggesting that no significant weather systems were moving through the area that would cause abrupt weather changes. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with an increase during the late afternoon, which could have contributed to a decrease in humidity levels. The wind direction was variable, predominantly coming from the north-northwest, shifting towards the north and then varying more widely in the afternoon and evening, which may have influenced the dispersion of any localized air pollutants in the city.
