Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable increase in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the overall positivity rate growing from 1.00% to 7.00%. This trend is reflected in both Influenza A and B, with Influenza A showing a more pronounced increase in positivity from 0.65% to 5.55%. Influenza B also increased but at a slower rate, starting at 0.35% and reaching 1.45%. The peak in positive specimens corresponds with a substantial rise in the number of specimens tested, suggesting a possible surge in influenza cases requiring healthcare resources. The significant growth in the positivity rate, especially for Influenza A, could indicate an ongoing or upcoming influenza season, necessitating increased vigilance and potentially straining healthcare systems.
