Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have experienced a diurnal cycle, beginning high, cooling towards the early hours, and then increasing again through the day. Humidity levels showed significant variation, with notable peaks coinciding with the cooler temperatures in the early hours, which is typical as cooler air can hold less moisture before it condenses. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight decreasing trend observed towards the end of the period, which could suggest an approaching weather system or front. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with occasional higher gusts, and the prevailing wind direction shifted from southeasterly to southwesterly and back, indicating variable wind patterns. These weather conditions, with high humidity and fluctuating wind directions, could potentially lead to the development of localized weather events such as thunderstorms or heavy rain showers in the Houston area.
