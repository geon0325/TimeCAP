Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable decline in the percentage of deaths attributable to influenza or pneumonia when compared to the total number of deaths. Initially, the ratio was significantly above the historical average of 7.84%, peaking at 10.39% in the first week; however, this ratio has decreased steadily, reaching a low of 5.91% in the second-to-last week. The decline in the ratio suggests an improvement in the management or a seasonal decline of these respiratory conditions. Despite this positive trend, the absolute number of deaths from pneumonia remains substantial, warranting continued public health attention and resources. The slight increase in the ratio to 6.73% in the last week could indicate variability in the data or a potential uptick in cases that should be monitored closely.
