Over the past 20 weeks, the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia to the total number of deaths has shown fluctuations but has generally exceeded the average of 7.84%, peaking at 13.74% and recently declining to 6.64%. There was a significant spike in deaths attributed to influenza in the 12th week, with 887 deaths, which is substantially higher than any other week and likely indicates an outbreak. The number of deaths from pneumonia has generally been on a decreasing trend after reaching a high in the 10th week with 10,052 deaths. Despite the overall decrease in recent weeks, the mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia remains a concern as it continues to account for a considerable proportion of total deaths. The healthcare system may need to be vigilant and possibly allocate more resources towards managing these diseases, especially given the observed peaks which may indicate seasonal trends or other epidemiological factors at play.
