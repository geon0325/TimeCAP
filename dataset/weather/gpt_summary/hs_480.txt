Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before slightly cooling down towards the evening. Humidity levels were high throughout the day, with a period of complete saturation suggesting the possibility of fog or mist in the early morning hours. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight increase midday, which could indicate stable weather conditions. Wind speeds varied, showing an increase during the daytime, which is typical due to solar heating effects, and the wind direction was predominantly from the southeast, shifting significantly only on a couple of occasions. The combination of high humidity, stable pressure, and moderate to light winds suggests that there was likely no significant weather disturbance during this period, although the high humidity could have led to discomfort for those outdoors.
