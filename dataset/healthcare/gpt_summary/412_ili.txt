Over the past 20 weeks, the proportion of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases among all patients has shown a declining trend, with the most recent ratio falling to 2.07%, which is below the 2.9% benchmark for assessing the severity of influenza. The highest ratio of ILI patients was observed in the first week at 7.24%, indicating a significant decrease over the period. The age group 0-4 consistently had the highest number of ILI cases compared to other age groups, although the absolute numbers have decreased for all age groups throughout the 20 weeks. The reduction in ILI ratios suggests that the healthcare system may currently be experiencing a lessening burden from influenza cases. However, the persistent presence of ILI cases, particularly in the youngest age group, indicates a continued need for vigilance and preparedness in managing pediatric healthcare resources.
