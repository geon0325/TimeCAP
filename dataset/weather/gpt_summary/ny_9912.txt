Over the past 24 hours in New York City, the temperature exhibited a downward trend, indicating a cooling period as we moved through the day into the night. Humidity levels fluctuated but showed a slight increase overall, which could contribute to a feeling of chilliness in the air, especially during the cooler hours. Air pressure saw a steady rise throughout the period, suggesting the arrival or strengthening of a high-pressure system, which is often associated with clearer and more stable weather conditions. Wind speeds varied but were generally moderate to strong, with some gusts that could enhance the wind chill effect, making it feel colder than the actual temperature. The prevailing wind direction was predominantly westerly, with occasional shifts towards the north, which is typical for the passage of weather fronts or the influence of larger weather systems in the area.
