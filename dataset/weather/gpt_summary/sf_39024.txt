Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a slight upward trend in temperature, ending the period somewhat warmer than it started. Humidity levels have shown significant fluctuations but generally remained high, suggesting a notable presence of moisture in the air that could lead to foggy conditions, particularly given the city's coastal location. Air pressure has been relatively stable but displayed a sharp drop towards the end of the observed period, which might indicate the approach of a weather system that could lead to changes in the weather pattern, such as increased chances of precipitation or wind. Speaking of wind, the city has seen light to moderate breezes with varying directions, implying that the winds were not consistent and may have contributed to variable weather conditions. Lastly, the wind direction has shifted substantially throughout the day, which could affect coastal conditions and potentially lead to changes in sea currents and temperatures near the bay.
