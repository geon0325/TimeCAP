Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced mild fluctuations in temperature, with a general trend of cooling during the early hours and a gradual warming later in the day. Humidity levels were consistently high, suggesting a presence of moisture in the air that may lead to foggy conditions, especially during the times when humidity reached saturation. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, indicating a likelihood of steady weather patterns without significant short-term changes. Wind speeds were mostly light and variable, with occasional calm conditions, which could lead to poor dispersion of air pollutants, potentially affecting air quality. The wind direction shifted notably during the period, which could influence coastal weather conditions and temperatures in the city, depending on whether the winds were onshore or offshore.
