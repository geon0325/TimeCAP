The analysis of the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data over the last 20 weeks indicates that there was a significant increase in ILI cases that peaked in the middle of the observed period before gradually declining to below the baseline of 2.9%. The age group of 5-24 years exhibited the largest number of ILI cases, suggesting that schools and universities could be important settings for the transmission of ILI. The oldest age group, those aged 65 and above, consistently showed the lowest number of cases, which may reflect higher vaccination rates or possibly less interaction with high-transmission settings. The steady decrease in ILI cases across all age groups in the latter weeks suggests a waning phase of the ILI season or effective public health interventions. The current decline below the baseline threshold indicates a reduced burden on the healthcare system, potentially allowing for reallocation of resources that were previously directed towards managing the higher number of ILI cases.
