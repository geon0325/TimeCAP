Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a gradual uptrend, moving from 4455.48 to 4549.78, suggesting investor confidence and a potentially bullish market sentiment. The VIX, or Volatility Index, has decreased from 17.75 to 15.01, indicating a decline in market volatility and possibly a stable investment environment. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 display some volatility, with the Nikkei showing a notable dip mid-period before recovering, while the FTSE 100 exhibited a more stable but slight uptrend, ending slightly lower at 7190.30 from an earlier peak. Commodity prices for Gold and Crude Oil Futures have both seen increases, with Gold moving from 1749.70 to 1781.20 and Crude Oil from 73.98 to 82.50, reflecting investors' hedge against inflation and the ongoing demand recovery in the energy sector. The currency exchange rates have remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations; EUR/USD and USD/CNY pairs showed marginal changes, while the USD/JPY pair presented a slight appreciation of the USD over the period.
