Humidity levels were notably high, particularly during the night and early morning hours, suggesting a presence of moisture that could lead to foggy conditions, a common occurrence in this region. The air pressure remained relatively constant throughout the period, with a slight drop towards the end of the period, which might indicate an approaching weather system that could alter current conditions.
