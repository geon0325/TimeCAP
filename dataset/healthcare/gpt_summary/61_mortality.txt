Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable decline in the proportion of deaths attributed to Influenza or Pneumonia relative to total mortality, with the ratio decreasing from an initial 8.00% to 5.36%, which is below the 20-week average ratio of 7.84%. The absolute number of deaths from Influenza has significantly decreased from 507 to 8 deaths per week, suggesting a substantial reduction in Influenza mortality. Pneumonia-related deaths have also shown a downward trend, though less pronounced, dropping from 4061 to 2706 deaths per week. This overall decline in mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia could indicate the effectiveness of public health interventions, seasonal patterns of respiratory illnesses, or improved clinical management of these conditions. However, given that these diseases still account for a substantial portion of overall mortality, continued vigilance and resources may be necessary to manage their impact on the healthcare system.
