Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has experienced a noticeable drop during the early hours, followed by a steady increase towards the latter part of the day. Relative humidity levels remained high throughout the period, peaking during the cooler early hours, which is indicative of a muggy atmosphere that may have felt quite uncomfortable. Air pressure has been relatively stable, with only slight fluctuations, suggesting no immediate, significant changes in weather patterns.

Wind direction has shown a gradual shift from the southeast to the south-southeast, which could influence the transportation of moisture and the development of localized weather phenomena.
