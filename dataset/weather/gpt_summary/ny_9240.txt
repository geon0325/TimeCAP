Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a decrease in temperature followed by a slight increase, suggesting a typical diurnal variation with cooler conditions overnight warming up during the day. Humidity levels fluctuated, peaking around the same time as the lowest temperatures, which is common as cooler air holds less moisture, making the air feel more saturated. A significant rise in air pressure followed a notable drop, indicating the possible passage of a weather front and the establishment of a high-pressure system, often associated with calmer and clearer weather conditions. Wind speeds remained relatively constant throughout the period, with a slight increase towards the end of the 24 hours. The wind direction shifted slightly from predominantly westerly to a more northerly component, which could bring changes in temperature and moisture levels depending on the larger-scale weather patterns at play.
