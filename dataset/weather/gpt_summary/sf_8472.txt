Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature, with a peak during the day followed by a significant dip in the late evening into the night, which is a typical diurnal pattern. Humidity levels experienced a marked increase through the night into the early morning, suggesting the presence of moisture that could lead to morning fog, a common occurrence in this region. Air pressure has remained relatively stable but did experience a slight increase in the latter part of the day, which could indicate a transient high-pressure system moving through the area, potentially leading to clearer skies. Wind speeds were generally light throughout the period, with a slight increase observed in the later hours, which could contribute to the dispersal of any coastal fog. The wind direction has been variable but predominantly from a westerly direction, aligning with the common wind patterns for San Francisco due to its coastal geography.
