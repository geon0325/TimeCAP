Over the past 20 weeks, the data indicates a fluctuating but generally increasing trend in the ratio of positive respiratory specimens for influenza, with a recent uptick to 1.09% from a low of 0.70% five weeks prior. This increase is driven by a rise in both Influenza A and B positive specimens, with Influenza A showing a more pronounced increase in its positivity rate from 0.47% to 0.66% in the same period. The ratio of positive specimens for Influenza B also increased from a low of 0.22% to 0.42% by the end of the 20-week period. The total number of specimens tested has been growing, with the last week reaching the highest count of 64,790 tests. Given these trends, healthcare systems should prepare for a potential surge in influenza cases, which could strain resources and necessitate increased vaccination and public health measures.
