Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, with the coolest conditions recorded during the early hours before a slight warming trend in the afternoon. Humidity levels have fluctuated, reaching their peak coinciding with the lowest temperatures, which is typical as cooler air can hold less moisture before it condenses. Atmospheric pressure has remained relatively stable, with a slight increase observed, indicative of fair weather conditions that are likely to persist in the absence of significant pressure drops. Wind speeds have generally been moderate but decreased towards the end of the period, which could result in less dispersion of any airborne particles, potentially affecting air quality. The wind direction has been variable, with a trend towards calmer winds coming from different directions, suggesting a transitional weather pattern without a dominant weather front.
