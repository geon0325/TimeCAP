Humidity levels were inversely correlated with temperature, starting relatively moderate, increasing to saturation during the coldest hours, and then decreasing as temperatures rose. Atmospheric pressure showed a steady downward trend throughout the period, indicating a possible change in weather patterns or the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds remained mostly light, with slight increases observed intermittently, which is common for coastal cities like San Francisco.
