The analysis of the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data over the past 20 weeks indicates a fluctuating but overall increasing trend in the ratio of ILI patients, which has remained below the baseline value. While the total number of patients has varied, there has been a significant spike in the most recent week. The younger age groups, particularly those aged 0-4 and 5-24, are showing the highest counts of ILI, suggesting that ILI is currently more prevalent among children and young adults. Although the numbers are lower in older age groups, there is a noticeable uptick in ILI cases in individuals aged 65 or more in the latest data. This upward trend, especially if it continues or exceeds the baseline threshold, could place additional strain on healthcare resources and necessitate a heightened public health response to manage the spread of ILI.
