Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable increase in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the average positive ratio rising from 0.93% to 15.86%. This trend is marked by a significant growth in both Influenza A and B detections, with Influenza A positive specimen percentages peaking at 14.99% in week 14 and Influenza B increasing steadily to a high of 6.06% in week 20. The total number of specimens tested spiked in week 11, suggesting an increased testing effort potentially in response to the rising number of cases. The ratio of positive specimens reached a peak of 18.27% in week 14, indicating a substantial prevalence of influenza during that period. This rise in flu cases could lead to increased hospitalizations and a strain on healthcare resources, emphasizing the need for continued surveillance and possibly increased vaccination efforts.
