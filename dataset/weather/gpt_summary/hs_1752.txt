Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature with a peak during the latter part of the period, suggesting warmer conditions moving into the area. Humidity levels showed a slight fluctuation but maintained a general decrease towards the end of the day, which could have contributed to more comfortable conditions despite the temperature rise. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight increase in the middle of the period, indicating steady weather patterns without the immediate approach of significant weather fronts. Wind speeds were mostly calm but increased during the day, possibly bringing in warmer air from other regions. The wind direction was primarily from the southeast, consistent with the Gulf of Mexico's influence on Houston's weather, which often brings in moisture and can result in higher humidity levels.
