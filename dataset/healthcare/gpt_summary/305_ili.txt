Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a consistent pattern of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) activity remaining below the baseline level, indicating a relatively stable and controlled influenza situation. The youngest age group (0-4 years) experienced a gradual increase in ILI cases, which could signal a heightened vulnerability or increased transmission within this demographic. The other age groups, although fluctuating, generally showed either a decrease or a stabilization in ILI cases over the period. However, the overall ratio of ILI patients has remained under the threshold of concern but displayed a slight uptick in recent weeks, necessitating continued monitoring. The healthcare system, while not currently strained by ILI, should remain vigilant, especially with respect to the youngest population, to promptly address any potential outbreaks and prevent widespread transmission.
