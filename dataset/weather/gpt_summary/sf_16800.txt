Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature with a general cooling trend toward the early morning hours before gradually warming up again. Relative humidity levels were high, peaking during the night and early morning, which could be indicative of fog or mist typically seen in the area, especially with 100% humidity readings suggesting very dense air moisture. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, indicating steady weather conditions without significant fronts or storms passing through. Wind speeds were light and mostly constant, with only a slight increase in the later hours, which should not have a substantial impact on day-to-day activities. Wind direction shifted from westerly to more southerly throughout the day, which might have influenced the humidity levels and temperature experienced in the city.
