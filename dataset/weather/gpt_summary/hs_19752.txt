Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have experienced slight fluctuations with a general cooling trend observed during the latter part of the time series. Humidity levels have remained extremely high throughout the period, consistently reaching saturation at certain points, which indicates a strong possibility of fog or precipitation. Air pressure has been relatively stable with a slight tendency to increase, suggesting stable weather conditions may prevail. Wind speeds have been mostly light to gentle, with occasional moderate gusts, and the wind direction has been variable with no predominant direction sustained over the period. This combination of high humidity, stable but slightly rising air pressure, and variable winds suggests that the weather has been calm, yet the potential for fog or mist in the near term should be considered, especially during early morning or late evening hours.
