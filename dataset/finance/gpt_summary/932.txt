Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has exhibited a downtrend, decreasing from 3946.01 to 3588.84, which suggests a bearish market sentiment. The VIX, commonly known as the "fear index," has risen from 26.16 to 33.63, indicating increased market volatility and investor uncertainty. International markets have echoed this sentiment, with Japan's Nikkei 225 and the UK's FTSE 100 both experiencing declines, most notably the Nikkei 225 dropping from 27818.62 to 26401.25. Gold futures have fluctuated but ended slightly lower at 1678.70 from an initial 1696.50, which may reflect its status as a safe-haven asset amidst market turbulence. Crude oil futures have similarly experienced volatility but trended downwards, starting at 88.48 and closing at 89.35, while currency exchange rates have seen the EUR/USD oscillating around parity and the USD strengthening against both the JPY and CNY, potentially signaling a flight to the perceived safety of the US dollar.
