Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a steady decline in temperature leading into the early hours, followed by a significant increase as the day progressed, before slightly dropping again in the later hours. Concurrently, humidity levels fluctuated, with peaks generally correlating to the times when temperatures were at their lowest, indicating a possible early morning and late evening moisture presence. Air pressure remained relatively high and stable throughout the period, with only a slight decreasing trend toward the end of the 24 hours, potentially suggesting stable weather conditions but with a slight possibility of changing patterns. Wind speeds were predominantly light and showed minimal variation, with a slight increase during the midday hours. The wind direction was variable, though predominantly from the northeast, shifting to a southerly direction in the afternoon, and then reverting to a northeasterly direction, which could affect local wind chill factors and the distribution of humidity.
