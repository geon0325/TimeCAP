Over the past 20 weeks, the data indicates a consistent increase in the proportion of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases across all age groups, with the total ILI ratio gradually rising from 1.91% to 2.26%, nearing the 2.9% benchmark that denotes a severe influenza situation. The most significant increase in ILI cases has been observed in the 0-4 and 5-24 age groups, with the former rising from 9389 to 13511 cases and the latter from 14611 to 18994 cases, suggesting a higher transmission rate among younger populations. Although the ILI ratio has not surpassed the threshold, the steady growth in the number of cases, especially notable in the last five weeks, may signal a potential strain on healthcare resources if the trend continues. Additionally, the overall increase in patient count over the 20 weeks, reaching a peak in the last recorded week with 2491208 patients, could further challenge the healthcare system's capacity. It is crucial to monitor these trends closely and prepare for increased healthcare demands, including vaccination efforts, public health messaging, and resource allocation to mitigate the impact of rising ILI cases.
