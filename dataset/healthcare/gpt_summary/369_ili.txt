Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a gradual increase in the ratio of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) patients across all age groups, with a peak that eventually surpassed the baseline threshold, before showing a recent decline. The age group 0-4 years consistently showed the highest number of ILI patients, suggesting a higher vulnerability or transmission rate within this demographic. The age groups 5-24 and 25-49 followed suit with their own peaks, indicating widespread transmission among school-aged children and working adults, which could have implications for school attendance and workplace health policies. The older age groups, 50-64 and 65 or more, had fewer ILI cases but still followed the overall trend, which is important as these groups typically have a higher risk for complications. The recent decrease in the ratio of ILI patients across all age groups suggests that the ILI season may be waning, but healthcare systems should remain vigilant for potential rebounds and ensure resources are in place for at-risk populations.
