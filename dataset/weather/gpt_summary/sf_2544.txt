Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperature demonstrated a typical diurnal pattern, with the lowest values occurring in the early morning hours before warming up later in the day. Humidity levels varied significantly, starting at moderate levels, decreasing around midday, and then peaking in the overnight hours, indicative of coastal influence and possible morning fog or marine layer conditions. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight increase throughout the day, suggesting stable weather conditions are prevailing. Wind speeds were predominantly calm, with occasional light breezes, and the wind direction was variable when breezes did occur, although there were several hours with no recorded wind direction or speed, indicating very calm conditions. The combination of stable air pressure, variable but generally low wind speeds, and fluctuating humidity suggests that San Francisco has experienced relatively tranquil weather but with potential for morning and evening coastal fog or low clouds.
