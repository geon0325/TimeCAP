The VIX, or Volatility Index, experienced a notable spike towards the end, rising from a low of 12.32 to 16.28, suggesting an increase in market volatility and potential investor anxiety. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 both displayed volatility with general upward movements, but the Nikkei closed lower at 23215.71 compared to the opening 23656.62, while the FTSE 100 showed resilience, ending at 7480.70 from an initial 7587.10 despite mid-period fluctuations.

Crude Oil Futures, conversely, exhibited a distinct downward trend, dropping from 61.68 to 53.48, which could signal a bearish outlook on global economic growth or a response to oversupply concerns. The foreign exchange rates of EUR/USD and USD/CNY remained relatively stable with a slight depreciation of the dollar, while the USD/JPY experienced minor fluctuations but ended marginally lower, indicating a slight strengthening of the yen against the dollar.
