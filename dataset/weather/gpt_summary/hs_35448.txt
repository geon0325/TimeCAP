Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a moderately fluctuating temperature pattern, with a peak during the daytime and a noticeable cool down overnight, which is typical of the diurnal temperature variation. The relative humidity showed an inverse correlation with temperature, peaking during the coolest parts of the early morning hours, indicative of a more muggy start to the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with only slight variations, suggesting stable weather conditions without significant changes in weather patterns. Wind speeds were generally light to gentle and showed a minor decreasing trend overnight before picking up slightly again during the day, which is typical as the land heats up and affects local wind circulation. The wind direction was predominantly from the south-southeast, which in Houston, could be associated with bringing increased moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, potentially contributing to the higher humidity levels observed.
