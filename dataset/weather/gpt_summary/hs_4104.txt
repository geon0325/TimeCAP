Over the last 24 hours in Houston, the temperature experienced a typical diurnal pattern with a peak during the day followed by a gradual cooling towards the early hours. Humidity levels saw significant increases overnight, reaching saturation, which could indicate the presence of fog or dew during those times. Atmospheric pressure showed a steady decline, suggesting a potential change in the weather pattern, possibly leading to instability or the arrival of a weather system. Wind speeds varied from calm to moderate throughout the period, with a notable increase in the evening that persisted into the night, and wind direction was predominantly from the southeast, shifting at times but generally indicating a consistent weather pattern from that direction. These conditions combined point to a dynamic weather situation that may involve morning humidity-related phenomena and a chance of changing weather conditions due to the decreasing pressure.
