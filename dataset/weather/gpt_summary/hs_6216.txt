Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature exhibited a diurnal cycle with a gradual increase during the day, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before decreasing overnight. Humidity levels fluctuated inversely to temperature, starting moderately high in the early hours, increasing to very high as temperatures cooled, and then dropping during the hottest part of the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a minor fluctuation, indicating no significant weather fronts moving through the area. Wind speeds were mostly light to gentle, suggesting a calm weather pattern, with the wind direction showing variability, although primarily coming from the south-southeast to the south-southwest, which is typical for Houston's climate. The combination of high temperatures and humidity indicates muggy conditions that are common in the region, but the lack of strong wind or significant pressure changes suggests no immediate threat of severe weather.
