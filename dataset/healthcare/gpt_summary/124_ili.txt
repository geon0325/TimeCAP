Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a steady increase in the number of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases across all age groups, with the most prominent rise observed in the youngest (0-4 years) and school-aged children (5-24 years). Despite the growing number of ILI cases, the overall ratio of patients with ILI symptoms has remained below the baseline of 2.9%, suggesting that the healthcare system is not currently experiencing an unusually high burden from influenza. However, the consistent upward trend in ILI ratios, particularly in the latter weeks, may signal the potential onset of a more significant influenza season that could strain healthcare resources if the trend continues. The largest absolute increase in ILI cases has occurred in the most recent week, which warrants close monitoring and could necessitate increased healthcare preparedness, including vaccination and public health messaging. Finally, the age distribution of ILI cases underscores the importance of focusing preventive health measures on young and school-aged populations to mitigate the spread of influenza.
