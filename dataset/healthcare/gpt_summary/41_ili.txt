Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a gradual increase in the percentage of patients presenting with influenza-like illnesses (ILI), culminating in the most recent weeks where the ILI ratio has surpassed the baseline threshold of 2.9%. This upward trend is most pronounced in the age groups 5-24 and 25-49, suggesting a heightened spread of ILI among younger to middle-aged populations. The oldest age group (65 or more) has shown a steady, but less dramatic increase in ILI cases, which could still pose significant risks given their potential for more severe illness. The highest surge in ILI ratios in recent weeks suggests the onset of a more intense phase of the influenza season, which may lead to increased healthcare demands, including potential strain on resources such as hospital beds, medication, and healthcare personnel. It is critical for healthcare systems to monitor these trends closely and prepare for continued increases in ILI cases, which may necessitate public health interventions to mitigate spread and impact.
