Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have shown slight fluctuations while generally maintaining a steady range, indicative of stable weather conditions without any extreme changes. Humidity levels have remained very high throughout the period, consistently at or near saturation, suggesting a likelihood of fog or mist, especially during the early hours. Air pressure has been gradually declining, which could signal an approaching weather system that might lead to changes in the current conditions. Wind speeds have been light to moderate but have shown a gradual increase over the period, with the wind direction shifting predominantly to a westerly component, which is typical for the coastal climate of San Francisco. The combination of high humidity, decreasing air pressure, and increasing wind speed may suggest the potential for cloudier skies and the possibility of precipitation in the near future.
