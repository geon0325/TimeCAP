Over the last 24 hours in New York City, temperatures have exhibited a gradual increase during the daytime, reaching a peak in the late afternoon before declining again towards the evening. Humidity levels started moderate but significantly spiked, indicating potential early morning fog or mist, then decreased markedly as the day progressed, suggesting drier air moving into the area. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with a slight increase, indicative of settled weather conditions and no immediate signs of significant weather disturbances. Wind speeds were light and mostly consistent, with minimal variation, which would not have contributed to any substantial wind chill effect on the perceived temperature. The wind direction varied, with a general shift from westerly to northerly and then to variable directions, which could suggest a change in the weather pattern, possibly due to a passing front or localized pressure changes.
