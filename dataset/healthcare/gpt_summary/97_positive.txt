Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a significant upward trend in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a notable increase from 1.34% in week 1 to 25.39% in week 20, surpassing the average positive ratio of 6.26%. Influenza A has been the dominant strain throughout the period, with its incidence rising sharply from 0.82% to 21.62% of tested specimens, while Influenza B also showed an increase but to a lesser extent, going from 0.53% to 3.77%. The peak positive percentage for both strains occurred in the final week, indicating that the influenza season is likely at its height or continuing to escalate. This trend suggests a substantial burden on healthcare resources, with a potential increase in hospitalizations, demand for antiviral medications, and the necessity for public health interventions to manage the spread. Considering this data, healthcare systems should be advised to bolster their readiness for continued or increased influenza activity in the coming weeks.
