Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has experienced volatility with a downward trend, slipping from a high of 4176.82 to a closing figure of 3900.11, which indicates a bearish sentiment in the US equity market. The VIX, commonly referred to as the "fear index," has shown increased volatility, peaking at 34.02, which correlates with the larger drops in the S&P 500, suggesting heightened market uncertainty. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 have also faced declines, with the Nikkei dropping from 26781.68 to 26871.27 and the FTSE 100 from 7585.50 to 7258.30, reflecting a global risk-off mood.

Commodity prices have been mixed; while Gold Futures have seen a slight decrease from 1851.30 to 1820.90, signaling a potential shift away from safe-haven assets, Crude Oil Futures have fluctuated but ended at a higher price of 109.57 from the starting 115.07, possibly due to geopolitical tensions or supply concerns. Exchange rate movements have seen the Euro weakening against the US dollar, moving from 1.07 to 1.06 EUR/USD, and the Japanese Yen has depreciated from 127.04 to 135.06 USD/JPY, both of which may impact international trade balances and earnings of multinational companies.
