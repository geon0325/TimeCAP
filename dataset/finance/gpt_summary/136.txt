Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with a clear downward trend, closing lower by approximately 5.2% from 2995.11 to 2840.60, which could indicate growing investor unease. The VIX, also known as the Fear Index, has increased significantly from 13.53 to 22.10, reflecting heightened market volatility and investor anxiety. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have also faced pressures, with the Nikkei seeing a modest decline and the FTSE 100 experiencing a more pronounced drop, which suggests a broader global market uncertainty. Gold Futures have risen from 1426.10 to 1515.90, a growth of around 6.3%, implying a flight to safety as investors seek more stable assets. Meanwhile, exchange rates for major currencies against the USD have remained relatively stable, with minor fluctuations, indicating that currency markets have not yet reacted as strongly to the volatility seen in equity and commodities markets.
