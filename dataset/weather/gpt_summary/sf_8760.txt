Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature with a general cooling trend during the nighttime before rising again towards the latter part of the observed period. Humidity levels were relatively high and showed a significant increase during the night, reaching near saturation, which suggests the possibility of fog or mist formation, especially during the early hours. Atmospheric pressure remained notably stable and high after a slight variation, indicating steady weather conditions and a high likelihood of continued fair weather. Wind speeds were consistently light, suggesting a calm weather pattern with little to no wind-related disturbances. The wind direction varied but predominantly came from the west, which is typical for San Francisco due to its coastal location and could contribute to the maintenance of moderate temperatures due to the influence of the nearby ocean.
