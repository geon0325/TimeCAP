Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have shown slight fluctuations but generally maintained a warm profile indicative of mild to warm conditions throughout the day and night. Relative humidity levels have varied, with a trend towards higher values during the night and early morning hours, suggesting a likelihood of muggy conditions that could potentially lead to discomfort or the formation of fog. Air pressure remained relatively stable, indicating a period without significant weather fronts or storms affecting the area. Wind speeds were mostly light to gentle, with a slight increase towards the end of the period, which could result in a minor cooling effect and dispersion of humidity. The prevailing wind direction was predominantly from the southeast, consistent with Houston's typical wind patterns that can contribute to the transport of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico into the region.
