Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has depicted a downward trend, falling from 4140.77 to 3789.93, reflecting increased market volatility as indicated by the rise in the VIX from 22.82 to 27.99. The Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have also shown a decline, but with less steepness compared to the S&P 500, suggesting a more contained impact on the European and Asian markets. Gold Futures have decreased from 1747.80 to 1664.60, indicating that investors might be seeking riskier assets or there's a strengthening dollar, which is also reinforced by the slight upward trend in the USD/JPY exchange rate from 136.73 to 143.60, suggesting a depreciation of the Japanese yen against the dollar. The Crude Oil Futures have declined from 94.89 to 82.94, which could imply a potential easing in inflationary pressures or a response to expected lower future economic activity. Lastly, the exchange rate for EUR/USD has remained relatively stable, fluctuating around 1.00, showing a steady state in the currency pair amidst the market volatility.
