Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have experienced a noticeable drop followed by a rebound, indicating a transient cool period before returning to more stable conditions. Humidity levels have shown significant variation, with notably higher values during the cooler period, suggesting the presence of moisture that could result in fog, especially in coastal and low-lying areas. Air pressure remained fairly stable throughout the period, which typically suggests consistent weather patterns without the immediate approach of significant weather fronts. Wind speeds were mostly light, with little fluctuation, which could lead to stagnant air conditions that might affect air quality. The wind direction shifted considerably from westerly to northerly and eventually to calm conditions, often associated with the passage of a weather system and the settling of the atmosphere afterward.
