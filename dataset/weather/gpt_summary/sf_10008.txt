Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have exhibited a mild fluctuation with a general cooling trend, particularly noticeable during the late-night to early morning hours, which is typical for coastal cities. Humidity levels have seen moderate variation, starting relatively low but increasing as the temperature decreased, suggesting a possible increase in coastal moisture or the influence of marine air. Air pressure has been steadily increasing, indicative of a stable or improving weather pattern, likely leading to clearer skies and less chance of precipitation. Wind speeds have remained consistently light, which could lead to the accumulation of pollutants in the air due to the lack of dispersion. Wind direction has been variable but predominantly coming from the northwest, which is characteristic of the prevailing winds in this region and may contribute to the moderation of temperatures due to the influence of the cold ocean currents.
