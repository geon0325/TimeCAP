Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before slightly cooling down. Humidity levels showed a decreasing trend throughout the day, which is typical as temperatures rise, and this pattern suggests a less muggy atmosphere that could contribute to more comfortable outdoor conditions. Air pressure remained remarkably stable, showing minimal fluctuation, indicating a period of stable weather without significant fronts or storms passing through the region. Wind speeds were consistently light, increasing only slightly by the end of the period, which would not have had much impact on the day-to-day activities of residents. The wind direction varied, starting from the west-southwest and gradually shifting to come from the south-southeast, which could have influenced local temperature and humidity levels slightly due to the movement of maritime air inland.
