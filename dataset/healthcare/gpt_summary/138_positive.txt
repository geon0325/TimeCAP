Over the last 20 weeks, there has been an upward trend in the number of respiratory specimens tested for influenza, with a noticeable increase from 10,789 to 18,035 tests. Despite this increase in testing, the overall ratio of positive specimens has remained relatively stable, with a slight increase from 1.53% to 1.70%, and is still below the 20-week average of 6.26%. Notably, Influenza A has shown a consistent presence with the ratio of positive specimens increasing from 0.70% to 1.24%, whereas Influenza B has demonstrated more variability, starting and ending the period at similar levels (0.82% to 0.46%) but dipping to as low as 0.19% in the interim. The highest ratio of positive specimens for both Influenza A and B occurred in week 19 with 1.32% and 0.43%, respectively. This data suggests a sustained but controlled circulation of influenza, with Influenza A being the more prevalent strain, which could inform healthcare providers to remain vigilant and possibly adjust resource allocation for testing and treatment accordingly.
