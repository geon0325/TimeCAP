Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with a notable drop in the middle of the period, followed by a partial recovery, ending slightly below its starting point, suggesting a degree of investor uncertainty. The VIX, or Volatility Index, has correspondingly fluctuated, with spikes indicating increased market volatility, particularly when the S&P 500 experienced its steepest declines. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 have both trended downwards, which may reflect broader global market concerns, potentially compounded by economic indicators or geopolitical tensions. Gold Futures have risen, indicating a flight to safety by investors amidst market uncertainty, while Crude Oil Futures have been relatively more stable with slight upward movement, showing some resilience in commodity markets. Exchange rates have seen the USD weaken against the JPY, suggesting a risk-off sentiment among investors, while the USD/CNY increase may point towards concerns over trade tensions or weakening confidence in emerging market currencies.
