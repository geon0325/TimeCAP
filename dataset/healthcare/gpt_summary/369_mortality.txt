Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a fluctuating but overall decreasing trend in the mortality ratio of Influenza or Pneumonia against the total number of deaths, starting at 7.54% and ending at 6.25%, with a notable dip to 5.70% in week 13. Despite the overall decline, the mortality ratio remains below the historical average of 7.84%, suggesting a better control or management of these conditions in the recent weeks. The total number of deaths peaked at the beginning of the time series, with a significant drop in week 13, followed by a rebound in subsequent weeks, indicating possible seasonal effects or other epidemiological factors at play. The absolute number of deaths from both Influenza and Pneumonia has also shown a downward trend, which coincides with the decrease in the total number of deaths. This data could suggest that healthcare interventions and public health measures are having a positive impact, but continuous monitoring is essential, especially considering potential variables such as vaccine efficacy, healthcare resources, and emerging viral strains.
