Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures exhibited a typical diurnal pattern, with a peak during the daytime and a drop at night, remaining within comfortable ranges. Humidity levels varied significantly, indicating the presence of different air masses affecting the region, with particularly low humidity during the day which could have increased the risk of fire spread if any ignition sources were present. Air pressure showed minor fluctuations but stayed relatively stable, suggesting no immediate approach of significant weather systems. Wind speeds ranged from calm to moderate throughout the period, with moments of higher gusts that could have affected small watercraft on the bay or light outdoor structures. The wind direction changed throughout the day, primarily blowing from a southerly direction, shifting towards westerly later, which is typical for coastal areas influenced by sea breezes and land heating patterns.
