Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown an overall upward trend, increasing from 3215.57 to 3380.35, indicative of investor confidence and a potentially strengthening economy. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, has generally declined from 28.00 to 22.28, suggesting that market participants are experiencing less anxiety about short-term market movements. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have experienced some volatility; the Nikkei 225 dipped mid-period but recovered to 22843.96, while the FTSE 100 also showed recovery towards the end, closing at 6280.10 after some fluctuations. Gold Futures have seen considerable appreciation, starting at 1798.70 and spiking to 2031.10 before a slight retreat to 1934.90, reflecting investor hedging against potential market uncertainty and inflation concerns. Exchange rates for major currencies against the USD have been relatively stable with minor fluctuations; however, the USD has weakened slightly against the EUR and JPY, while remaining mostly stable against the CNY, which could indicate shifts in currency markets and international trade dynamics.
