Over the last 20 weeks, the data shows a gradual increase in the percentage of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) across all age groups, with the most significant rise observed among the youngest (0-4 years) and oldest (65 years or more) populations. The ratio of ILI patients has consistently escalated, surpassing the baseline threshold, which indicates a growing burden on the healthcare system and may signal an intensifying influenza season. Although the total number of patients fluctuated, there was a marked peak in the middle of the observed period, followed by a slight decrease and then another increase towards the end of the period. The consistent upward trend in ILI ratios, despite the variations in total patient numbers, suggests increased disease transmission or greater severity of cases. This trend warrants heightened surveillance and potentially increased healthcare resources to manage the rise in ILI cases effectively.
