Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a notable temperature decrease, shifting from conditions that are warmer than average to a cooler and more typical range for the region. Humidity levels have varied significantly, starting with extremely low values before rising to saturation and then oscillating between high and slightly lower percentages, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air that could lead to fog or low clouds, particularly in coastal areas. Air pressure has remained relatively stable, indicating that no significant weather fronts are passing through the area that would cause abrupt weather changes. Wind speeds have been generally light to moderate with a couple of instances of calmer conditions, and the wind direction has been variable with a general tendency from the northwest, which is typical for San Francisco's climate. This combination of stable pressure, high humidity, and gentle winds from the ocean is likely to result in cool, foggy mornings followed by clearer but still cool afternoons.
