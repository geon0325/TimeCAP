Over the last 24 hours, New York City experienced a gradual decline in temperature, reaching a minimum in the early morning before steadily rising later in the day. Humidity levels were variable, peaking at saturation during the night and early morning hours, which could have led to foggy conditions, before dropping significantly during the day, indicating a drier atmosphere. Air pressure saw a notable dip before stabilizing and maintaining consistently high values, suggesting the passing of a transient weather system and the establishment of more stable conditions. Wind speeds were generally light, with occasional moderate gusts, and the wind direction varied significantly, implying a changing weather pattern and potential for shifts in temperature and precipitation. The combination of high humidity, varying wind directions, and the stabilization of air pressure could result in clear but potentially brisk weather conditions for the immediate future.
