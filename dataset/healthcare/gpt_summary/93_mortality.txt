Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia in comparison to the average ratio of 7.84%, with a low of 6.01% in week 6 and a peak of 8.33% in week 11. The total number of deaths has shown an increasing trend, starting at 52,228 in week 1 and reaching 57,957 in week 20. Despite the total death count increasing, the number of deaths caused by Influenza has seen a more than 18-fold increase, from 28 in week 1 to 516 in week 20, while deaths from Pneumonia have also risen but less sharply, from 3,156 to 3,758. The ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia hit its highest at 8.33% in week 11, surpassing the 20-week average, and has remained above the overall average in the subsequent weeks, indicating a potential seasonal surge or an outbreak. These trends suggest a significant burden on the healthcare system, with a need for increased vigilance and resources allocated to respiratory disease management and prevention efforts as the mortality from these conditions constitutes a growing proportion of total deaths.
