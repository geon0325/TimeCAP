Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, peaking during the late afternoon hours, which is typical for the diurnal temperature cycle. The humidity levels showed significant variation, with notably lower humidity coinciding with the highest temperatures of the day, suggesting an inverse relationship between temperature and humidity during this period. Air pressure remained relatively stable with only minor fluctuations, indicating a lack of strong weather systems moving through the area. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate but increased towards the end of the period, which could potentially bring changes to the current weather patterns. The wind direction varied, with a tendency to shift from northerly to westerly, and then predominantly northwesterly, which is common for coastal cities like San Francisco and can influence the distribution of coastal fog and marine conditions.
