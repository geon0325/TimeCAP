Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with a general downward trend, declining from a high of 4459.45 to 4088.85, reflecting investor concerns over economic conditions. The VIX, known as the "fear index," has increased overall, suggesting that market volatility has heightened, with a peak at 34.75 before a slight decrease to 26.10, which aligns with the observed fluctuations in the S&P 500. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 have also experienced declines, although the FTSE 100 has shown some resilience with a recent uptick to 7518.40, indicating some regional variations in market sentiment. Commodity prices have been mixed, with Gold Futures seeing a slight decrease from 1952.30 to 1818.20, while Crude Oil Futures have experienced an uptrend, moving from 102.75 to 112.40, which could indicate concerns over supply or expectations of rising demand. Currency markets have shown a strengthening of the US dollar, as evidenced by the appreciation against the Euro (from 1.08 to 1.04 EUR/USD) and the Japanese Yen (from 129.33 to 128.92 USD/JPY), while remaining stable against the Chinese Yuan (6.39 to 6.79 USD/CNY), which may impact international trade dynamics and could suggest a flight to the perceived safety of the dollar amidst global uncertainties.
