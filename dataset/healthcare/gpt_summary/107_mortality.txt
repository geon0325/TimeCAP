Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to total deaths has fluctuated but generally trended downwards, starting at 7.21% and ending at 5.77%, with a peak at 7.75% in the eighth week. The total number of deaths has decreased slightly during this period, with a starting point of 57,892 and ending at 53,124. Notably, deaths from influenza showed a sharp decline from 276 to 21, whereas pneumonia deaths also decreased but less dramatically, from 3,898 to 3,045. The highest recorded influenza mortality occurred in week four with 483 deaths, while pneumonia mortality was relatively consistent, staying within the 3,000 range. These trends suggest a potential easing burden on healthcare resources dedicated to respiratory illnesses, but continuous monitoring is essential to address any sudden changes in this pattern.
