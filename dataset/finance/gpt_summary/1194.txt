Over the past 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a downward trend, decreasing from a high of 4288.39 to 4137.23, which indicates a potential bearish sentiment in the market. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, has fluctuated but ended slightly higher, suggesting increased uncertainty among investors. The Nikkei 225 has also experienced a decline, reinforcing the signs of a global market retreat, while the FTSE 100 has shown a more modest decrease, possibly indicating some resilience in European markets. Gold Futures have risen, which is typical during times of market stress as investors seek safe-haven assets, alongside a slight increase in Crude Oil Futures volatility, reflecting ongoing concerns about supply and demand dynamics. The foreign exchange rates have remained relatively stable, with minor fluctuations in the EUR/USD and USD/JPY pairs, and a slight strengthening of the USD against the CNY, which could be indicative of a flight to the perceived safety of the dollar amidst global economic uncertainty.
