Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable diurnal fluctuation in temperature, starting off warmer, cooling during the early hours, and then increasing again towards the current hour. Humidity levels remained high throughout most of the day but showed a significant decrease in the latter part of the period, indicating drier air moving into the area. Air pressure experienced minor fluctuations, but a slight overall decrease was observed, which could be associated with changing weather patterns, possibly the approach of a weather front. Wind speeds varied moderately, with a peak suggesting a period of increased wind activity; however, they generally remained light to gentle. The wind direction shifted considerably throughout the day, initially coming from the southeasterly direction, then turning westerly, and finally settling into a northeasterly direction, which could suggest the passage of a weather system through the region.
