Over the last 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual rise in temperature, indicating a warming trend. Humidity levels initially varied but showed a significant increase, which could suggest the presence of increased moisture in the air, potentially leading to foggy or overcast conditions. Air pressure displayed a general decreasing trend throughout the period, which is often associated with the approach of a low-pressure system that could result in unsettled weather conditions. Wind speeds were mostly gentle to moderate, with a slight increase observed later in the period, suggesting that breezy conditions may be present. The wind direction was predominantly from the east to southeast, which is typical for coastal areas and can bring maritime air masses into the city.
