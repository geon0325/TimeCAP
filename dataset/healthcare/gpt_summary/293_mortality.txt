Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia to total deaths has shown an increasing trend, starting below the 20-week average of 7.84% and rising consistently to a peak of 13.74% in the final week. The total number of deaths has fluctuated but increased overall, with a notable spike in weeks 8 and 16 to 20, where the numbers were significantly higher than the initial weeks. Concurrently, deaths from pneumonia have increased substantially, more than doubling from 3,733 in week 1 to 10,052 in week 20, while deaths from influenza saw a more dramatic increase in the last two weeks, jumping from 58 to 152. This rise in the mortality ratio for these respiratory conditions suggests a possible outbreak or seasonal surge, placing increased demand on healthcare resources. The data indicates a critical need for heightened awareness and preparedness within the healthcare system to manage the growing impact of respiratory illnesses.
