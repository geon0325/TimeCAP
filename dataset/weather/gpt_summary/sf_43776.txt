Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have exhibited a diurnal pattern with a gradual increase during the day, peaking in the late afternoon, followed by a decrease towards the early hours of the morning. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, reaching saturation during the night and early morning hours but dropping markedly in the afternoon, suggesting the possibility of early morning fog clearing as the day progressed. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight variation, indicating a period of steady weather conditions without significant frontal activity. Wind speeds varied, with some gustier conditions, but overall they were moderate; the wind direction was predominantly westerly, a common pattern for the region that can bring in marine air and affect local temperatures. The combination of these factors suggests typical coastal weather for San Francisco, with variable fog and wind patterns that are influenced by the nearby Pacific Ocean.
