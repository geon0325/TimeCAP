Over the last 20 weeks, the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data has shown a consistent decrease in the number of patients presenting with ILI symptoms across all age groups. This trend is reflected in the overall percentage of ILI patients, which has remained well below the baseline indicator for an influenza outbreak. The most significant decrease is observed in the youngest age group (0-4 years), which traditionally is a highly vulnerable population for ILI. Despite the general decline, the healthcare system should maintain vigilance as ILI rates, though below the threshold, can fluctuate and potentially signal the onset of an outbreak. Moreover, continuous monitoring is essential to prepare for and mitigate any sudden increases in ILI cases, which could strain healthcare resources.
