Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature experienced a notable diurnal cycle, starting off warm, cooling significantly overnight, and then warming up again during the day. Humidity levels fluctuated dramatically, with a sharp increase during the coolest part of the early morning, which likely led to a feeling of mugginess or the presence of early morning fog or dew. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with only minor fluctuations that are typical in a stable weather pattern. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, increasing slightly during the day, which may have contributed to some dispersion of humidity and a more comfortable feel in the afternoon. The wind direction showed variability, predominantly coming from the north-northeast during the cooler part of the cycle, shifting to the south just after the coolest temperatures were recorded, and then veering westerly and northwesterly as the temperatures started to rise, indicating a possible change in weather systems affecting the area.
