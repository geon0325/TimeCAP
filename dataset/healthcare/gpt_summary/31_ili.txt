Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable upward trend in the ratio of ILI patients, which has recently surpassed the baseline threshold, indicating a growing prevalence of influenza-like symptoms in the patient population. This increase has been observed across all age groups, with the youngest (0-4 years) and school-aged children (5-24 years) experiencing the most significant rise in ILI incidence, which could suggest higher transmission rates among these groups. The steady climb in ILI cases among the elderly (65 years or older) is particularly concerning due to their increased vulnerability to complications from influenza. Despite the overall growth in ILI ratios, the recent weeks have shown a slight decline in the total number of patients presenting with ILI symptoms. Healthcare providers should be prepared for continued pressure on the system, including potential increases in hospitalizations and the need for targeted public health interventions, especially if the upward trend in ILI incidence continues.
