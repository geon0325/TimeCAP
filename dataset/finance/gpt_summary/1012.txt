Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 showed signs of recovery with a general upward trend, ending at 4111.08 after a low of 3892.09, suggesting growing investor confidence. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, fluctuated but ended slightly lower than it started, indicating that while uncertainty persists, it has not intensified significantly. The Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 both experienced slight increases overall, which could reflect a cautiously optimistic outlook in both the Asian and European markets. Gold futures saw a decrease in the latter part of the observed period, ending at 1866.20, which may signal a shift by investors towards riskier assets as gold typically represents a safe haven. The foreign exchange market showed the US dollar weakening against the Euro but strengthening against the Japanese Yen over the period, pointing to nuanced shifts in currency dynamics that could affect international trade balances and investment flows.
