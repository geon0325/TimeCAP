Over the last 24 hours in San Francisco, there was a gradual decline in temperature, which later saw a significant increase, suggesting a possible transition from cooler to warmer conditions as the day progressed. Humidity levels started high and showed a decreasing trend, which could be indicative of a reduction in the moisture content in the air, potentially leading to clearer skies. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with a slight increase followed by a minor decrease, indicating stable weather conditions without significant changes. Wind speeds were generally light and increased slightly towards the end of the period, which might affect the dispersion of any fog or low-lying clouds. The wind direction was predominantly from the west, with slight variations, which is typical for coastal San Francisco and can influence the temperature and fog patterns along the bay.
