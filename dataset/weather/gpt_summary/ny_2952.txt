Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a slight decrease in temperature, indicating a trend towards cooler conditions. Humidity levels have varied significantly but showed an increasing trend in the latter hours, which could lead to a perception of chillier weather or potential for fog development in the early morning hours. Air pressure has been steadily rising throughout the period, which is often associated with the arrival of more stable weather conditions and could imply clearer skies ahead. Wind speeds have been moderate with some fluctuations, maintaining enough strength to contribute to the wind chill factor, making it feel colder than the actual temperature. The wind direction has been predominantly westerly, with a gradual shift to a more northwesterly direction towards the end of the period, which is typical of cooler and drier air masses moving into the area.
