Humidity levels have fluctuated significantly, with the lowest humidity occurring during the peak afternoon temperatures and the highest during the early morning, suggesting a possible discomfort from mugginess during night and early hours. Air pressure has shown some variability with a notable increase towards the middle of the time period, which could be associated with a transient high-pressure system passing through the area.
