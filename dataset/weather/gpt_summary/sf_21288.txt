Over the past 24 hours, the temperature in San Francisco has shown a typical diurnal pattern with a gradual increase during the day, peaking in the afternoon, followed by a decrease through the evening and night. Humidity levels have remained relatively high throughout the period, with a noticeable spike towards the night and early morning hours, suggesting a likelihood of fog or mist formation, especially during the early hours when humidity reached saturation. Air pressure has been notably stable, with only slight fluctuations, indicating a period of stable weather conditions without significant fronts or storm systems affecting the area. Wind speeds have been consistently light, offering little relief from the humidity, and the wind direction has varied but primarily maintained a westerly component, which is typical for the region due to the maritime influence. The combination of high humidity, stable pressure, and light winds is conducive to cool and potentially foggy conditions, particularly during the night and early morning.
