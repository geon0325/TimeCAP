Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a noticeable downward trend in temperature, indicative of a transition from warmer daytime conditions to cooler nighttime temperatures, which is typical for the coastal climate of the region. Humidity levels experienced significant fluctuations, reaching very high levels during certain hours, which could have resulted in periods of dense fog, a common occurrence in this city. Air pressure readings varied moderately, with some sharp changes that could suggest the passage of a frontal system through the area, potentially affecting weather patterns such as wind speed and precipitation. Wind speeds remained mostly light to moderate, without any strong gusts, maintaining relatively calm conditions throughout the day. The wind direction was predominantly from the west and southwest, which is typical for San Francisco due to its geographical location and the influence of the Pacific Ocean.
