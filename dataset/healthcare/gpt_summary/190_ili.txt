The analysis of the 20-week Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data shows a fluctuating but overall increasing trend in the ratio of ILI patients, culminating in values that have recently surpassed the baseline threshold indicative of heightened influenza activity. This increase is evident across all age groups, with the most significant rise observed in the youngest (0-4 years) and the oldest (65 years and older) populations, which may suggest higher vulnerability or transmission rates in these demographics. The escalation in ILI ratio has been accompanied by a substantial surge in the absolute number of patients reporting ILI symptoms, pointing to a broader spread within the community. The peak ILI ratio observed surpasses the baseline by a significant margin, indicating an intense period of influenza that could strain healthcare resources and necessitate increased healthcare services, including hospitalizations and outpatient visits. This trend underscores the need for public health interventions, such as vaccination and infection control measures, to mitigate the impact on the healthcare system and vulnerable populations.
