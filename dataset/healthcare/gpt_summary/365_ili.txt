The data over the last 20 weeks indicates a decreasing trend in the number of patients presenting with Influenza-like Illness (ILI) across all age groups, starting from a peak above the baseline ratio to settling just below the threshold by the end of the period. The most significant decrease is observed in the youngest age group (0-4 years), suggesting potential for reduced disease transmission or improved immunity. The ratio of ILI patients, although decreasing, has consistently remained above the baseline for the majority of the period, indicating a sustained level of ILI activity within the population. The older age groups (50-64 and 65 or more) have shown less fluctuation in numbers, implying a steadier rate of infection among these demographics. Given these trends, healthcare systems should remain vigilant for potential surges in ILI cases, especially in younger populations, and continue to promote preventive measures and readiness for an increased demand for healthcare services.
