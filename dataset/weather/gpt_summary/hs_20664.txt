Over the last 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable decrease in temperature from its peak during the day to a cooler early morning level, followed by a gradual rise, indicating a typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels increased during the cooler morning hours, which is common as cooler air holds less moisture, making the air relatively more saturated. Air pressure remained relatively stable, showing only minor fluctuations within a tight range, which suggests stable weather conditions without any significant frontal systems moving through the area. Wind speeds were generally light to gentle and mostly consistent throughout the period, unlikely to contribute to any significant weather changes. The wind direction varied significantly, with a notable shift from a northerly direction to southeasterly and then easterly winds, which could bring changes in humidity and temperature as different air masses move into the region.
