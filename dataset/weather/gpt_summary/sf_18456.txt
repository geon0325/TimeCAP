Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperatures with a general cooling trend towards the early hours, followed by a modest warming towards the latter part of the day. Humidity levels remained high throughout the day, suggesting an increased likelihood of fog or mist, particularly during the cooler, early hours when humidity peaked. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a minor decreasing trend, which could indicate a gradual shift in weather patterns or the approach of a new weather system. Wind speeds were consistently light, offering little relief from the high humidity and suggesting a stagnation of air that could contribute to the build-up of urban pollution. Wind direction varied significantly throughout the period, indicating a lack of a dominant weather front and the potential for variable weather conditions in the short term.
