Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, a slight uptrend in temperature was observed, indicating a mild warming trend that could influence conditions to feel slightly warmer today. The humidity levels showed a gradual decrease throughout the period, suggesting a potential for drier air that could be more comfortable for residents and visitors. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable but showed a slight decrease towards the end of the observed period, which could hint at an approaching change in weather patterns, possibly leading to increased cloudiness or a change in wind patterns.

The wind direction was predominantly from the west-southwest, which is typical for the region and may contribute to the coastal climate's characteristic cool breezes.
