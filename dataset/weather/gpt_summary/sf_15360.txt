Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, with a notable dip during the early hours, which slightly recovered as the day progressed. The humidity levels showed a significant peak coinciding with the temperature drop, reaching saturation, which suggests the possibility of fog or mist formation during that time. Air pressure varied but showed an overall stable trend towards the latter part of the period, indicating relatively stable weather conditions without significant frontal changes. Wind speeds were generally light with a slight increase towards the end of the observation period, while wind direction shifted predominantly from southerly to southeasterly directions, implying a potential shift in weather patterns. The combination of high humidity, stable pressure, and light winds could have led to calm and possibly foggy conditions, especially during the night and early morning.
