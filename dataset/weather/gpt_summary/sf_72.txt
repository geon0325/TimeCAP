Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature, with a cooling trend during the early hours followed by a gradual warming. Humidity levels varied considerably, with peaks suggesting the presence of more moisture in the air during certain periods, which could lead to morning or evening fog, a common occurrence in the region. Air pressure saw some instability with significant fluctuations, which might be indicative of changing weather patterns or the passage of a weather front through the area. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with some calm periods, and the wind direction shifted throughout the day, suggesting the movement of different air masses over the city. These conditions, combined with the local topography and marine influence, could result in microclimates and variable weather experiences throughout San Francisco.
