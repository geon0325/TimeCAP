Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has demonstrated a general upward trend, indicative of warming conditions moving into the area. Relative humidity has seen a gradual decrease, which, combined with rising temperatures, suggests a drier and more comfortable atmospheric state developing. Atmospheric pressure has remained relatively stable, with a slight downward trend noted, which may imply a potential for changing weather patterns, possibly leading to increasing cloudiness or chances of precipitation in the near future. Wind speeds have been moderate without significant fluctuations, maintaining a gentle to fresh breeze throughout the day. The wind direction has been predominantly from the south-southwest, which is typical for this region and may contribute to the transport of moisture and warmer air from the Gulf of Mexico into Houston.
