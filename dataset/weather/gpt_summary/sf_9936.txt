Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have remained relatively steady with a slight fluctuation, indicative of stable weather conditions typical for the region's microclimate. Humidity levels have been consistently high, nearing saturation, which could have led to a misty atmosphere and potentially low visibility conditions at times. Air pressure has shown a gradual declining trend, which might suggest an approaching weather system that could bring changes such as increased wind speed or precipitation. Wind conditions have been remarkably calm with both wind speed and direction remaining constant, suggesting a period of tranquility in the local weather pattern. The combination of high humidity, declining pressure, and calm winds could signal the potential for fog formation, particularly in areas near the coast and bay.
