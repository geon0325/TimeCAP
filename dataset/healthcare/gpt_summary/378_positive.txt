Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable decline in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for Influenza A, dropping from an initial high of 8.49% to a low of 0.40%, indicating a significant decrease in prevalence. In contrast, Influenza B has shown an opposite trend, with its positivity rate steadily increasing from 0.13% to 0.78%, suggesting a shift in the dominant influenza strain circulating in the population. Despite these trends, the overall positivity rate for influenza has decreased from a peak of 8.61% to 1.18%, which is still above the average ratio of 6.26% reported, potentially indicating persistent but reduced influenza activity. This overall decline in positivity rates could suggest that public health interventions are effective or that the influenza season is waning. However, the healthcare system should remain vigilant, as the uptick in Influenza B could lead to a surge in cases, necessitating continued monitoring and resource allocation for testing and treatment.
