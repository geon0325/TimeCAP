Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a general upward trend, reaching a peak on the 15th day, but experienced a significant drop by the 20th day, indicating increased market volatility. This volatility is corroborated by the VIX, which remained relatively low and stable for the first 15 days but spiked sharply towards the end of the period, suggesting growing investor anxiety. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 experienced similar fluctuations with an overall decline, particularly noticeable for the FTSE 100 with a sharp drop at the end. Gold Futures prices remained relatively stable, showing a slight increase, which may be indicative of investors seeking safe-haven assets amidst market uncertainty. The exchange rates of EUR/USD and USD/JPY showed little variation, while USD/CNY experienced a slight increase, potentially reflecting the impact of trade tensions on currency valuations.
