Over the last 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before slowly tapering off. Despite the rising temperatures, there has been a significant decrease in humidity, suggesting drier air is moving into the area. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day with only minor fluctuations, indicating a steady atmospheric condition. Wind speeds varied, with occasional gusts; however, they generally remained moderate. The wind direction was predominantly from the northwest, with some variations, which could have contributed to the decrease in humidity and the transport of cooler, drier air into the city.
