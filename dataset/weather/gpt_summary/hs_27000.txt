Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced relatively stable temperatures with a slight cooling trend, which is typical for diurnal variation. Humidity levels have varied significantly, reaching saturation at some points, which could indicate the presence of fog or mist, particularly when coupled with the stable temperatures observed. Air pressure has shown an increasing trend in the latter part of the period, suggesting the potential for improving weather conditions or the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds have remained mostly light, with a notable shift in wind direction from northerly to easterly and then swinging to a southerly and westerly direction before returning to a northerly flow, which could be associated with the passage of a weather front. Overall, these conditions may lead to a cloudy or overcast sky with chances of morning fog or mist clearing up as the day progresses, influenced by the light wind and stabilizing air pressure.
