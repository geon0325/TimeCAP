Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a gradual increase in temperature, indicating a warming trend that peaked during the later hours. Humidity levels started relatively moderate but increased significantly overnight, maintaining very high levels before decreasing slightly, suggesting potential for muggy conditions that eased somewhat by the end of the period. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, indicating a period of steady weather without significant front movements. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with a slight increase observed towards the end of the review period, which could contribute to a slight relief from the higher humidity levels. Wind direction was predominantly from the south to south-east, which is typical for Houston and can bring in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, contributing to the observed humidity.
