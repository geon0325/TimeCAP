Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 demonstrated a general uptrend, closing higher by approximately 1.16% from 3078.27 to 3113.87, which may indicate sustained investor confidence in the stability and growth prospects of U.S. equities. The VIX, commonly referred to as the "fear index," fluctuated but ended the period notably higher, spiking to 14.91 from an initial 12.83, suggesting an increase in market volatility and potential investor anxiety. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 showed resilience with an overall increase, closing up by approximately 2.97%, while the FTSE 100 experienced a modest decline of around 1.14%, potentially reflecting region-specific economic sentiments and uncertainties. Gold Futures saw marginal fluctuations but remained relatively stable, closing slightly lower at 1462.30, which may indicate that investors are not rushing to safe-haven assets despite the uptick in volatility. The modest depreciation of the EUR/USD and the stability of USD/JPY and USD/CNY exchange rates suggest that the U.S. dollar maintained its strength against major currencies, which can impact international trade dynamics and foreign investment flows.
