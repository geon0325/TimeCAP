Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the latter part of the timeframe, indicating a typical trend of warming throughout the day. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with periods of very high humidity that could have contributed to a muggy feeling, especially when combined with the higher temperatures. The air pressure showed variability with a notable increase mid-timeframe, which may have been associated with a transient high-pressure system moving through the area. Wind speeds were mostly moderate and consistent, with slight variations that are not indicative of any major wind events. Wind direction remained predominantly from the south to southeast, which is common for Houston and can contribute to the transport of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico into the region, affecting the local humidity levels.
