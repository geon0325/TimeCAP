Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before slightly cooling down. Humidity levels varied significantly, with a notable increase during the early morning hours indicative of possible morning dew or mist, followed by a decrease towards the afternoon as temperatures rose. Air pressure showed a slight but steady decline throughout the period, which could suggest an approaching weather system or front. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with occasional gusts, and the wind direction shifted from predominantly southwesterly to southerly, then to more easterly and northeasterly directions towards the end of the period. These conditions, particularly the lowering air pressure and varying wind directions, could be indicative of changing weather patterns, possibly leading to unsettled weather in the near future.
