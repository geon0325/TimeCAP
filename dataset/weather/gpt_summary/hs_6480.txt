Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before stabilizing slightly above the day's average during the night. Humidity levels have shown a notable decrease as the temperature rose, suggesting a typical diurnal pattern where warmer temperatures lead to lower relative humidity. Air pressure has been decreasing overall, indicating the potential development of a low-pressure system which could lead to unsettled weather conditions. Wind speeds remained generally low to moderate throughout the period, with some calm intervals, and wind directions have varied significantly, suggesting an absence of a dominant weather front. The shift in wind direction from southerly to northwesterly and then stabilizing from the west could be associated with the passage of a weather system through the area.
