Over the past 20 weeks, the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia to the total number of deaths has shown significant fluctuation when compared to the average ratio of 7.84%. Initially, the ratio was slightly above the average, with values such as 8.01% and 8.16%, but it then decreased to a low of 5.20% by the third week. Notably, there was a sharp increase in the ratio during the last five weeks, peaking at 19.40% in the 16th week, which is more than double the average ratio, indicating a possible outbreak or increased severity of these illnesses. The total number of deaths reached its highest in the 16th week (86,888), coinciding with the peak in the Influenza or Pneumonia death ratio, suggesting a significant impact on overall mortality during that period. The data indicates a critical situation that may require immediate public health attention to address the underlying causes of this spike and mitigate future risks.
