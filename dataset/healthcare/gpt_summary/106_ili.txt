Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates that the prevalence of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) has experienced a notable decrease following an initial phase of high activity. The percentage of ILI patients has consistently declined, starting above the baseline and eventually descending below it, suggesting a decrease in influenza activity. Age-specific ILI incidences show that the highest numbers were reported in the youngest (0-4 years) and school-age (5-24 years) groups, with these groups also reflecting a similar downward trend in the latter weeks. The sustained decline in ILI cases across all age groups is likely to alleviate the pressures on healthcare resources experienced during the peak of ILI activity. However, continuous monitoring remains essential to anticipate any potential resurgence and to ensure healthcare systems are prepared for future increases in ILI cases.
