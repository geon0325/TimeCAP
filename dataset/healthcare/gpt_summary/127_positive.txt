Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a declining trend in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for both Influenza A and B, with the combined positive ratio decreasing from a peak of 15.58% to 1.00% in the most recent week. Influenza B has been more prevalent than Influenza A throughout the period, but its incidence has seen a steeper decline, dropping from 9.20% to 0.28%. The ratio of positive specimens for Influenza A has also decreased, though less dramatically, from 6.38% to 0.71%. The overall reduction in influenza activity suggests a decreasing burden on the healthcare system regarding influenza cases. However, continued monitoring is essential to prepare for potential future surges and to manage resources effectively for diagnostics and treatment.
