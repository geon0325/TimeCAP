Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable decrease in the total number of deaths, dropping from 72,145 to 63,511. However, the proportion of those deaths attributable to influenza and pneumonia has shown fluctuations with an initial increase, reaching a peak ratio of 15.78% in the second week, before declining and then ascending again to 10.72% by the 19th week, and finally decreasing slightly to 10.25% in the last week. Despite the overall reduction in total deaths, the number of deaths from pneumonia remains significantly higher than those from influenza, indicating pneumonia as a more substantial contributor to the mortality rate within this category. The average ratio of mortality due to influenza or pneumonia across the 20 weeks is 11.25%, which is higher than the provided average ratio of 7.84%, suggesting a period of heightened impact from these illnesses. This trend could signal a strain on healthcare resources dedicated to respiratory illnesses and may necessitate continued monitoring and response strategies to manage the higher than average impact of these diseases.
