Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a progressive increase in the incidence of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) across all age groups, with the most notable rise observed in patients aged 5-24 and 25-49. This uptick has been reflected in the overall ratio of ILI patients, which has escalated steadily, surpassing the baseline threshold of 2.9% in recent weeks. The age group 0-4 consistently reported the highest numbers of ILI cases, suggesting a heightened vulnerability or increased transmission within this demographic. Despite this, in the most recent weeks, there has been a slight decrease in the ratio of ILI patients, hinting at a potential stabilization or downward trend in ILI activity. Healthcare systems should be aware of the sustained increase over the baseline, as it may indicate a need for additional resources and preventative measures, particularly targeting the most affected age groups.
