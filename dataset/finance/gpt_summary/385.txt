Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a consistent upward trend, closing higher by 5.1% from 3197.52 to 3360.47, which suggests a positive sentiment among investors despite ongoing uncertainties. The VIX, or Volatility Index, has decreased from 29.52 to 22.13, indicating a reduction in market volatility and increased investor confidence. In contrast, international indices like the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 have experienced more volatility, with the Nikkei 225 showing minor fluctuations and a slight decline, and the FTSE 100 demonstrating a more pronounced drop, especially amid a dip to 5897.80, before partially recovering. Gold Futures have seen a significant increase, rising from 1810.60 to 2024.40, reflecting investors' hedging against potential market risks and inflation concerns. Currency markets show the Euro strengthening against the US Dollar, moving from 1.13 to 1.18, while the USD/CNY pair has seen minor fluctuations, ending marginally lower, which may suggest a slight depreciation of the dollar in currency markets.
