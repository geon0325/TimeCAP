Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the later hours, indicative of a typical diurnal pattern with warmer conditions prevailing by afternoon. Concurrently, humidity levels showed significant fluctuation, initially high during the cooler morning hours and subsequently decreasing as temperatures rose, suggesting an inverse relationship between temperature and humidity during this period. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase in the middle of the time series, which could be associated with transient weather systems passing through the area. Wind speeds varied, with a notable increase followed by a decrease towards the end of the period, which could influence the dispersion of humidity and other atmospheric conditions. The wind direction shifted dramatically from predominantly southerly to northerly and then veered again, indicating the passage of a frontal system through Houston that could have been responsible for the observed variability in the weather conditions.
