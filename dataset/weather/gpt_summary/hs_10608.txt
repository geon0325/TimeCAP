Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual increase in temperature during the day with a peak in the afternoon, followed by a slight decrease towards the evening, indicative of typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with notably high humidity in the early morning hours, which decreased markedly during the afternoon before rising again in the evening, suggesting the presence of moisture that could lead to morning fog or dew. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with a slight decrease noted in the late evening hours, which could signal an approaching weather system or front. Wind speeds were generally light and variable, with a slight increase in the afternoon, which is common in coastal regions like Houston due to sea breeze effects. The predominant wind direction was from the north-northeast, except for a noticeable shift to southerly and easterly directions in the afternoon, potentially influencing local temperature and humidity levels.
