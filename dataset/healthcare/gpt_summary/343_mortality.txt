Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable increase in the percentage of deaths attributed to influenza or pneumonia, rising from a starting point of 5.27% to a peak of 9.03%, significantly above the average ratio of 7.84%. The total number of deaths fluctuated but showed an upward trend, peaking in the 19th week with 67,000 deaths, before a slight decrease in the 20th week. Notably, deaths from influenza saw a sharp increase starting from the 13th week, escalating rapidly and contributing to the overall rise in the influenza or pneumonia mortality ratio. Pneumonia deaths also increased steadily, compounding the impact on the mortality ratio. This trend suggests a growing burden on healthcare resources and could indicate a need for increased preventative measures and healthcare system preparedness to manage respiratory illnesses.
