Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature throughout the day, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before beginning to cool down slightly at night. Humidity levels showed significant variation, with notably higher humidity during the early morning hours, which then decreased as temperatures rose, suggesting a possible correlation between temperature and moisture in the air. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight decreasing trend towards the latter part of the day, which could be indicative of a changing weather system approaching the area. Wind speeds were mostly moderate but showed some variability, with occasional increases that could contribute to a sense of cooler conditions, particularly when humidity levels were lower. The prevailing wind direction was predominantly from the north, shifting slightly throughout the day, which is typical for the region and may have influenced the temperature and humidity patterns observed.
