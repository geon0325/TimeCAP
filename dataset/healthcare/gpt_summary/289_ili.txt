Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a steady increase in the ratio of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) patients, surpassing the baseline level in recent weeks. This trend is consistent across all age groups, with the most significant uptick in ILI cases observed in the 25-49 and 50-64 age brackets. Despite fluctuations, the youngest (0-4 years) and oldest (65 years or more) populations have also shown an upward trajectory in ILI incidence. The overall number of patients has varied, with some weeks experiencing higher patient counts, potentially indicating seasonal or other epidemiological factors influencing healthcare utilization. The growing proportion of ILI patients suggests a heightened demand for healthcare resources, emphasizing the need for adequate preparedness in addressing ILI cases and possible strain on healthcare systems.
