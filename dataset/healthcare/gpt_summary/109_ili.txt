Over the last 20 weeks, the data reflects a notable decline in the number of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases across all age groups, with the proportion of ILI patients decreasing to below the baseline threshold of 2.9%. The most significant reduction in ILI cases is observed among the age groups 5-24 and 0-4, which typically represent a considerable portion of the ILI patients. Despite the overall decline, the ratio of ILI patients remains at its highest in the oldest age group (65 or more), indicating a potentially higher risk or severity for the elderly population. The consistent downward trend suggests a diminishing burden on the healthcare system concerning ILI, which may allow for reallocation of resources to other pressing health concerns. However, vigilance is required as the ILI ratio is still above the baseline in the initial weeks of the dataset, indicating potential for seasonal fluctuations or episodic increases that may necessitate preparedness for future ILI surges.
