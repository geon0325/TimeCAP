Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual decline in temperature through the early morning hours, reaching its lowest point, followed by a steady rise peaking in the late afternoon. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with notable increases during the night that tapered off during the day, potentially contributing to periods of morning fog and clearer conditions by afternoon. Air pressure showed general stability, but with a sharp decrease in the later hours, suggesting the possible approach of a weather system that could bring changes such as increased wind or precipitation. Wind speed varied from calm to moderate breezes, with a couple of instances of higher gusts, and wind direction shifted from predominantly westerly to a more variable pattern, including a brief period of easterly winds. These conditions, combined with the recent pressure drop, indicate that San Francisco may be on the cusp of a changing weather pattern, warranting further monitoring for any potential incoming weather fronts.
