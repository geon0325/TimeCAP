Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature after reaching its peak, indicating a typical diurnal pattern with cooler temperatures during the early morning hours and a warm-up throughout the day. The humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, reaching full saturation at certain points, which likely contributed to a sense of mugginess and may have been associated with fog or dew formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight increase towards the latter part of the period, which could suggest a gradual change in weather patterns or the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds varied modestly but showed a notable increase in the final hours, possibly signaling an incoming weather front or system. Finally, the wind direction was predominantly from the east to southeast, with some variability, which is typical for coastal regions like Houston and can influence local weather conditions including temperature and humidity.
