Over the past day in San Francisco, temperatures have shown a typical diurnal cycle with a warm peak in the late afternoon and a cool nadir in the early morning hours. Humidity levels have remained relatively high throughout the day but started to decrease slightly towards the evening, which could be indicative of less cloud cover and drier conditions. Atmospheric pressure experienced a significant fluctuation, decreasing notably during the evening, which may suggest the passing of a weather front or the development of a low-pressure system in the area. Wind speeds varied, with some gusty conditions observed, particularly towards the latter part of the day, which could have implications for maritime activities and cooler wind chill effects. The wind direction was variable, with a notable shift from northerly to westerly and then easterly directions, possibly influenced by local topography and the movement of weather systems around the city.
