Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable increase in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, starting at 5.55% and rising to a peak of 9.15%, before slightly decreasing to 9.07%. This upward trend exceeds the average ratio of 7.84%, indicating a significant rise in deaths attributable to these illnesses. The data exhibits a stark increase in deaths from Influenza starting from week 14, with a notable jump from 258 to 429 deaths, and continuing to rise, reaching 1048 by week 16. Pneumonia-related deaths also show a consistent rise, escalating from 3111 to 5428 deaths over the 20-week period. The growing mortality rates from these respiratory conditions suggest an increased burden on healthcare resources and may warrant a public health response to address the rise in cases and to manage the strain on the healthcare system.
