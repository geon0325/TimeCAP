Over the course of the last 20 weeks, the incidence of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) has shown a marked increase, with the percentage of ILI patients rising above the baseline in recent weeks, indicating a significant uptrend in flu activity. Notably, the steepest rise was seen in the youngest age group (0-4 years), where the number of ILI patients surged, suggesting higher vulnerability or exposure among this demographic. The data also reflects a substantial increase in ILI cases among adults aged 25-49 and 50-64, which could imply a broader impact on the workforce. This escalation has ramifications for the healthcare system, potentially leading to increased hospital visits, a need for additional medical resources, and heightened importance of vaccination and preventive measures. The elevated ratio of ILI patients in the latest weeks demands urgent attention from public health officials to mitigate the spread and impact of influenza.
