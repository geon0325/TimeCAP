Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have been relatively stable with a slight fluctuation noted, indicative of a typical diurnal pattern with cooler temperatures in the early hours followed by a gradual increase towards the afternoon. Humidity levels experienced significant variation, reaching saturation at one point, which could have been associated with fog or mist, particularly prevalent in coastal areas like San Francisco. Air pressure showed signs of variability, but ended roughly where it started, suggesting that there were no major weather systems moving through the area that would cause significant atmospheric pressure changes. Wind speeds were mostly moderate, with occasional higher gusts, and wind direction varied significantly throughout the period, suggesting changing weather patterns and the possible influence of local topography on wind flow. These conditions, when combined, paint a picture of typical San Francisco weather, with no extreme events or significant disturbances observed in the last day.
