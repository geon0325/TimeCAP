Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with an initial decline followed by a rebound, peaking at 3998.95 before retreating to 3921.05, indicating potential uncertainty in the market. The VIX, which measures market volatility, mirrored this movement with a decrease from highs of 28.36 to lows of 23.03 and closing slightly higher at 24.69, suggesting that investor anxiety has not fully abated. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have both experienced fluctuations but closed the period relatively flat, which may indicate a cautious outlook on global economic conditions. Commodity prices have also been unstable, with Gold Futures dropping to a low of 1702.40 before making a slight recovery, and Crude Oil Futures experiencing a significant decline from 111.76 to 94.98, reflecting potential concerns over global demand. Currency markets show the Euro (EUR/USD) stabilizing around 1.02 after a slight drop, while the Japanese Yen (USD/JPY) has seen a gradual appreciation against the Dollar, and the Chinese Yuan (USD/CNY) has remained relatively stable, suggesting shifts in currency strengths that could impact international trade balances.
