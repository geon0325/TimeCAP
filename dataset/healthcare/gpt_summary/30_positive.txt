Over the past 20 weeks, the data indicates a declining trend in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a peak ratio of positive specimens at 8.12% in the first week and a decrease to 1.51% by the last week. There was a significant reduction in positive cases for both Influenza A and B, with Influenza A dropping from 2.78% to 0.85% and Influenza B from 5.34% to 0.66% over the same period. Despite a decrease in the total number of specimens tested from 15,380 to 8,727, the ratio of positive cases declined more sharply than testing volume, suggesting a genuine decrease in influenza activity. The highest reduction in positive specimen ratio was observed for Influenza B, which showed a greater initial prevalence but experienced a steeper decline compared to Influenza A. This overall downward trend in influenza positivity rates is likely to reduce the burden on healthcare resources related to influenza management but warrants continuous surveillance for potential future outbreaks.
