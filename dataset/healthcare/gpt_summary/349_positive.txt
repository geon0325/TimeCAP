Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable upward trend in the ratio of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a significant increase from an average of 6.26% to a peak of 8.38% in the most recent week. Influenza A has been the predominant strain, with its ratio of positive specimens starting at 2.3% and rising sharply to 8.28%, indicating a substantial surge in cases that could strain healthcare resources. Conversely, Influenza B has remained relatively stable with a minimal increase in its ratio of positive specimens, starting at 0.06% and inching up to only 0.10%. The total number of specimens tested has also increased considerably from 69,476 to 112,851 over the period, likely reflecting a higher demand for testing due to the rise in influenza cases. This upward trend in influenza positivity rates, particularly for Influenza A, may signal the need for heightened public health measures and increased readiness in healthcare settings to manage a potential influx of patients.
