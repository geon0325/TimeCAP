Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 initially exhibited a downtrend, reaching a low of 4117.37, before recovering and closing slightly lower than the starting point at 4411.55, indicating potential market volatility and investor uncertainty. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, mirrored this uncertainty with an initial increase to 21.40, followed by a decrease, ending marginally lower at 14.76, suggesting a calming of market fears towards the end of the period. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 also faced volatility; the Nikkei 225 dipped mid-period but closed higher at 32585.11, whereas the FTSE 100 showed a more consistent decline, ending at 7425.80, which could reflect geographic-specific economic concerns. Commodity prices saw Gold Futures peaking mid-period at 1988.60 before a slight decline to 1945.50, and Crude Oil Futures dropped overall from 86.66 to 78.26, potentially indicating less inflationary pressure on the market. Currency exchange rates remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, but the USD strengthened against the JPY and CNY, ending at 151.47 and 7.18 respectively, which could have implications for trade and export dynamics.
