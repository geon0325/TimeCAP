Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a moderate fluctuation in temperature, showing a typical diurnal pattern with cooler temperatures during the early hours and a gradual warming trend as the day progressed. Humidity levels remained high throughout most of the period, which could contribute to a perception of chilliness despite the relatively stable temperatures, and may have implications for local weather phenomena such as fog, common in the area. Air pressure has been relatively steady, indicating stable weather conditions with a slight increase toward the end of the period that could signal a transient high-pressure system moving into the region. Wind speeds have varied, with periods of calm and gusts reaching moderate levels; notably, the wind direction shifted frequently, which is characteristic of coastal weather patterns that can influence fog dispersal and maritime conditions. Overall, these indicators suggest typical San Francisco weather with no extreme weather events, but the consistently high humidity and variable winds may affect local climate conditions such as fog density and visibility.
