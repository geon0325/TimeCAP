Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown recovery from a low point, reaching above the 4,000 mark, which suggests a return of investor confidence, potentially due to positive economic data or easing of market headwinds. The VIX, or Volatility Index, has trended downwards, indicating a decrease in market volatility and investor fear, aligning with the recovery in the S&P 500. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 have both exhibited upward trends, reflecting positive investor sentiment in major international markets, which can contribute to a more stable global financial environment. Gold Futures have risen, suggesting that investors may still be hedging against potential market risks, despite the recovery in equity markets. Meanwhile, Crude Oil Futures have declined, which could signal concerns about future economic growth or a response to increased energy supplies, and currency exchange rates indicate a weakening of the USD against the JPY and CNY, as well as fluctuation in EUR/USD, pointing to potential shifts in international trade dynamics and currency markets.
