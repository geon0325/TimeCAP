Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature that peaked in the late afternoon before slightly dropping in the evening, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels have shown fluctuations, with notable peaks during the cooler early morning hours, which is common as cooler air holds less moisture leading to higher relative humidity. Air pressure has been generally decreasing, suggesting the possibility of a developing low-pressure system that could lead to unsettled weather conditions. Wind speeds have been mostly light to moderate, with some increase towards the end of the period, which could enhance the feeling of cooler temperatures at night and potentially contribute to the dispersal of any localized air pollutants. The wind direction has been variable, predominantly coming from the east to southeast, which is typical for Houston's location on the Gulf Coast and could bring moisture-laden air into the area, possibly increasing humidity and cloud cover.
