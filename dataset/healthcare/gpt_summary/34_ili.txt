Over the past 20 weeks, the data indicates a steady increase in the percentage of patients presenting with Influenza-like Illness (ILI), surpassing the baseline threshold near the end of the observed period. The age group of 0-4 years consistently showed the highest number of ILI cases, an indication that this demographic may be the most affected and potentially the most significant vector for transmission. Notably, after a period of growth, there appears to be a plateau in ILI case ratios, which may suggest the beginning of a stabilization phase or a peak in ILI activity. The oldest demographic (65 or more) also saw a gradual increase in ILI cases, raising concerns about the vulnerability of this age group to complications. The healthcare system may need to allocate resources to address the increased demand from younger and older populations, and public health initiatives could focus on these groups to mitigate further spread and impact.
