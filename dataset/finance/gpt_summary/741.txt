Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown some volatility but has remained relatively stable, with a slight downward trend from a high of 4791.19 to closing at 4696.05. The VIX, which tracks market volatility, has fluctuated, but has remained under 22, suggesting that while there have been some uncertainties, there hasn't been extreme fear in the markets. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have experienced their own volatility, with the Nikkei showing a sharp drop in the latest session, and the FTSE 100 presenting a gradual rise overall, despite some fluctuations. Gold Futures have seen an upward movement, indicating a possible increase in risk-averse sentiment among investors, while Crude Oil Futures have been on an upward trajectory, ending significantly higher, which could signal expectations of increasing demand or concerns over supply constraints. The currency markets have been relatively stable with minor fluctuations in EUR/USD and USD/JYP pairs, while the USD/CNY pair has remained steady, indicating a period of relative calm in currency valuations against the dollar.
