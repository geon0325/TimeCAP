Over the last 20 weeks, the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia to the total number of deaths has exhibited variability, with a peak at 9.15% in week 7 and a low of 6.51% in week 19, fluctuating around the average of 7.84%. Despite the total number of deaths showing a decreasing trend from a high of 70168 in week 7 to 55957 in week 20, deaths from Influenza or Pneumonia have not consistently followed this decline, indicating a potential focus area for healthcare interventions. The highest number of deaths from Influenza occurred in week 4 with 1028 deaths, while Pneumonia deaths peaked in week 7 with 5428 deaths, suggesting seasonal patterns or other epidemiological factors influencing these figures. The ratio of mortality from these conditions compared to total deaths has generally decreased over the 20-week period, aligning with a possible reduction in the spread or severity of these illnesses or improvements in treatment and prevention strategies. However, the consistently elevated ratios above the overall average in the first 10 weeks highlight the necessity for ongoing vigilance and resource allocation to manage and mitigate the impact of these respiratory conditions within the healthcare system.
