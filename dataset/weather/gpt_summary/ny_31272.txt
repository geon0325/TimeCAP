Over the last 24 hours in New York City, temperatures have shown a gradual increase, indicating a warming trend that could suggest milder conditions moving forward. Humidity levels began high but experienced fluctuations throughout the day, with a noticeable decrease midway through the period, which could have impacted the subjective feeling of temperature, making it feel more comfortable. Air pressure varied slightly but remained relatively stable, suggesting that no significant weather fronts were passing through the area during the observed time. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate and decreased towards the latter half of the day, which might have contributed to the increasing temperatures by reducing the wind chill factor. The wind direction was predominantly from the northeast, shifting to a southerly direction briefly, and then settling into a southeasterly pattern, which could be associated with the transportation of warmer air masses towards the region.
