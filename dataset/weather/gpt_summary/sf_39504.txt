Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon, before cooling down slightly towards the evening. Humidity levels have shown notable fluctuations, starting at moderate levels in the morning, spiking during the night, and then dropping significantly by the end of the observed period. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable but experienced a sharp increase in the midday hours, which could be indicative of a passing weather front. Wind speeds varied mildly throughout the day, with a couple of instances of higher gusts that may have contributed to the drop in humidity levels by dispersing moisture in the air. Wind direction has been variable, with no persistent pattern, suggesting a lack of a dominant weather system influencing the local climate during this time frame.
