Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia to the total number of deaths has shown fluctuations but generally depicts a decreasing trend from a high of 13.74% to a low of 6.10%, before a slight increase to 6.43% in the last recorded week. The total number of deaths peaked in the fourth week at 74,257, corresponding with the highest reported mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia. Notably, there was a significant spike in deaths attributed to influenza in the fifth week (887 deaths), which deviates markedly from the otherwise relatively stable influenza mortality figures. While the number of deaths from pneumonia consistently surpassed those from influenza, both causes saw an overall decrease over the 20-week period, with pneumonia deaths decreasing from 9,304 in the second week to 3,722 in the final week. These trends suggest some success in managing these respiratory conditions, but the healthcare system must remain vigilant, especially considering the temporal spikes that could signify periodic outbreaks or seasonal effects.
