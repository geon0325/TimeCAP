Over the past 20 weeks, there has been an observable increase in the proportion of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases among all patient visits, with the percentage exceeding the 2.9% benchmark in week 7 and reaching a peak of 6.31% by week 14. Particularly notable is the sustained increase in ILI percentages for the last 14 weeks, indicating a persistent and elevated influenza activity. The highest burden of ILI cases is seen in the youngest (0-4 years) and school-age (5-24 years) populations, with a significant peak in these age groups, suggesting increased transmission among children and young adults. While the ILI percentages have decreased from the peak, they remain above the benchmark, with the latest data indicating a 4.28% ILI patient ratio, which may continue to strain healthcare resources. This trend calls for continued public health surveillance and possibly increased healthcare readiness to manage a higher volume of ILI cases, particularly among younger age groups.
