Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a significant increase in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, rising from an initial 1.09% to a peak of 18.27% in week 13, before a slight decrease to 15.58% in the most recent data. The number of positive specimens for Influenza A showed an upward trend, peaking at 22,817 in week 13, but then saw a reduction to 11,018 by week 20, suggesting a possible decline in Influenza A activity. In contrast, Influenza B has been consistently increasing, with positive cases rising from 273 to 7,644, and its proportion among positive specimens growing from 0.42% to 6.38% over the 20-week period. This trend indicates a shifting pattern in influenza virus prevalence, with Influenza B becoming more prominent as the season progresses. The overall high ratio of positives in recent weeks could strain healthcare resources, necessitating increased vigilance and possibly adjustments in public health strategies to manage both prevention and treatment efforts for influenza.
