Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable upward trend in temperature, peaking during the late afternoon hours, indicative of typical diurnal variation. The relative humidity reached saturation during the early morning, which could have resulted in fog or dew, but gradually decreased as temperatures rose, suggesting the likelihood of more comfortable conditions later in the day. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable with a slight decrease toward the end of the period, which might suggest a minor change in weather patterns, but nothing indicative of significant weather events. Wind speeds were generally light and variable, with a tendency to remain at gentle breeze levels, not posing any immediate concern for wind-related impacts. Wind direction varied throughout the day, predominantly coming from the south to southeast, which is common for Houston and can contribute to increased moisture and warmth in the area.
