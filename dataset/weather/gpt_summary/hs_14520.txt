Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have shown a steady upward trend during the daytime, reaching their peak in the late afternoon before gradually declining as the evening approached. Humidity levels started relatively high in the early hours and saw a significant drop during midday, likely contributing to more comfortable conditions despite the higher temperatures but increased again towards the night, suggesting a muggy evening and night. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with no significant fluctuations that would indicate the immediate likelihood of a weather system developing. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate and varied throughout the day, with calm conditions in the early morning hours giving way to some gustier winds in the late afternoon and evening. The wind direction shifted significantly, starting from the south, becoming variable when winds were calm, and then primarily coming from the north and east in the later hours, which could influence the movement of weather patterns in the area.
