Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, peaking in the most recent measurements. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with particularly high readings during the cooler early morning hours, suggesting the presence of moisture in the air that could contribute to a feeling of mugginess. Air pressure showed variability with a noticeable drop towards the end of the period, which could be indicative of an approaching weather system or front. Wind speeds remained generally low to moderate throughout the day, with occasional calm periods, while the wind direction shifted markedly, suggesting a change in the weather pattern. The combination of high humidity, increasing temperatures, and the drop in air pressure could lead to the development of unsettled weather, possibly including thunderstorms or heavy rain.
