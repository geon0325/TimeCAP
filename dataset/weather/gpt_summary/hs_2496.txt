Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable downward trend in temperature, transitioning from warmer conditions to notably cooler temperatures by the end of the observed period. This cooling trend was accompanied by a slight increase in humidity, peaking at a point then stabilizing at a lower value towards the end of the period, indicating a possible influx of moisture into the area initially, followed by a drier atmosphere. Air pressure showed an overall gradual increase, suggesting a steady build-up of a high-pressure system in the region, which typically is associated with more stable weather conditions. Wind speed experienced fluctuations with a general increase towards the latter part of the period, which could contribute to cooler and drier conditions following the initial rise in humidity. Wind direction shifted significantly from predominantly southerly to northerly, indicating a frontal passage that could be responsible for the observed changes in temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
