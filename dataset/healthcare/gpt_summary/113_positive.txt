Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a significant increase in the number of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, reaching a peak ratio of positive specimens at 27.37% in week 8 before starting to decline. While both Influenza A and B showed an upward trend initially, with Influenza A peaking at a 21.62% positivity rate in week 4 and Influenza B at 10.95% in week 10, their prevalence has decreased in the most recent weeks to 2.77% and 6.63%, respectively. The overall ratio of positive specimens has also seen a reduction, currently standing at 9.40%. This trend suggests that the influenza season may have reached its peak and is now on a downward trajectory. Healthcare systems should remain vigilant, as influenza B remains a significant contributor to the total positive cases and seasonal variability could still impact the rates of infection.
