Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a steady increase in the number of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases across all age groups. The most significant rise in ILI cases has been observed in the age groups 0-4 and 25-49, suggesting these demographics might be particularly susceptible or exposed to the circulating strains. While the ratio of ILI patients remained below the baseline of 2.9% throughout the 20-week period, there is a noticeable uptrend in recent weeks, approaching the threshold that might signal an impending influenza outbreak. The healthcare system should prepare for a potential increase in demand for medical services, particularly in pediatrics and primary care. This trend, if it continues, may necessitate a public health response, including increased surveillance, vaccination campaigns, and public awareness initiatives to mitigate the spread of influenza.
