Over the last 20 weeks, there has been an observable trend of increasing influenza activity, reaching a peak ratio of positive specimens of 9.89% in week 14 before declining to 6.00% in week 20. Influenza A has been the predominant strain, with its highest detection rate of 9.85% in week 14, which then decreased to 5.97% by week 20, while Influenza B remained a minor contributor, peaking at 0.17% in week 13. The peak of influenza activity corresponds with a higher number of positive specimens, indicating a surge that could potentially strain healthcare resources. Despite the recent decline, the end ratio of 6.00% still lies below the average ratio of 6.26%, suggesting that influenza prevalence is slightly decreasing but remains a concern. Healthcare providers should remain vigilant and continue promoting vaccination and preventive measures, considering the approaching end of the typical flu season and the potential for unpredictable fluctuations in infection rates.
