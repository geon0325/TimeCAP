Over the last 20 weeks, the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data show a general declining trend in the percentage of ILI cases among all patient visits, starting above the benchmark of 2.9% and decreasing to a low of 1.52% before slightly increasing again to 2.59%. The most significant rise in ILI cases in recent weeks has been observed in the youngest age group (0-4 years), which has seen a consistent increase in ILI patient counts, indicating a potential concern for increased transmission in this demographic. The age groups of 5-24 and 25-49 years have also experienced a recent uptick in ILI cases, which could suggest a broader resurgence of influenza activity. Notably, despite a recent increase in ILI percentages, the proportion of ILI cases has remained below the 2.9% severity benchmark throughout the 20-week period. The observed trends may suggest a need for targeted public health interventions, particularly for young children, and continued monitoring to respond effectively to changing influenza dynamics.
