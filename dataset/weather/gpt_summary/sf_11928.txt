Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced relatively stable temperatures with a slight warming trend observed during the latter part of the period. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with instances of complete saturation suggesting the possibility of fog or mist, particularly during the early hours when the temperature was lower. Air pressure remained mostly constant, indicating stable weather conditions without the presence of significant weather fronts moving through the area. Wind speeds varied, with a noticeable increase towards the end of the period, which could result in cooler perceived temperatures and potentially clearer skies as the higher winds disperse humidity. The predominant wind direction was westerly, although there were brief periods of calm winds and a shift to northerly and easterly directions, which is not uncommon for the region's microclimates.
