Over the last 20 weeks, the proportion of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases among the total patient count has consistently remained below the benchmark severity level of 2.9%, with a decreasing trend reaching a low of 1.19% in Week 16 and a slight increase to 1.36% by Week 20. The highest proportion of ILI cases occurred in the youngest age group (0-4 years), which peaked in Week 1 and then showed a decreasing trend. The age group of 5-24 years followed a similar pattern, with a peak in Week 1 and a subsequent decline, indicating a possible seasonal pattern or the success of preventive measures. All age groups experienced a decline in ILI incidence over the period, suggesting a reduction in influenza transmission or effective public health interventions. Despite the current ILI rates being below the benchmark severity level, the healthcare system should continue monitoring these trends and remain prepared for potential increases or unexpected changes in the ILI incidence.
