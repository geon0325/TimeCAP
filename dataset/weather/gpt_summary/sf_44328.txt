Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a noticeable upward trend in temperature, reaching its peak in the latest hours, indicative of a warming trend. Humidity levels have fluctuated significantly, with the highest values recorded during the cooler early hours and dropping as temperatures rose, which is typical as warmer air can hold more moisture. Air pressure has shown a slight but steady decrease over the period, which could signal a change in weather patterns, possibly leading to less stable weather conditions. Wind speeds have been generally light but picked up towards the end of the period, suggesting an increase in wind activity that could influence cooler conditions if sustained. Wind direction has been variable, with shifts from northwesterly to northerly and even easterly directions, which can affect coastal and inland temperatures differently due to oceanic influences.
