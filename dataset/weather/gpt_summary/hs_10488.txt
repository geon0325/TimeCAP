Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a slight warming trend with temperatures gradually increasing. Humidity levels have also been on the rise, reaching their peak towards the end of the observed period, which might suggest an increased likelihood of precipitation or fog formation. Air pressure has been steadily decreasing, which is commonly associated with the approach of a low-pressure system and could lead to unstable weather conditions. Wind speeds have remained constant and very light, indicating a lack of significant weather fronts moving through the area during this time. The wind direction has not varied, maintaining a steady flow from the same direction, which is unusual and could contribute to localized weather patterns.
