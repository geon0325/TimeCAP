Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable increase in the ratio of specimens testing positive for influenza, with a marked surge in Influenza A cases driving this trend. The overall positivity rate grew from 0.25% in the first week to 6.87% in the twentieth week, exceeding the average ratio of 6.26%, which signals an upward trajectory in influenza transmission. Influenza A has been the predominant strain throughout the period, with its positivity rate increasing from 0.19% to 6.78%, while Influenza B has remained a relatively minor contributor, showing only a slight increase from 0.06% to 0.09%. The peak of Influenza A activity was observed between weeks 7 and 10, with the highest recorded ratio of 6.17% in week 8, although the latest week shows a continued rise. This trend suggests a growing burden on healthcare resources, warranting increased vigilance and potentially heightened measures for influenza prevention and control.
