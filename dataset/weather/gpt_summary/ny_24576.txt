Over the past 24 hours in New York City, the temperature has experienced a moderate diurnal fluctuation, peaking during the afternoon hours and reaching its lowest point towards the early morning, consistent with typical daily temperature cycles. Humidity levels saw a significant increase overnight, indicative of a more saturated atmosphere, but decreased during the day, likely providing some relief from mugginess. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with only slight variations, suggesting a period of steady weather conditions without the immediate influence of strong frontal systems. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate and showed some variation, but without any significant gusts or calm periods, indicating a relatively breezy day without disruptive wind events. The wind direction was predominantly from the northwest, shifting slightly throughout the day, which could have contributed to the transport of cooler, drier air into the region, affecting both temperature and humidity levels.
