Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature, with a general increase during the day followed by a slight decrease towards the evening, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels have shown an inverse relationship with temperature, peaking during the cooler early morning hours and dropping as temperatures rose, which is consistent with the expected daily humidity cycle. The air pressure experienced a gradual decline throughout the period, suggesting a potential change in weather patterns that could lead to increased cloud cover or precipitation if the trend continues. Wind speeds remained relatively light and variable, with no significant gusts that would impact conditions on the ground substantially. The wind direction was predominantly from the south-southwest, with some variability, which is typical for Houston and can contribute to the transport of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico into the area.
