Over the last 20 weeks, the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data indicate a peak in the ratio of ILI patients at 2.67% in week 12, surpassing the severity benchmark of 2.9%, which suggests a significant influenza activity during that period. Since then, there has been a notable downward trend, with the current proportion of ILI cases at 1.65%, below the threshold. The highest number of ILI cases was observed in the 5-24 age group, reaching a peak in week 10, and has significantly decreased since, aligning with the overall decrease in ILI percentages. The consistent decline in ILI cases across all age groups over the recent weeks suggests a waning phase of the influenza season. However, healthcare systems should remain vigilant, as ILI ratios above the threshold in earlier weeks indicate the potential for future outbreaks and the need for sustained preventive measures.
