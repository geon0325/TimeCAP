Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, with a minimum of 7.28% and reaching a peak of 15.78%. The significant upward trend in the ratio began in week 11, coinciding with an absolute increase in both influenza and pneumonia deaths, suggesting a potential seasonal outbreak or a more virulent strain of these illnesses. The highest absolute numbers of deaths from pneumonia occurred between weeks 13 and 16, where the mortality ratio also sharply exceeded the 20-week average of 7.84%. However, the most recent data shows a decline in both the number of deaths from influenza and pneumonia and their combined mortality ratio, indicating a possible easing of the outbreak. This trend warrants continued monitoring as it has implications for healthcare resource allocation and public health interventions.
