Over the last 20 weeks, the data reveals a gradual decrease in the percentage of ILI patients relative to the total number of patients seen, suggesting a downtrend in ILI incidence. The highest proportions of ILI were observed at the beginning of the time series, with a consistent decline across all age groups, indicating a widespread reduction in ILI activity. The age groups 0-4 and 5-24 showed the most significant number of ILI cases, reflecting a higher vulnerability or transmission rate within these younger populations. Despite the overall decline, the ILI percentages remained above the baseline for several weeks before eventually falling below, suggesting that the healthcare system may have experienced periods of increased demand earlier in the series. The current data showing ILI percentages below the baseline is a positive indicator for the healthcare system, possibly reflecting the effectiveness of preventive measures or the end of a seasonal ILI peak.
