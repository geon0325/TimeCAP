Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a fluctuating pattern of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) across different age groups, peaking in the weeks where the ratio of ILI patients exceeded the baseline threshold. Notably, the highest incidence of ILI was observed among the age groups 5-24 and 25-49, suggesting that these populations were particularly affected during periods when the ILI ratio rose above baseline. There has been a subsequent decline in ILI cases across all age groups, with the most recent weeks showing ILI ratios well below the baseline, indicating a potential easing of the ILI situation. However, the consistent presence of ILI cases, especially in the younger and middle-aged cohorts, underscores the need for ongoing surveillance and preparedness in the healthcare system. The downward trend in the ratio of ILI patients towards the latter part of the 20-week period could suggest a waning of the ILI season, but vigilance is required to monitor for any potential resurgence.
