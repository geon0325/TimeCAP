Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have shown a slight cooling trend overnight, reaching their lowest point just before dawn, before gradually increasing towards the afternoon. Humidity levels fluctuated moderately but generally remained within a range that suggests a relatively stable atmosphere, with a slight decrease observed in the later hours, which could contribute to a feeling of dryness. Atmospheric pressure has been quite steady, indicating a period of stable weather with no significant weather fronts passing through the area. Wind speeds varied, with some gustier conditions earlier in the period that have since calmed significantly, potentially leading to more settled weather conditions. The wind direction was predominantly from the west and northwest, although there was a notable shift to a southerly direction for a brief period, followed by calm to no wind at the end of the observation period, which could affect local temperature distribution and air quality.
