Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a general declining trend in the percentage of deaths attributed to Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, starting at 8.41% and diminishing to 5.64%. This trend suggests an overall decrease in the impact of these respiratory diseases on mortality rates. However, the average mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia over the 20-week period is 6.73%, which is lower than the historical average of 7.84%, indicating a better-than-average period in managing fatalities from these illnesses. Notably, the number of deaths from Influenza has shown a significant decrease from 388 deaths in the first week to 41 deaths in the last week, which may reflect effective public health interventions or seasonal variations. Despite the decrease in Influenza or Pneumonia-related mortality, vigilance in public health strategies is essential, as these diseases continue to represent a substantial proportion of weekly deaths.
