Over the past 20 weeks, the ratio of mortality attributed to influenza or pneumonia has exhibited a fluctuating pattern, with an initial upward trend reaching a peak of 13.74% in week 9, followed by a subsequent decline to 6.39% by week 20. Despite the overall decline in recent weeks, the mortality ratio from these causes remained above the average ratio of 7.84% for the majority of the observed period. A notable spike in deaths from influenza occurred in week 10, contributing to an anomalous peak of 887 deaths compared to an otherwise low average of 27 deaths in the other weeks. Pneumonia consistently accounted for a significant proportion of the mortality, with deaths ranging from 3,840 to 10,052, indicating a persistent burden on healthcare resources. The downward trend in the mortality ratio in the latter half of the period suggests a possible easing of the healthcare burden from these respiratory conditions, but the consistently higher than average ratios for most of the period signal a need for ongoing vigilance and resource allocation.
