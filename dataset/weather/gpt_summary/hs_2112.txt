Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a mild and relatively stable temperature profile with a subtle warming trend during the daytime hours followed by a slight cooling trend at night. Humidity levels remained high throughout most of the period, indicating a moist air mass over the region, but there was a noticeable decrease in humidity later in the day, which could have led to a feeling of decreased mugginess. Air pressure experienced minor fluctuations with a slight overall increase, suggesting a potential for stable weather conditions to persist. Wind speeds varied from calm to moderate and increased towards the end of the period, which could enhance the wind chill factor and disperse any pollutants, potentially leading to clearer skies. The wind direction was variable but predominantly from the east and northeast, shifting towards a northerly direction by the end of the period, which is characteristic of frontal passage or changing weather patterns in the region.
