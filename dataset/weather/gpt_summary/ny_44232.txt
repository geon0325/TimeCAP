Over the last 24 hours, New York City experienced a gradual decline in temperature, followed by a noticeable increase and a subsequent moderate decrease, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels fluctuated, with values increasing notably during the cooler early morning hours, which is common as cooler air holds less moisture, leading to higher relative humidity. Air pressure showed a slow decreasing trend, suggesting a slight change in atmospheric conditions that could signal a change in weather patterns. Wind speeds remained generally light with some variability, but without a consistent direction as indicated by several periods where the wind direction data was not recorded or was variable. The combination of these weather indicators points to stable weather conditions with no immediate signs of severe weather disruptions.
