Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature with a general cooling trend during the earlier hours followed by a warming trend more recently. Humidity levels started moderately high and increased to very high percentages, which could have contributed to a denser, foggier atmosphere, particularly in the early morning hours, but then started to decrease as temperatures rose. Air pressure remained relatively high throughout the period but showed a gradual decrease, suggesting a potential change in weather patterns such as the approach of a weather front. Wind speeds were very light and consistent, offering little relief from the humidity and indicating a stable weather pattern. The wind direction varied significantly, suggesting a lack of a dominant weather system influencing the area during this time frame.
