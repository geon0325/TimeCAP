Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have demonstrated a diurnal pattern with a peak during the afternoon and a gradual decline through the night and early morning. Humidity levels remained relatively high throughout the period, indicating a moist air mass in the region, which peaked during the early morning hours likely due to nighttime cooling. Air pressure has been slowly decreasing, suggesting a possible approach of a low-pressure system that could lead to changing weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate but increased towards the end of the period, which may enhance the feeling of lower temperatures and could signal the arrival of a frontal system. Predominant wind directions have been from the south to south-east, which typically brings warmer air from the Gulf of Mexico to Houston, contributing to the higher temperatures observed.
