Over the last 24 hours, the weather in Houston has experienced a significant fluctuation in temperature, with a noticeable warming trend that peaked during the latter part of the day. Humidity levels have varied widely, reaching saturation at times, which could be indicative of foggy conditions or the presence of precipitation during those periods. Air pressure showed a minor decreasing trend initially, followed by a significant increase, which suggests the movement of a high-pressure system into the area. Wind speeds have been generally light to moderate but increased towards the end of the period, which may influence the dispersion of any local air pollutants and could also affect small watercraft operations. The wind direction has been predominantly from the south to south-east, which is typical for this region and could contribute to the transportation of moist air from the Gulf of Mexico, affecting local humidity levels.
