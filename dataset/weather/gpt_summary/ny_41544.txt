Over the last 24 hours in New York City, there has been a notable warming trend with a slight increase in temperature after a cooler start to the period. Humidity levels fluctuated, starting at relatively low levels before increasing significantly, suggesting an increase in moisture in the air which could potentially lead to cloud formation or precipitation if conditions are right. Atmospheric pressure showed a gradual decrease over the period, which is often associated with the approach of a low-pressure system that could lead to unsettled weather conditions. Wind speeds varied, with a period of higher gusts that might have contributed to a wind chill effect, making it feel cooler than the actual temperature. The wind direction was predominantly from the south to southwest, except for a few instances where it shifted, which could influence the transportation of air masses and potentially affect local weather patterns, such as bringing in warmer or cooler air from different regions.
