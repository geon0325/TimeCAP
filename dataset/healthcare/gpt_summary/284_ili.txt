Over the last 20 weeks, the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data indicates a fluctuating yet generally increasing trend in the ratio of ILI patients across all age groups, with the overall ILI patient ratio remaining below the baseline of 2.9%. The age group 25-49 consistently reported the highest number of ILI patients, suggesting this demographic may be particularly affected or more likely to seek medical attention for ILI symptoms. The youngest age group, 0-4 years, showed a steady increase in ILI cases, which warrants attention due to the potential for rapid spread in settings such as daycare and preschool. While the overall ILI ratio is below the baseline, the incremental rises in the ratio and the number of patients in recent weeks could signal an emerging trend that requires close monitoring. The healthcare system should be prepared for a potential increase in demand for medical services, especially in outpatient settings, and consider reinforcing public health messaging on preventive measures for at-risk age groups.
