Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a slight decrease in temperature followed by a gradual increase towards the latter part of the day, suggesting a typical diurnal pattern with warmer conditions in the afternoon. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with notably higher humidity during the night and early morning hours, which could have led to a muggy feel for residents. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight decrease towards the end of the period, which may indicate an approaching weather system or front. Wind speeds varied but were generally light to moderate, with a peak during the mid-afternoon, potentially providing some relief from the warmth. The wind direction shifted throughout the day, starting from easterly, becoming variable, and then predominantly southerly, which is common in this region and may have contributed to the fluctuations in humidity.
