Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has exhibited a typical diurnal pattern, initially decreasing to reach the lowest point in the early morning before gradually rising throughout the day. Relative humidity levels have shown inverse behavior relative to temperature, with the highest humidity occurring when temperatures were at their lowest, suggesting possible early morning fog or dew. Air pressure experienced a significant rise during the period, which is indicative of a stable atmospheric condition that could lead to clearer skies and calmer weather. Wind speed remained relatively low with some variability, but without any strong gusts that would significantly impact conditions on the ground. The wind direction was generally variable but predominantly from the south and southwest, which is typical for Houston and may bring in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, affecting local humidity levels.
