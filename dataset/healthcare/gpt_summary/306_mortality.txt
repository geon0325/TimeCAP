Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the mortality ratio of Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, with a peak of 13.74% in week 7, which is significantly higher than the average ratio of 7.84%. This peak coincided with an unusual spike in deaths attributed to influenza, reaching 887, which is markedly higher than any other week's count. Following this peak, the ratio has generally trended downwards, reaching a low of 6.19% in the final week, suggesting a decrease in the impact of Influenza or Pneumonia on overall mortality. The total number of deaths has shown a slight decrease over the 20 weeks, moving from 66813 to 60085, with a concurrent decrease in deaths from pneumonia from 7324 to 3674. This trend indicates a potential easing of the burden on healthcare systems from these respiratory conditions, but continued vigilance is necessary to manage seasonal variability and potential outbreaks.
