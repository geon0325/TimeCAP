Over the past 24 hours, the temperature in Houston has demonstrated a typical diurnal pattern with a peak during the afternoon hours and a gradual decrease overnight. Relative humidity showed an inverse relationship with temperature, with the highest humidity values occurring in the early morning when temperatures were at their lowest, suggesting the potential for morning fog or dew. Atmospheric pressure experienced a slight decreasing trend over the period, indicating a possible approach of a weather system that could lead to changing weather conditions. Wind speeds remained generally light, with a significant increase during the late afternoon, which could have contributed to some relief from the heat. The wind direction varied significantly, with a notable shift from southeasterly to northerly winds, and then to easterly, which might be associated with the passage of a frontal boundary or local sea breeze effects.
