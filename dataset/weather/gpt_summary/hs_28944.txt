Over the last 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before a significant drop in the evening. Humidity levels were notably high throughout the day, often reaching saturation, which could have contributed to foggy conditions or a heightened chance of precipitation. Air pressure showed a slight decrease through the day, followed by a substantial increase in the final hours, which may indicate the approach of a high-pressure system potentially leading to clearer skies. Wind speeds were calm at the start of the period but progressively increased, becoming quite gusty by the end of the 24-hour window. The wind direction shifted from easterly in the early hours to predominantly southerly and then westerly, signaling a possible change in weather patterns, such as the passage of a frontal system.
