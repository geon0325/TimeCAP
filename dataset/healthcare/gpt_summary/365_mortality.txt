Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a general decreasing trend in the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, with the ratio starting at 9.07% and ending at 5.90%, which is below the 20-week average of 7.84%. The total number of deaths peaked in the second week at 67,831 before gradually declining to a low of 24,395 in week 17, subsequently rising again to 58,446 by week 20. The number of deaths attributed specifically to Influenza has seen a significant decline, dropping from 892 in the first week to just 53 in the last week. Pneumonia deaths also decreased from 5,225 in week 2 to 1,337 in week 17, but unlike Influenza deaths, they rebounded to 3,393 by week 20. These fluctuations in mortality ratios and absolute numbers suggest a seasonal pattern and a potential temporary alleviation in the burden on healthcare resources, although the recent uptick warrants continued surveillance and preparedness for potential increases in cases.
