Over the last 20 weeks, mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia as a percentage of total deaths has shown slight fluctuations but has generally remained below the average ratio of 7.84%. The highest recorded weekly mortality rate from these causes was 6.11%, observed in weeks 1, 4, and 8, while the lowest was 5.36% in week 15. The total number of deaths fluctuated with a slight increase towards the end of the 20-week period, reaching a peak at 51694 deaths in week 17. Notably, the number of deaths from influenza remained relatively low, with a maximum of 24 deaths in week 1, suggesting that influenza is not currently a major contributor to overall mortality compared to pneumonia. Pneumonia continues to be a significant concern, with deaths ranging from 2695 to 3127 across the 20 weeks, indicating a persistent burden on the healthcare system that requires ongoing attention and resources.
