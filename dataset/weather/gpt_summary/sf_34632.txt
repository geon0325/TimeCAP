Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual decline in temperature from the late afternoon into the night, followed by a significant warming trend during the daytime. Humidity levels showed a slight fluctuation but notably peaked during the early morning hours, which could have led to foggy conditions, particularly when the temperature was at its lowest. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase midday, indicating steady weather patterns without significant disturbances. Wind speeds were generally light but increased towards the end of the period, suggesting a breeze picking up which could disperse any early fog or low clouds. The wind direction varied widely throughout the day, starting from a northeasterly direction, shifting to southerly and westerly, and finally becoming more northwesterly, which is typical for the region's varied microclimates.
