Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced a steady climb in temperature which peaked in the late afternoon before stabilizing slightly below the day's maximum by the end of the period. Humidity levels were consistently high at the beginning of the day, indicating a very moist atmosphere, but they gradually decreased as the temperature rose, suggesting an inverse relationship between temperature and humidity throughout the day. Air pressure showed a slight but steady decline, which could be associated with the development of unstable weather conditions or the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate but increased during the day, reaching their peak in the late afternoon, which, combined with the declining air pressure, could signal the potential for wind-related weather events. The wind direction varied significantly, with a notable shift from northerly to southerly winds, which could have contributed to the increase in temperature as warmer air from the south moved into the area.
