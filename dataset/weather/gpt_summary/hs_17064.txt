Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have seen a mild fluctuation with a general decrease during the observed period, suggesting a cooling trend. Humidity levels remained high throughout, indicative of a moist and potentially muggy atmosphere which is typical for the region. Air pressure experienced a slight but consistent increase, pointing towards stable atmospheric conditions and possibly clearer weather ahead. Wind speeds were mostly gentle to moderate and showed some increase mid-period, which might have contributed to a slight cooling effect. The wind direction was predominantly from the east to northeast, which is common for Houston's weather patterns and could be associated with moisture coming in from the Gulf of Mexico.
