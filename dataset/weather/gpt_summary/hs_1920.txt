Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, transitioning from warm conditions to significantly cooler temperatures. Humidity levels were very high in the early hours but showed a marked decrease through the day, reaching exceedingly low levels by the evening, which could have implications for comfort and perceived temperature. Air pressure has been steadily increasing, indicating a likely shift toward stable and clearer weather conditions. Wind speeds have been moderate to fresh, with a notable increase towards the current hour, suggesting an influx of air masses that could be responsible for the changes in temperature and humidity. The wind direction shifted from southerly to northwesterly, a pattern that is often associated with the passage of a cold front, possibly explaining the observed drop in temperature and humidity.
