Over the last 20 weeks, there has been an observable increase in the ratio of positive respiratory specimens for influenza, with a notable rise from week 1 (2.89%) to week 20 (9.89%). The prevalence of Influenza A has been significantly higher than Influenza B, as evidenced by the ratio of positive specimens peaking at 9.85% for Influenza A and only 0.17% for Influenza B in week 18. The overall average positivity rate of 6.26% indicates a consistent presence of influenza in the tested population. The upward trend in the positivity rate, particularly for Influenza A, suggests an increasing burden on the healthcare system, which may require heightened preparedness for managing influenza cases. Despite fluctuations in the number of specimens tested, the increasing proportion of positive tests highlights the importance of continued surveillance and potentially increased vaccination efforts to mitigate the impact of influenza.
