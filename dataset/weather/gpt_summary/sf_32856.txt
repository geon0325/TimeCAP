Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperature exhibited a diurnal pattern with a peak during the daytime and a drop during the night, consistent with typical daily temperature fluctuations. Humidity levels varied, with higher values during the cooler early morning and late evening hours, which could have contributed to periods of morning and evening mist or fog, a common occurrence in the region. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight increase towards the middle of the period, suggesting steady weather conditions without the immediate approach of any significant weather systems. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with a noticeable decrease during the middle of the day, which could have led to calm conditions especially around coastal areas. The wind direction shifted predominantly between northerly and westerly vectors, with an unusual shift to a more southerly direction mid-period, which might have briefly influenced local temperature and humidity patterns.
