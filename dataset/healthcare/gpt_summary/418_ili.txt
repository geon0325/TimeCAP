Over the past 20 weeks, the data reveals that the proportion of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases relative to total patient count has been fluctuating, with a peak at the beginning of the period (3.06%) and a general declining trend thereafter. The percentage of ILI cases has consistently remained under the 2.9% benchmark after week one, suggesting a decrease in influenza activity. The age group 0-4 consistently saw the highest number of ILI cases throughout the period, indicating that this demographic remains the most affected by influenza-like symptoms. The oldest age group (65 or more) had the least variation in patient numbers, suggesting a stable incidence in this demographic. The current data suggest a moderate healthcare burden due to ILI, with recent weeks showing a decline in cases that could indicate a lessening impact on the healthcare system.
