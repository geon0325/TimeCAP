Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a significant fluctuation in the rate of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a peak positivity rate of 30.26% in week 9, followed by a steady decline to a low of 0.22% by week 20. The number of specimens tested has decreased notably from 72,224 in week 8 to 12,822 in week 20, which could potentially impact the perceived decline in positivity rates. Influenza A demonstrated a higher peak positivity rate (19.31% in week 10) compared to Influenza B (17.59% in week 3), but both subtypes have shown a significant decrease in positivity rates towards the end of the 20-week period. The substantial decrease in the number of positive cases for both Influenza A and B, along with the reduction in the overall positivity ratio, suggests a downtrend in influenza activity. This trend, if sustained, could signal a reduction in influenza-related healthcare demand, but continuous monitoring is essential to detect any potential resurgence, especially considering the variability observed in the reported data.
