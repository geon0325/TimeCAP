Over the last 20 weeks, the data reveals a fluctuating trend in the mortality rate from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, with the ratio starting at 7.85%, peaking at 15.78% in the 5th week, and ending at 10.57%. This peak coincides with a surge in total deaths, suggesting a possible outbreak or increased seasonal prevalence of these respiratory conditions. The number of deaths specifically from Influenza has significantly decreased from 625 to 11, indicating a possible effective control of Influenza or a seasonal decline. However, deaths from Pneumonia have shown a more gradual decrease and a recent uptick from 4559 to 6765 in the last five weeks, warranting close monitoring and potentially increased healthcare resources to manage Pneumonia cases. The overall trend suggests that while Influenza may be less of a concern currently, Pneumonia remains a significant contributor to mortality and may require continued public health attention and resource allocation.
