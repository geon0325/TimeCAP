Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before cooling slightly in the evening. Humidity levels showed some fluctuations but remained relatively high, suggesting a moist air mass over the region. Air pressure was mostly stable until a significant drop occurred, which could be indicative of a developing weather system that might affect the area's conditions. Wind speeds varied but mostly stayed in the light to moderate range, with the wind direction shifting predominantly from westerly to northerly later in the period. This change in wind direction, coupled with the drop in air pressure, could signal the approach of a frontal system, possibly leading to changing weather patterns including increased cloudiness or precipitation.
