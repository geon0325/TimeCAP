Over the last 20 weeks, the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza has fluctuated, with an overall average positivity rate of 6.26%, which is above the highest recorded weekly percentage in the given data (0.40%). While the number of specimens tested has increased significantly towards the latter part of the 20-week period, peaking at 12,200 in the last week, the ratio of positive specimens also shows an upward trend in recent weeks, suggesting a possible surge in influenza cases. The data indicates that both Influenza A and B are present in the tested population, with Influenza B showing a slightly higher occurrence in positive specimens over the course of the period, notably peaking at 0.22% in week 18. The highest positivity rates for both Influenza A and B in the last week of data were 0.16% and 0.17%, respectively, demonstrating concurrent circulation of both types. This trend is important for healthcare providers to monitor and respond to, as an increase in flu cases could impact healthcare resources and necessitate increased vaccination efforts and public health interventions.
