Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperature has shown a slight fluctuation, with a general trend of cooling followed by a modest warming period later in the day. Humidity levels remained high throughout the day, indicating a significant amount of moisture in the air, which could potentially lead to fog or low clouds, particularly given the relatively stable high humidity values. Air pressure experienced a gradual increase, suggesting a period of stable weather conditions, although the slight pressure drop at the end of the period may indicate a forthcoming change. Wind speeds maintained light and calm conditions, which would not contribute to significant wind chill effects or dispersion of fog and pollutants. The wind direction varied but predominantly came from the west-northwest, which is typical for coastal San Francisco and indicative of the marine influence on the local climate.
