Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, indicating a warming trend. Despite this rise, humidity levels have decreased, suggesting drier air is moving into the area. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with a slight increase at one point, which could indicate stable weather conditions persisting. Wind speeds were mostly consistent with a slight uptick, and the wind direction was predominantly from the south, which is typical for this region and may contribute to the warming temperatures observed. Overall, the steady southward wind direction in combination with the rising temperatures and decreasing humidity levels points to a stable yet warmer and drier weather pattern for Houston in the near term.
