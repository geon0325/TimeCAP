Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a declining trend in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with an initial peak ratio of 9.50% in week 5 gradually dropping to a low of 0.62% by week 20. Influenza A has been the predominant strain throughout the period, accounting for the majority of positive cases, though its incidence has also followed a decreasing trend, from 9.45% in week 5 to 0.56% in week 20. In contrast, Influenza B has maintained a relatively low and stable presence, never exceeding 0.17% of the specimens tested. The observed reduction in influenza positivity rates suggests a current downward trend in flu activity, which may lead to a decreased burden on the healthcare system in the short term. However, ongoing surveillance is essential to monitor for potential reversals in this trend, as such changes could necessitate rapid public health responses to manage increased healthcare demand.
