Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable upward trend in the ratio of mortality due to Influenza or Pneumonia compared to total deaths, increasing from 5.00% to 8.37%, which exceeds the average ratio of 7.84%. The total number of deaths has also risen, with the final week reaching 65,760, the highest in the 20-week period. Notably, deaths from Influenza saw a significant surge in the last three weeks, escalating from 228 to 851. Deaths attributable to Pneumonia have also increased steadily, culminating at 4,654 in the last week recorded. This trend suggests a growing impact on healthcare resources and could indicate the need for increased public health interventions and healthcare preparedness to manage the rising cases of Influenza and Pneumonia.
