Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a significant upward trend in the number of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the ratio of positive specimens peaking at 23.65% in week 14 before declining to 12.35% by week 20. Influenza A has been the predominant strain, reaching a maximum positivity rate of 18.16% in week 14, but it has since decreased to 5.65% in the latest week. In contrast, Influenza B showed a slower increase and a less pronounced peak, with its positivity rate rising from 0.64% to 6.69%, suggesting it may be becoming a more common strain in the latter weeks. The overall average positivity rate of 6.26% masks the volatility seen during the 20-week period, emphasizing the need for continued monitoring and resource allocation. Given these trends, healthcare systems should be prepared for potential fluctuations in demand for influenza-related healthcare services and consider strategies for managing both Influenza A and B outbreaks.
