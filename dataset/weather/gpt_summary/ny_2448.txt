Over the past 24 hours in New York City, temperatures have exhibited a slight upward trend, suggesting a gradual warming pattern. Humidity levels have increased significantly, indicating a buildup of moisture in the air that could potentially lead to cloud formation or fog, particularly given the high humidity levels recorded towards the end of the period. Air pressure has been on a steady decline, which is often associated with the approach of a low-pressure system that could result in unsettled weather conditions. Wind speeds have been relatively constant, with a slight increase observed, which may contribute to wind chill factor making the air feel cooler than the actual temperature. The wind direction has been variable but primarily from the north and northeast, which is typical for cooler and possibly drier air masses moving into the area.
