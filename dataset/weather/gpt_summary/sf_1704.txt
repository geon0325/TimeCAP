Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a noticeable decline in temperature followed by a modest recovery, indicative of a typical diurnal temperature variation with cooler conditions prevailing during the night and warming up during daylight hours. Humidity levels have fluctuated significantly, reaching their peak towards the end of the period, which could suggest an increased likelihood of fog or mist, particularly during the early morning or late evening. Air pressure has been gradually decreasing, which is often associated with the approach of a weather system that could bring changes such as increased cloud cover or precipitation. Wind speeds have been generally light with some periods of calm, but there have been occasional gusts; the variability in wind direction suggests the absence of a dominant weather front. Overall, these conditions point to stable weather, but the decrease in pressure may indicate that a change could be on the horizon for San Francisco.
