Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality rate from Influenza or Pneumonia relative to total deaths has been fluctuating, reaching a peak of 13.74% in week 8 before a noticeable decline. Notably, there was an unusual spike in deaths from influenza specifically in week 9, with 887 deaths compared to its surrounding weeks, which may indicate an outbreak or a reporting anomaly. The overall trend shows that the mortality rate from these illnesses is currently on a downward trend, settling closer to the 20-week average of 7.84% in the most recent data. Pneumonia consistently accounts for the majority of the deaths in comparison to influenza. This pattern suggests that while there may have been situational increases potentially straining healthcare resources, the system appears to be returning to a more typical mortality distribution from these respiratory conditions.
