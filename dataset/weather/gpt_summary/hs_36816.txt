Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have demonstrated a mild fluctuation, with a general cooling trend leading into the early morning hours before stabilizing and slightly warming towards the latter part of the day. Humidity levels have varied, with notable peaks coinciding with the cooler temperatures, which is indicative of a moist air mass in the region, potentially leading to a sense of mugginess. Air pressure has shown a gradual increase throughout the period, suggesting a stable or strengthening weather pattern with high pressure likely influencing local conditions. Wind speeds have been mostly light to gentle, with some variability, but without any significant gusts that could indicate stormy conditions. The wind direction has been predominantly from the north and northeast, which is typical for cooler and drier air inflows in this region, though the consistent humidity suggests that this was not the case during the observed time frame.
