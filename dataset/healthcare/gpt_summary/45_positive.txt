Over the past 20 weeks, there has been an increasing trend in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a notable surge from an average positivity rate of 6.26% to a high of 14.00% in the most recent week. Influenza A has been the predominant strain, with its positivity rate increasing significantly from 0.45% to 12.83%, suggesting a possible outbreak or seasonal epidemic. The number of specimens tested has also risen steadily, peaking at 33,273 in the latest week, which could reflect a growing concern for respiratory illnesses or an enhanced surveillance response. Although Influenza B has shown a less dramatic increase in positivity rate, from 0.35% to 1.17%, it remains a consistent presence alongside Influenza A. The healthcare system may face increased strain due to the rising trend in flu cases, necessitating preparedness in terms of flu vaccine stockpiling, antiviral treatments, and healthcare resources for potential patient surges.
