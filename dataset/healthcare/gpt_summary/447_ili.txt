Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant upward trend in the proportion of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases among the total number of patients, with the ratio of ILI patients increasing from 1.26% to 5.21%. This rise has consistently exceeded the 2.9% benchmark for ILI severity since week 14, indicating an escalating influenza situation. The most pronounced increase in ILI cases has occurred in the 5-24 age group, which saw the number of ILI cases nearly septuple from 6966 to 48218 cases, suggesting this demographic is currently the most affected. In comparison, while there have also been increases in ILI cases among other age groups, the growth has been relatively less sharp. This trend indicates a potential strain on healthcare resources, especially those catering to the 5-24 age demographic, and suggests a need for heightened public health interventions targeting this group to manage the spread of influenza.
