Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable increase in the proportion of deaths attributed to influenza or pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, surpassing the average ratio of 7.84%. Starting with a ratio of 6.33% in the first week, it peaked at 15.78% in the 17th week before gradually declining to 13.00% by the 20th week. The absolute number of deaths from these conditions also rose sharply, with pneumonia deaths increasing from 3,490 to a peak of 11,988 in the 17th week, while deaths from influenza peaked at 655 in the 11th week and then significantly dropped to 66 by the final week. This trend suggests a severe period for respiratory illnesses, potentially straining healthcare resources and highlighting the importance of preventive measures and treatment readiness. The subsequent downward trend in the last three weeks may indicate a possible easing of the situation but still warrants close monitoring due to the higher than average mortality ratio.
