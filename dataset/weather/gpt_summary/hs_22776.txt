Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced relatively stable weather conditions, with temperatures slightly fluctuating around the average for this period, suggesting a typically warm day transitioning into a slightly cooler night. Humidity levels have shown a gradual increase through the night, peaking towards the morning hours, which is common and likely contributed to a feeling of mugginess, especially during the early hours. The air pressure remained remarkably steady, indicating no significant weather fronts moving through the area, thus suggesting a period of stable weather. Wind speeds were moderate and consistent, with a slight increase towards the latter part of the period, which might have provided some relief from the humidity. The wind direction was predominantly from the south-southeast throughout the day, which is typical for Houston and can bring in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, affecting local humidity levels.
