Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, transitioning from relatively high values to noticeably cooler conditions. Humidity levels have varied significantly throughout the period, with a notable increase during the cooler temperature phase, indicating a likelihood of a more muggy feeling in the air. Air pressure has shown minor fluctuations but has generally remained stable, with a slight increase when the temperature began to drop, suggesting that a high-pressure system could be influencing the weather. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate and decreased to calm conditions occasionally, which may have contributed to a buildup of humidity due to less air circulation. The wind direction has been predominantly southerly, but there was a notable shift to westerly and northerly winds at times, which could be associated with the passage of a weather front or a change in the local weather systems.
