Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a slight decrease in temperature before gradually warming again, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels showed a marked increase overnight, which is common due to cooling temperatures and could have led to early morning fog or dew. Atmospheric pressure remained largely stable, suggesting steady weather patterns without significant fronts or storm systems impacting the area. Wind speeds varied, with some hours experiencing gentle breezes while others had calmer conditions; this variability in wind speed could influence the dispersion of fog and coastal clouds. Lastly, the wind direction shifted notably throughout the day, ranging from southerly to northerly and easterly directions, which can affect coastal temperatures and fog formation depending on whether winds are onshore or offshore.
