Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, peaking at 13.74% in the second week and declining to a low of 5.84% by the 20th week. Despite the overall declining trend in the mortality ratio, the total number of deaths from these illnesses remains significant, with pneumonia deaths notably higher than those from influenza. The highest number of deaths from influenza occurred in the third week with 887 deaths, which coincided with a spike in the mortality ratio, suggesting a possible outbreak or increased virulence. The consistent decrease in the mortality ratio over the latter weeks could indicate improved healthcare interventions, seasonal patterns, or a decreased prevalence of these respiratory diseases. However, the healthcare system should remain vigilant, as pneumonia continues to account for a substantial proportion of deaths, warranting continued surveillance and prevention efforts.
