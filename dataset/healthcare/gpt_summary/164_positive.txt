Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant fluctuation in the number of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a peak positivity rate of 26.24% in week 13 and a subsequent decline to 11.91% by week 20. The majority of positive cases were identified as Influenza A, which demonstrated a similar trend, peaking at 25.36% and decreasing to 10.12%. In contrast, the ratio of Influenza B cases has been considerably lower, though it increased slightly from 0.38% to 1.79% over the period. The highest overall positivity rate for both types of influenza occurred mid-season, suggesting a typical seasonal pattern with a potential strain on healthcare resources during this peak. The decline in positivity rates towards the end of the 20-week period could indicate a tapering off of the flu season, but the healthcare system should remain vigilant for potential resurgences and continue promoting vaccinations and other preventive measures.
