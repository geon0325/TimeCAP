Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates an upward trend in the number of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with an increase in both Influenza A and B positive cases. Despite fluctuations, the ratio of positive specimens has more than doubled from the beginning (0.13%) to the end of the period (0.24%), suggesting a growing prevalence of influenza. Influenza B has seen a more significant increase in positivity ratio, rising from 0.08% to 0.18%, which might indicate a shift in the dominant influenza strain as the season progresses. The peak in the number of specimens tested occurred in week 19, which also coincided with one of the highest numbers of positive cases for both Influenza A and B, highlighting the need for continued testing and resource allocation. The gradual increase in positive ratios, especially for Influenza B, may necessitate heightened public health measures, increased vaccination efforts, and healthcare system preparedness for managing a larger influx of influenza patients.
