Over the last 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperature has shown a gradual increase after an initial decrease, suggesting a warming trend as the day progressed. Humidity levels varied significantly but generally decreased towards the end of the period, which may have contributed to clearer conditions and potentially lower perceived temperatures. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with only slight fluctuations that are unlikely to have had a major impact on weather patterns. Wind speeds were generally moderate but showed some increase later in the period, which could have influenced the dispersion of any fog or low cloud cover typical for the region. The wind direction was mostly westerly with some variability, which is common for coastal San Francisco and can affect coastal and inland temperature differences.
