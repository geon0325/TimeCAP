Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature, with a general trend of gradual increase towards the latter part of the day. Humidity levels have varied significantly, with a noticeable increase during the night and early morning hours, indicative of potentially more muggy conditions. Air pressure showed a sharp rise, suggesting the passage of a frontal system that could have been associated with changing weather patterns, including the possibility of clearer skies following the front's movement. Wind speeds remained relatively constant and light, unlikely to contribute to significant wind chill effects or cause disruptions. The wind direction shifted more westerly throughout the day, consistent with the passage of a weather front and the subsequent movement of air masses.
