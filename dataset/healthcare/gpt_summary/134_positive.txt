Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a fluctuating trend in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with an overall average positivity rate of 6.26%. Notably, the ratio of positive specimens for Influenza A has generally decreased from an initial 2.02% to 1.29% in the most recent week, suggesting a declining trend in Influenza A cases. However, the ratio of positive specimens for Influenza B started at a higher rate of 4.24% and dropped more significantly to 0.40%, which indicates a substantial decrease in Influenza B infections over the period. The total number of specimens tested peaked at 17,095 in the first week and reached its lowest at 6,879 in week 10, with a subsequent gradual increase to 12,030 by the last week, which may reflect seasonal variations or changes in testing practices. This data suggests a potential easing of the influenza burden on the healthcare system, but continued monitoring is essential to anticipate and manage any future fluctuations in disease activity.
