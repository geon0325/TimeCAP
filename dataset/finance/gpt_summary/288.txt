Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has experienced significant volatility with a marked downtrend, reaching a low of 2237.40 from a high of 3130.12, indicating a bearish market sentiment. Correspondingly, the VIX, or Volatility Index, spiked to a peak of 82.69, suggesting heightened market stress, though it has since retreated somewhat. In international markets, both the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 showed similar declines, with the FTSE 100 falling below the 5000 mark, reflecting widespread investor concerns. Commodity prices also faced turbulence; Crude Oil Futures plunged to as low as 20.37, a stark contrast to earlier levels near 50, while Gold Futures initially dropped but recently rebounded to 1567.00, asserting its status as a potential safe-haven asset. Exchange rates have seen the USD strengthening against the EUR and JPY but weakening against the CNY, suggesting a complex currency dynamic that could influence international trade and capital flows.
