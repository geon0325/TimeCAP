Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, peaking during the late afternoon before slightly receding in the evening, typical of the diurnal temperature cycle. Concurrently, humidity levels showed a decreasing trend through the day, which is common as temperatures rise and the capacity of air to hold moisture increases. Air pressure exhibited fluctuations but notably increased significantly during the early morning hours, suggesting the potential influence of a transient high-pressure system. Wind speeds increased towards the end of the period, reaching their peak in the evening, indicating a possible weather front moving in that could bring changes in weather conditions. Wind direction was primarily from the south, shifting towards the south-west later in the day, which in Houston could be associated with warmer air being drawn in from the Gulf of Mexico.
