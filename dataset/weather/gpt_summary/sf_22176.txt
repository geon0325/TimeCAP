Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperature has displayed a slight fluctuating trend, starting and ending the period at a relatively higher point with a dip in the middle of the time frame, suggesting a typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels experienced a gradual decrease throughout the day, which is indicative of drier air moving into the area. The air pressure has been steadily increasing, which is often associated with the approach of a high-pressure system, leading to more stable weather conditions. Wind speeds remained fairly consistent, with a slight decrease observed later in the period, which may reduce the wind chill effect slightly. The wind direction shifted from westerly to northwesterly, which could be influencing the local temperature and humidity levels due to maritime influences.
