Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable decrease in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a peak positivity rate of 12.35% in week 1 declining to 1.68% in week 20. Influenza A showed a more pronounced decrease in positivity rate compared to Influenza B, with its highest at 5.65% reducing to 1.10%, suggesting a relative containment of Influenza A. However, both subtypes have shown a slight increase in the positivity rate in the last few weeks, indicating a potential uptick in influenza cases. The overall average positivity rate of 6.26% suggests that influenza has been relatively stable over the period, but healthcare providers should remain vigilant for possible surges. The observed trends and recent increases in positivity rates could have implications for resource allocation and public health strategies, including vaccination and antiviral stockpiling.
