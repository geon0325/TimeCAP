Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has exhibited significant volatility, with a noticeable downward trend culminating in a drop from 4008.01 to 3749.63, which has been mirrored by a sharp increase in the VIX, rising from 27.47 to 34.02, signaling heightened market uncertainty and potential investor fear. Concurrently, the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 also reflected this instability, with the Nikkei 225 showing some resilience but ultimately declining to 26987.44, while the FTSE 100 trended downwards more consistently from 7464.80 to 7205.80. Gold Futures, typically seen as a safe-haven asset, peaked at 1866.50 mid-period but ended at 1828.00, suggesting a sell-off despite the broader market turbulence. Crude Oil Futures remained relatively stable with bullish sentiment, fluctuating around the $110-$120 mark, which may indicate ongoing concerns about supply constraints or geopolitical tensions. Exchange rates displayed a slight weakening of the USD against the JPY and CNY, yet it remained relatively flat against the EUR, indicating mixed investor sentiment in currency markets and potential shifts in regional economic outlooks.
