Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has exhibited a diurnal cycle with a peak during the afternoon and a trough in the early morning hours, consistent with typical daytime heating and nighttime cooling. Humidity levels have varied significantly, reaching saturation at one point, which could have implications for fog or dew formation, especially when coinciding with cooler temperatures. Air pressure has remained relatively stable with a slight increasing trend, possibly indicating stable weather conditions, though a recent slight decrease could suggest a minor change in the pattern. Wind speeds have been mostly light to moderate, with occasional gusts that could enhance the feeling of lower temperatures during cooler periods. The wind direction has shown variability, with notable shifts that could influence local temperature distribution and possibly contribute to changes in humidity levels due to the transportation of air masses from different origins.
