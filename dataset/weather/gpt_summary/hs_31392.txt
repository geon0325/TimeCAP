Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have shown a slight decreasing trend from moderate warmth to cooler conditions, particularly during the nighttime. Humidity levels were consistently high, peaking at saturation, indicating a significant amount of moisture in the air, which could contribute to a feeling of mugginess and potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase towards the latter part of the period, suggesting steady atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds varied, with some higher gusts occurring, which could have dispersed humidity somewhat, although no sustained high winds were noted. Wind direction experienced notable shifts, including a period of northerly winds, which is often associated with the transport of cooler air masses, possibly contributing to the cooler temperatures observed.
