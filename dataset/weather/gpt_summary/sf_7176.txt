Over the last 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a noticeable decrease in temperature from the day's peak, followed by a slight rise towards the current hour, indicating a typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels have shown significant fluctuations, with a peak during the night which is common due to cooler temperatures and radiative cooling leading to condensation, but then decreased sharply, possibly due to increased daytime heating and mixing of the air. Air pressure has been relatively stable, with a slight dip recently, which may suggest a minor change in the weather pattern or the approach of a weather front. Wind speeds have remained light throughout the period, with little variation, which could lead to the persistence of any current weather conditions. Wind direction has varied, oscillating between southwesterly and northerly directions, which might be indicative of local sea breezes or passing weather systems influencing the local wind patterns.
