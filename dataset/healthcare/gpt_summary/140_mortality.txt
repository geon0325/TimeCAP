Over the last 20 weeks, mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia as a percentage of total deaths has exhibited a rising trend, starting at 4.90% and increasing to 7.46%, which surpasses the average ratio of 7.84% in the most recent weeks. There has been a notable spike in deaths attributed specifically to influenza, escalating sharply from 16 to 498 cases. Meanwhile, pneumonia-related deaths also increased but at a more gradual pace, from 2515 to 3905 cases. This upward trajectory in mortality rates may indicate a growing impact of these respiratory illnesses on public health, potentially signaling a need for increased healthcare resources and preventative measures. The rise in deaths from these causes could strain healthcare systems, particularly if the trend continues or coincides with other seasonal or pandemic-related health challenges.
