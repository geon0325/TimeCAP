The analysis of the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data over the last 20 weeks indicates a consistent trend below the baseline threshold of 2.9% for ILI patient ratios, suggesting that ILI incidence is not at an alarming level within the observed timeframe. However, there is a notable gradual increase in the ratio of ILI patients toward the end of the period, hinting at a possible uptick in ILI activity that warrants close monitoring. The age group of 0-4 years old consistently presents the highest number of ILI cases compared to other age groups, highlighting the importance of vigilance and targeted preventive measures for this demographic. The overall number of patients has experienced fluctuations, with an initial decrease followed by a resurgence, an indication of the non-static nature of healthcare demand. Given these trends, healthcare providers should remain prepared for potential increases in ILI cases, especially among the youngest age group, and consider the gradual increase in ILI ratios as a sign that could precede reaching the baseline if current trends continue.
