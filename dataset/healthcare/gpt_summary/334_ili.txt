Over the last 20 weeks, the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data has shown a progressive increase in the overall percentage of ILI patients, peaking mid-period before showing signs of a gradual decrease. The age group of 5-24 years has demonstrated the highest surge in ILI cases, which may indicate higher transmission rates in schools or among young adults. Notably, while the oldest age group (65 or more) has the lowest number of ILI cases, their susceptibility to complications underscores the importance of monitoring and prevention efforts in this demographic. Despite the mid-period peak, the ILI patient ratio has remained below the baseline threshold, suggesting that the healthcare system has not been overwhelmed by ILI cases during this period. However, as the data indicates fluctuations in ILI activity, continued vigilance and preparedness are essential to promptly address potential increases in healthcare demand.
