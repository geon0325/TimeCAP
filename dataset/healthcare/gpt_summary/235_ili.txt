Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable upward trend in the number of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases across all age groups, with a significant surge observed in the most recent weeks. The ratio of ILI patients to the total number of patients has incrementally increased, finally surpassing the baseline threshold of 2.9% in the last week of reporting, indicating a potential outbreak situation. The youngest (0-4 years) and school-age (5-24 years) populations have experienced the most substantial increases in ILI cases, which may be attributed to high transmission rates in communal settings such as daycare centers and schools. The progressive rise in ILI cases in adults (25-49 years) and older populations (50-64 years, and 65 or more years) suggests that the illness is affecting a broad demographic, which could lead to increased healthcare utilization and strain on healthcare resources. The observed trend necessitates close monitoring and potentially increased healthcare preparedness, including vaccination efforts, public health messaging, and resource allocation to manage the rising ILI incidence.
