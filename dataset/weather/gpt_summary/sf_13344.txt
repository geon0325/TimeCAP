Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a gradual decrease in temperature followed by a moderate increase, suggesting a typical diurnal variation with cooler temperatures in the early hours and a warming trend during the day. Humidity levels have fluctuated significantly, reaching very high levels which could have contributed to foggy conditions, particularly when combined with the cooler night and early morning temperatures. Air pressure remained relatively stable for most of the period but showed a noticeable drop towards the end of the time series, which could indicate the approach of a weather system that might alter current conditions. Wind speeds varied from light to moderate throughout the day, with the higher wind speeds possibly leading to cooler perceived temperatures and the dispersal of any early fog. Wind direction was predominantly from the west to northwest, which is typical for San Francisco's climate and could have influenced the coastal temperature and humidity patterns observed.
