The time-series data over the last 20 weeks indicates a general decline in the number of patients presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI) across all age groups until a recent uptick. The lowest ratio of ILI patients was observed midway through the period, falling well below the baseline of 2.9% used to determine the severity of influenza activity. Notably, in the most recent weeks, there has been a gradual increase in the ILI ratio, suggesting a potential resurgence of ILI cases, which could signal the onset of a seasonal increase or an outbreak. The age group 5-24 has shown a more pronounced recent increase in ILI cases compared to other age groups. Healthcare systems should be alert to this trend and prepare for a potential increase in demand for medical services, especially in pediatrics and general medicine, to address the needs of these age groups.
