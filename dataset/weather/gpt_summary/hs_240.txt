In the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature during the day, which is typical for the area, with a peak in the late afternoon before cooling slightly at night. The relative humidity remained consistently high throughout the majority of the day, which likely contributed to a muggy feel in the air, but there was a noticeable drop during the afternoon hours when the temperature peaked. Atmospheric pressure stayed relatively stable, with a slight increase midday, indicating stable weather conditions without significant frontal changes. Wind speeds varied, with calm conditions during the early morning and late evening, and breezier conditions in the afternoon, which might have provided some relief from the high humidity. Wind direction was predominantly from the south to southeast, shifting to a more variable direction later in the evening, which is consistent with the Gulf of Mexico's influence on Houston's weather patterns.
