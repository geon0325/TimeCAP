Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the mortality ratio of Influenza or Pneumonia compared to total deaths, with a peak at 18.51% and a decrease to 6.37% by the end of the period. The data indicates a significant surge in deaths attributed to pneumonia rather than influenza, with pneumonia deaths reaching a high of 16,037 in one week, whereas influenza deaths peaked at 187 in a different week. Despite the overall mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia remaining above the average of 7.84%, there has been a downward trend in recent weeks, suggesting a potential easing of the burden on healthcare services related to these illnesses. However, the persistently high proportion of deaths due to pneumonia necessitates continued vigilance and resources allocation in the healthcare system to manage and prevent such respiratory infections. The observed trends underscore the importance of monitoring respiratory illness patterns to inform public health strategies and healthcare preparedness.
