Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a notable increase in temperature reaching a peak before slightly dropping again, indicative of typical diurnal variation with a warm afternoon. Humidity levels exhibited fluctuations, starting at moderate levels, decreasing towards the latter part of the day, and then increasing again, which could have affected the comfort levels and perhaps the occurrence of morning and evening fog typical to the area. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day with a slight decrease towards the evening, suggesting a stable weather pattern but the decrease could signal an approaching weather system. Wind speeds varied, with a significant increase in the early hours, which then stabilized at lower speeds, suggesting a breezy condition that temporarily intensified. Wind directions were variable, with a general shift from westerly to northerly directions, which may influence coastal conditions and temperature distribution within the city.
