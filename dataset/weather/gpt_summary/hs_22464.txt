Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have demonstrated a slight fluctuation before a notable increase, leading to above-average warmth for the area. Humidity levels have shown a gradual decrease through the period, which, combined with rising temperatures, suggests a trend towards drier conditions. Air pressure has been gently declining, which could indicate an approaching weather system that may bring changes in the current weather pattern. The wind speed has been relatively steady at first but has increased slightly in the later hours, suggesting an intensification of the weather system. Meanwhile, wind direction has remained predominantly from the south-southeast, which is typical for Houston and could be contributing to the increase in temperatures.
