Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a noticeable increase in temperature, which peaked during the afternoon hours before gradually decreasing towards the evening. Despite this temperature rise, humidity levels decreased significantly as the temperature reached its maximum, suggesting a drier air mass moving into the area. Air pressure remained relatively stable with only minor fluctuations, indicating a lack of strong weather systems passing through the region. Wind speeds were consistently light throughout the day, with no significant gusts that would typically accompany stormy conditions. The wind direction varied but predominantly came from the west and northwest, with a notable shift to the north and then veering to the southwest towards the end of the 24-hour period, which could signal a change in the incoming weather system.
