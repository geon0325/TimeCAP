Over the last 24 hours in New York City, the temperature experienced a notable spike in the afternoon, transitioning from cold to significantly warmer conditions. The humidity levels fluctuated, initially decreasing before rising later in the day, which could have contributed to a feeling of increased chilliness in the morning and potential for denser air later on. Atmospheric pressure showed a general downward trend, indicating a potential shift in weather patterns, possibly leading to unsettled weather conditions. Wind speeds remained consistently calm throughout the period, suggesting limited impact on the overall feel of the weather. However, the wind direction varied substantially, with shifts from southerly to westerly, then to northerly and eventually to easterly, which could have implications for localized weather phenomena and temperature distribution across the city.
