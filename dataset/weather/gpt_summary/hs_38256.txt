Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, culminating in a peak during the later hours of the day before slightly decreasing again. Humidity levels started relatively high but showed a significant decrease through the day, which suggests drier conditions as the temperature rose. Air pressure remained relatively stable initially but saw a gradual increase, indicating a potential shift towards more stable weather conditions. Wind speeds varied moderately throughout the day, with a notable increase in the final hours, while the predominant wind direction shifted between southerly to southwesterly, with occasional variations. These conditions are indicative of a typical weather pattern for Houston, with daytime heating leading to increased temperatures and decreased humidity, while the stable air pressure and variable winds suggest no immediate signs of significant weather disruptions.
