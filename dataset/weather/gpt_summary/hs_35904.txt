Over the last 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has exhibited a typical diurnal pattern with a peak during the afternoon and a gradual decline towards the early morning hours. Humidity levels have shown variability, with notably higher levels during the early morning hours, which is common due to lower temperatures and could lead to a feeling of increased mugginess or potential for fog formation. Air pressure has remained relatively stable, with a slight decrease observed in the later hours, which could suggest a minor change in weather patterns, possibly indicating an approaching weather system. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate throughout the day, with a noticeable increase in the evening, which could contribute to a slight wind chill effect during the night. The wind direction was predominantly from the north to northeast in the earlier hours, shifting to easterly and southerly directions towards the end of the period, which may bring changes in humidity and temperature as air masses shift.
