Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant increase in the ratio of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with an overall average of 6.26% but escalating to 25.13% by the final week. Influenza A has been the predominant strain, showing a marked increase from 1.14% to 24.34% in positive specimen ratios, suggesting a widespread outbreak. Influenza B, while less prevalent, also showed an increase from 0.35% to 0.79% over the same period. The total number of specimens tested has grown substantially, from 14,763 to 54,030, indicating increased surveillance and possibly higher infection rates in the population. This upward trend in influenza cases may strain healthcare resources and necessitates enhanced preparedness for influenza management, including vaccination drives, antiviral stockpiling, and healthcare staffing strategies.
