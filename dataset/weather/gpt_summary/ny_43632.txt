Over the last 24 hours in New York City, temperatures experienced a significant increase during the daytime, reaching their peak in the late afternoon before gradually declining towards the evening, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels showed an inverse relationship with temperature, decreasing as the day warmed up and increasing again as the temperatures fell, which is common as cooler air holds less moisture. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with only minor fluctuations, suggesting a period of stable weather conditions. Wind speeds were mostly light and variable, with a brief period of increased wind speed in the late afternoon, which could have contributed to a temporary cooling effect. The wind direction varied widely, but predominantly it was from the north and northeast, shifting towards the south and southeast in the later hours, which could influence the transportation of air masses and potentially the arrival of different weather conditions.
