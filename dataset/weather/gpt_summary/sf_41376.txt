Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a moderate fluctuation in temperature, beginning and ending the period with relatively warm conditions and seeing a noticeable dip during the early hours. Humidity levels varied significantly, with a peak that coincided with the cooler temperatures, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air which could have resulted in fog or low clouds, typical for the city. Air pressure showed minor fluctuations but remained within a range that indicates relatively stable weather conditions, although a slight drop towards the end of the period could suggest an approaching change in weather patterns. Wind speeds were generally light with a few periods of increased velocity, which may have contributed to changes in humidity and temperature by dispersing moisture and bringing in warmer air from different directions. Overall, the wind direction varied widely throughout the day, indicating shifting weather patterns that are common in coastal cities like San Francisco.
