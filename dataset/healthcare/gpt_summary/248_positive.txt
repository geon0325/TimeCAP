Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a fluctuating but overall increasing trend in the number of specimens tested for influenza, peaking in the most recent week at 38,746 tests. Despite the increase in testing, the ratio of specimens testing positive for influenza has remained relatively stable, averaging around 0.22% in recent weeks, which is slightly below the 20-week average of 0.26%. However, there has been a notable increase in the number of positive specimens for Influenza B, which has surpassed Influenza A in the last two weeks, suggesting a shift in the predominant influenza strain. The highest recorded ratio of positive specimens for Influenza B is 0.14% in the last week, which is almost double the lowest recorded ratio of 0.07% for the same strain in week 3. The healthcare system should be alert to the rising trend in Influenza B cases, which could imply a need for targeted public health interventions and resource allocation to manage potential increases in healthcare demand.
