Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a fluctuating but generally low incidence of positive influenza specimens, averaging a ratio of 6.26%. Influenza B has consistently been more prevalent than Influenza A, with its highest positive specimen ratio of 0.16% in week one, compared to Influenza A's peak of 0.08% in week 18. The overall ratio of positive specimens hit its lowest at 0.07% in weeks 11 and 13 and peaked at 0.21% in the first week. There has been a slight increase in the proportion of positive specimens for both Influenza A and B towards the latter part of the 20-week period, indicating a potential uptick in influenza activity. These patterns suggest that while influenza incidence remains low, healthcare providers should be vigilant for signs of increasing activity, especially for Influenza B, which has been the dominant strain.
