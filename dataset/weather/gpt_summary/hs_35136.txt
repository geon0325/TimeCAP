Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has shown moderate variation, initially decreasing slightly before rising significantly during the later hours, indicating a warming trend. Humidity levels started high and saw a slight decrease towards the end of the period, which could suggest a lessening of the muggy conditions typically experienced in the area. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight increase in the middle of the period, which could be indicative of a transient high-pressure system affecting the region. Wind speeds were mostly light to gentle and decreased during the middle of the time frame before picking up again, maintaining mostly a southeasterly to southerly direction, which is common for Houston and may contribute to the warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. Overall, the combination of rising temperatures and varying humidity suggests that Houston may be experiencing typical warm and humid conditions with no significant weather disturbances indicated by the relatively steady air pressure and gentle winds.
