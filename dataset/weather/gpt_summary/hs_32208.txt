Over the past day, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, peaking in the late afternoon before a modest decline during the night. Humidity levels started at saturation point before showing a significant decrease through the afternoon hours, which could have led to a more comfortable feeling despite the rising temperatures, but eventually increased again towards the evening. Air pressure remained relatively stable with only minor fluctuations, suggesting a stable weather pattern without significant frontal changes. Wind speed varied slightly, with some hours experiencing gentle to moderate breezes, while the predominant direction was from the northeast, shifting occasionally. The combination of high humidity and stable pressure indicates that there might be a likelihood of cloud formation or fog, especially during periods of peak humidity.
