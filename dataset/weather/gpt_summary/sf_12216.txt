Over the last 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperature exhibited a typical diurnal cycle with a rise towards the afternoon followed by a nighttime drop and a subsequent increase again after dawn. Humidity levels were relatively high throughout the period, intensifying during the cooler early morning hours which could have led to instances of fog or mist, particularly common in the San Francisco Bay area. Air pressure remained fairly stable, with a slight increase in the middle of the period indicating steady weather conditions without significant frontal activity. Wind speeds varied, generally remaining light to moderate, but there were brief periods of calmer conditions which could have resulted in less dispersion of pollutants and thus poorer air quality. The wind direction was predominantly from the west and northwest, which is characteristic of the region's prevailing maritime airflow, but there were also some variable shifts in direction that occurred during the period.
