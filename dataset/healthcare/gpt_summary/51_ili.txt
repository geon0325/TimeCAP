Analysis of the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data over the last 20 weeks reveals a fluctuating trend in the number of ILI cases across different age groups. Early in the period, the ratio of ILI patients was below the baseline level but subsequently crossed the threshold, indicating a peak in ILI activity that surpassed the baseline for several weeks before declining again. The age groups of 0-4 and 5-24 years showed the highest counts of ILI cases, suggesting that these populations were the most affected during this period. Notably, the older age groups (50-64 and 65 or more) consistently reported fewer ILI cases, yet their healthcare needs should not be underestimated due to the potential for complications. As the current ILI patient ratio trends back below the baseline, healthcare systems may experience a temporary reprieve, allowing for resource reallocation and preparation for potential future increases in ILI activity.
