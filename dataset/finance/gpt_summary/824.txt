Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with a general downtrend, closing lower at 4123.34 from an initial value of 4488.28, a sign of investor caution and potential concerns about market stability. This sentiment is mirrored in the VIX, which has risen overall, indicating increased market volatility and risk aversion among investors. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 have also experienced declines, although the Nikkei 225 showed some recovery in the latest session, suggesting regional market variations and resilience in Asian markets. Gold Futures initially rose, reflecting its status as a safe-haven asset during market uncertainty, but ended with a slight retreat, while Crude Oil Futures trended upward, pointing to potential inflationary pressures or geopolitical tensions affecting supply. Currency markets saw the USD strengthen against the EUR and JPY but weaken against the CNY, highlighting shifts in currency dynamics that could influence international trade and investment flows.
