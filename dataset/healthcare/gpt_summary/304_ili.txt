The analysis of the 20-week Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data reveals a general downward trend in the percentage ratio of ILI patients, indicating a decline in ILI cases relative to the total number of patients seen. Notably, the highest ILI percentages were observed early in the timeframe, consistently exceeding the baseline, but the recent weeks have shown ratios below the threshold, suggesting a potential easing of the ILI burden on healthcare resources. However, ILI occurrences among the youngest age group (0-4 years) have increased in recent weeks, which could signal a need for focused healthcare interventions and monitoring within this demographic. The age groups 25-49 and 50-64 have experienced a decrease in ILI cases over the period, which may reflect the effectiveness of public health measures or natural fluctuations in disease spread. Despite the overall decrease in ILI percentages, healthcare systems should remain vigilant, particularly for the youngest and oldest populations where ILI cases have not fallen as sharply, to ensure adequate response to potential surges and to maintain public health.
