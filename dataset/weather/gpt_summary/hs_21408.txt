Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has shown a gradual increasing trend, indicating a slight warming pattern. Humidity levels remained exceptionally high throughout the period, often reaching saturation, which suggests a heavy presence of moisture in the air that could lead to fog or mist formation, particularly during the cooler nighttime and early morning hours. Air pressure has been relatively stable with a slight fluctuation, implying steady weather conditions without the immediate likelihood of significant weather disturbances. Wind speeds have been mostly light to gentle, and the wind direction has undergone a gradual shift from a northerly to a more northwesterly direction, which could be associated with the passage of a weak frontal system or local breeze effects. The combination of high humidity, stable pressure, and light winds may lead to a consistent weather pattern, though the potential for localized weather events such as fog cannot be ruled out.
