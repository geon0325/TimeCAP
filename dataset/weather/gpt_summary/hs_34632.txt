Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before a slight decline towards the evening. Concurrently, humidity levels showed significant variation, starting high in the early hours, decreasing sharply midday, and then moderately rising again in the evening. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with only slight fluctuations which are typical for the region and indicate stable weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a notable increase observed later in the day, suggesting the possibility of a weather front moving through the area. The wind direction varied, predominantly coming from the east and shifting towards the west later on, which is consistent with the passage of a weather system across Houston.
