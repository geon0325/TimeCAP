Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown moderate fluctuations, with a downward trend in the most recent days, closing lower than the period's opening, suggesting a cautious market sentiment. The VIX, or Volatility Index, has generally increased, particularly spiking alongside significant drops in the S&P 500, indicating heightened market volatility and investor anxiety during this time. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 both trended downwards, with the Nikkei closing significantly lower, reinforcing the view of a global market retreat. Gold Futures prices increased, peaking on days corresponding with higher VIX readings, which suggests investors are turning to traditional safe-haven assets amidst market uncertainty. Meanwhile, the exchange rates for EUR/USD and USD/JPY have remained relatively stable, with a slight weakening of the USD against the JPY, while USD/CNY has seen a slight increase, reflecting potential concerns over trade tensions or shifts in monetary policy expectations.
