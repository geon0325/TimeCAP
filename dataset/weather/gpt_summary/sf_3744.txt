Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperature experienced a slight fluctuation, showing a gradual decrease before a modest increase towards the later hours. Humidity levels varied moderately, with a rise during the early hours indicating increased moisture in the air, followed by a significant drop which could have led to more comfortable conditions. Air pressure saw a general increase throughout the period, suggesting the possible build-up of a high-pressure system that could lead to stable and drier weather conditions. Wind speeds were predominantly moderate but showed an increase in intensity during the middle of the timeframe, which could have contributed to a wind chill effect, making it feel cooler than the actual temperature. The wind direction shifted from south to west over the course of the day, which is typical for coastal areas like San Francisco and can influence fog and coastal weather patterns.
