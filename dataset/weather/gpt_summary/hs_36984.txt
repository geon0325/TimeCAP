Over the past day in Houston, the temperature showed a clear warming trend, rising from cooler conditions in the early hours to much warmer temperatures by the evening. Humidity levels varied significantly, starting low, peaking in the early morning which could have led to a feeling of dampness or morning dew, and then fluctuating throughout the day. Air pressure experienced a gradual decline, which might indicate an approaching weather system that could alter current conditions. Wind speeds were mostly light, but increased towards the end of the period, suggesting that the weather could become windier. The wind direction was variable, though predominantly from the south to southeast, which is typical for bringing in warmer air masses to the Houston area.
