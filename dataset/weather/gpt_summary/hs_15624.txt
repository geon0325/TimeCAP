Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a slight decrease in temperatures, which then rose again toward the end of the period, indicating a typical diurnal pattern. Humidity levels were very high, often reaching saturation, particularly during the cooler early hours, which could have led to fog or mist conditions. Air pressure showed a slight decreasing trend, which might suggest the approach of a weather system that could bring changes in the weather. Wind speeds varied, with some hours experiencing calm conditions and others more breezy, and the predominant wind direction shifted significantly from southeasterly to northerly by the end of the period, potentially signaling a frontal passage. The combination of high humidity, changing wind directions, and decreasing pressure may lead to increased chances of precipitation and shifting weather patterns in the near future.
