Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced relatively stable temperatures with a slight cooling trend, indicating a consistent weather pattern. However, humidity levels remained high throughout the period, reaching saturation at several points, which could have resulted in foggy conditions or a heavy sense of moisture in the air. The air pressure showed a gradual increase, suggesting the possible onset of a high-pressure system that could lead to clearer skies and calmer weather. Wind speeds were mostly light to gentle, with some variability in direction, which is typical of a region not currently dominated by a strong weather front. The combination of high humidity and stable air pressure, along with gentle wind speeds, may have led to muggy conditions without significant weather disturbances.
