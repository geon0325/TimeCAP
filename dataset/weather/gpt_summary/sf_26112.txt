Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, with a significant drop overnight before modestly rising again in the daytime. Humidity levels showed variations, with notably higher levels during the early morning hours, which suggests the presence of morning fog, a common occurrence in this region. Air pressure readings were relatively stable; however, a sharp spike was observed during the day, indicating a possible brief high-pressure system moving through the area. Wind speeds remained generally low to moderate, with a sudden, extreme wind speed peak that could have been associated with a transient weather event, such as a passing squall. Wind direction was predominantly from the west-northwest, which is typical for San Francisco's maritime climate, but a few shifts in direction occurred, likely affecting localized weather conditions.
