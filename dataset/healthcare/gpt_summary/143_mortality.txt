Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality due to Influenza or Pneumonia as a percentage of total deaths has shown an increasing trend, starting at 5.69% and rising to a peak of 7.64% before slightly decreasing to 7.49% in the latest week. The absolute number of deaths attributed to Influenza or Pneumonia has also increased, with deaths from Influenza rising from 10 to 560 and those from Pneumonia from 2969 to 3839. This trend indicates a growing impact of these respiratory conditions on overall mortality. Notably, there was a sharp rise in Influenza deaths from week 13 to 14, where the number more than tripled from 141 to 432. The overall trend suggests a potential strain on healthcare resources and underlines the importance of preventive measures, especially considering that the observed mortality ratio has consistently stayed below the average ratio of 7.84% only until the last four weeks, where it exceeded this threshold.
