Over the past 24 hours in New York City, there has been a gradual decrease in temperature, with a notable dip into cooler ranges, suggesting a potential onset of colder weather. Humidity levels have experienced significant fluctuations, including a spike to full saturation, which could have led to fog or precipitation events during that time period. Air pressure has been steadily increasing, indicative of a high-pressure system moving into the area, which is generally associated with more stable and clearer weather conditions. Wind speeds have varied but remained moderately strong throughout the period, with gusts potentially affecting loose objects and creating a wind chill effect that could make it feel colder than actual temperatures. The wind has been predominantly coming from the west and southwest, which is typical for this region and could contribute to the transport of cooler air from those directions into the city.
