Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has experienced significant volatility, with a notable drop from 4108.54 to a low of 3749.63, before partially recovering to 3825.33, reflecting potential investor uncertainty and a cautious market sentiment. The VIX, or fear index, has mirrored this uncertainty, with a peak at 34.02 indicating heightened market stress, though it has since decreased to 26.70, suggesting a slight easing of investor concerns. International markets have also faced pressure, as evidenced by the Nikkei 225's decline from 27761.57 to 25935.62, and the FTSE 100's fluctuation, ending with a slight decrease to 7168.70. Commodity prices have seen mixed movements, with Gold Futures trending downward to 1798.90, indicating a possible shift away from safe havens, while Crude Oil Futures have fluctuated but remained relatively high at 108.43, possibly adding to inflationary pressures. Currency exchanges have remained fairly stable, with minor fluctuations in the EUR/USD, USD/JPY, and USD/CNY, suggesting that currency markets have not overreacted to equity and commodity market volatilities.
