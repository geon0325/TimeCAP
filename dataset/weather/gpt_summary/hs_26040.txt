Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual increase in temperature which peaked in the late afternoon before slightly declining towards the evening. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, starting relatively high in the early hours, reaching saturation at one point, and then decreasing as temperatures rose, indicating a possible correlation between temperature and moisture in the air. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout most of the day with a notable increase around midday, which could suggest a transient high-pressure system affecting the area. Wind speeds were generally light and variable, with a slight increase in the late afternoon, which might have contributed to a dispersal of humidity and a decrease in temperature during the evening. Wind direction varied, predominantly coming from a southerly direction earlier in the day, shifting towards an easterly direction later on, which could have influenced the moisture transport and temperature distribution in Houston.
