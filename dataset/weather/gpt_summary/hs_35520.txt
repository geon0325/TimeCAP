Humidity levels showed a marked decrease through the day, which indicates drier air moving into the area. Air pressure remained relatively high and stable, with only slight fluctuations, suggesting steady weather conditions without the immediate influence of any significant weather fronts. Wind speeds were consistent and moderate, with a slight decrease towards the end of the period, which could have contributed to the drop in humidity as winds often disperse moisture.
