Over the last 20 weeks, the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) activity has consistently remained below the 2.9% severity benchmark, indicating a mild influenza season. The highest ratio of ILI patients was 2.44% in the second week, with a gradual decline observed since then. The week-over-week data shows a persistent decrease in ILI cases across all age groups, with the most significant reductions seen in the youngest (0-4 years) and school-aged children (5-24 years), which are typically high transmission groups for influenza. The consistent downward trend has led to the latest ratio of ILI patients falling to 1.19%, which is less than half of the threshold for severity. This declining trend suggests a currently low burden on the healthcare system from influenza, but continuous monitoring remains essential to detect any potential changes in the ILI activity levels.
