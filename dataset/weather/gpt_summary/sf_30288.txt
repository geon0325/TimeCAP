Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a moderate fluctuation in temperature, with a noticeable cooling trend during the night that warmed up as the day progressed. Humidity levels showed significant variation, starting low, sharply increasing, and then dropping to very low levels towards the current period. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with only slight variations that are typical for this coastal city. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate and predominantly came from the west-northwest direction, with occasional shifts to northerly and easterly directions. The combination of low humidity, stable pressure, and consistent wind patterns suggests fair weather conditions, but the low humidity could increase discomfort and the risk of fire danger in the area.
