Over the past 20 weeks, the data reveals that the number of respiratory specimens tested for influenza has been on a steady rise, with a significant increase from 10,662 to 17,827 tests performed. Despite this increase in testing, the average ratio of positive specimens (6.26%) remains above the observed ratios, which peaked at 3.39% in week one and was lowest at 1.34% in week 11. The prevalence of Influenza A has generally trended upwards, with the positive specimen ratio for Influenza A increasing from 1.28% to 1.56% by the end of the 20-week period. In contrast, Influenza B showed a decrease in the proportion of positive specimens, starting at 2.11% and decreasing to 0.62%, suggesting a potential shift in the dominant influenza strain. These trends indicate that while overall influenza activity, as measured by the proportion of positive tests, is below the average, there is a rising trend in Influenza A infections that could have implications for healthcare resource allocation and public health interventions.
