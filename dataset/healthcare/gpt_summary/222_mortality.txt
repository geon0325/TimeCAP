Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable increase in the proportion of deaths attributed to influenza or pneumonia, relative to total deaths, starting from 8.40% and rising sharply to 16.00%. This upward trend in the ratio significantly exceeds the average of 7.84%, suggesting a worsening impact of these respiratory illnesses on mortality rates. The number of deaths from pneumonia has shown a concerning escalation from 4952 to 11500, while deaths from influenza remained relatively stable but slightly increased towards the end of the period. The total number of deaths has also increased over this timeframe, from 59020 to 71976, indicating a growing burden on the healthcare system. The substantial rise in the mortality ratio due to influenza or pneumonia could signal potential outbreaks or increased virulence requiring urgent healthcare attention and resources.
