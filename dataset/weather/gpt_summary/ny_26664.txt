Humidity levels have shown significant fluctuations, with a noteworthy peak that coincided with the lowest temperature, suggesting possible early morning fog or dew. Atmospheric pressure has remained relatively stable, with a slight increasing trend, which is indicative of steady weather conditions and the absence of significant weather fronts moving through the area. Wind speeds varied moderately, with an increase during the latter part of the period, potentially affecting the wind chill factor and making it feel colder than the actual temperature. The wind direction has been predominantly from the northwest, with occasional shifts, which is common for the region and can influence the transport of air masses, potentially affecting temperatures and precipitation patterns.
