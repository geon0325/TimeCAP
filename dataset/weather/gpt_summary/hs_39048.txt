Over the last 24 hours, Houston experienced a slight decrease in temperature followed by a gradual increase towards the latter part of the day, indicating a typical diurnal pattern. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, reaching saturation at one point, which could have led to fog or mist formation, especially when the temperature was low. Air pressure remained relatively stable with only minor variations, suggesting steady weather conditions without the presence of any significant frontal systems. Wind speeds varied from light to moderate throughout the day, with the highest speeds observed in the evening hours, which could have contributed to a more significant wind chill effect as temperatures were rising. The wind direction was predominantly from the south to south-east, which is typical for Houston and may have brought in moisture from the Gulf, affecting the humidity levels.
