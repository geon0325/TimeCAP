Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a general decline in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the overall positivity ratio decreasing from a high of 19.71% to 1.95%. This trend is reflected in both Influenza A and B, where the positivity rates dropped from 9.15% to 1.43% and 10.56% to 0.52%, respectively. Notably, the reduction in the ratio of positive specimens is more pronounced for Influenza B, which initially had a higher positivity rate than Influenza A but now exhibits a lower rate. Despite a decrease in the number of specimens tested over the 20-week period, from 35,188 to 6,725, the decrease in positivity rates suggests a genuine reduction in influenza incidence rather than a change due to testing volume alone. Healthcare providers should remain vigilant but may anticipate a decrease in influenza-related healthcare demand if current trends continue.
