Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has seen a gradual decrease, indicating a cooling trend which reached its lowest point towards the end of the observed period. The humidity levels have remained high throughout, often reaching saturation, which suggests a likelihood of fog or mist, particularly when coupled with the observed drop in temperature. Air pressure experienced a slight fluctuation but generally decreased, which could be indicative of an approaching weather system that may bring changes in the near future. Wind speeds were mostly steady with a slight increase later on, while the wind direction shifted significantly, moving from a predominately southeastern flow to a more northwesterly direction by the end of the period. This shift in wind direction, along with the changes in other weather indicators, could signal the arrival of a cold front, potentially leading to clearer skies but cooler temperatures.
