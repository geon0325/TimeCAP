Over the past 24 hours in New York City, the temperature showed a gradual increase, reaching a peak in the later hours before a slight decrease towards the end of the observed period. Humidity levels varied significantly, starting low, spiking in the middle of the period, and then reaching the highest levels towards the end, which could indicate an increased chance of precipitation or fog. Air pressure experienced a steady decline throughout the day, which often suggests an approaching weather system that could bring unsettled weather conditions. Wind speeds were mostly moderate but did see an increase around the middle of the period, potentially contributing to a wind chill effect that could make the temperatures feel colder. The wind direction shifted from predominantly westerly to southerly, which could be associated with the transportation of warmer air masses towards the area, influencing the slight temperature rise observed.
