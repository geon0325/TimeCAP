Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable upward trend in the number of patients presenting with Influenza-like Illness (ILI) across all age groups, with the most significant increases observed in the youngest (0-4 years) and school-aged children (5-24 years). This trend has led to a gradual rise in the ILI ratio, which remains below the baseline of 2.9% but has been steadily approaching this threshold. The sustained increase in ILI cases, particularly among the younger population, could indicate a wider spread of influenza or ILI-related viruses, warranting close monitoring and potentially increased healthcare resources to manage the demand. The data suggests that there could be a growing need for preventive measures, such as vaccination and public health campaigns, especially aimed at the most affected age groups. While the ILI ratio has not yet surpassed the baseline, the consistent upward trajectory signals the potential for an impending healthcare strain if the trend continues.
