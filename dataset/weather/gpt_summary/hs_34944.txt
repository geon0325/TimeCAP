Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature exhibited a typical diurnal pattern, starting off cooler in the early hours, peaking in the afternoon, and then gradually cooling down towards the evening. Humidity levels started high and saw a slight decrease midday, which is expected as temperatures rise, but increased again as the temperatures began to drop, indicating a possible sense of mugginess in the air. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with only minor fluctuations that are not indicative of significant weather changes such as storms or fronts moving in. Wind speeds were consistently light and showed no significant gusts that would suggest any immediate weather disturbances. Wind direction was variable but predominantly from the north-northeast, which is typical for this region and does not suggest any unusual weather patterns at present.
