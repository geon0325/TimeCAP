Over the past 20 weeks, the data reflects a significant upward trend in the incidence of Influenza-like Illness (ILI), with the proportion of ILI cases rising from 1.65% to 6.83%. The ILI rates crossed the severity benchmark of 2.9% in week 13 and peaked at 7.37% in week 18. Notably, the age groups 0-4 and 5-24 have experienced the largest increases in ILI cases, indicating that these populations may be particularly vulnerable and could be a focal point for public health interventions. The surge in ILI cases has implications for the healthcare system, potentially indicating increased demands on healthcare resources and the need for enhanced surveillance and preventive measures. Given that ILI can be a precursor to more serious health conditions, especially in the elderly and young, the continued monitoring and response to these trends are critical in mitigating the impact on the healthcare infrastructure.
