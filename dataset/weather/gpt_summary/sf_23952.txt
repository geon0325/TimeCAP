Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures exhibited a diurnal pattern, with a peak during the daytime followed by a gradual cooling trend into the night. Humidity levels remained relatively high throughout the period, with a slight decrease during the warmest part of the day, which is typical as warmer air can hold more moisture. Air pressure was stable for the majority of the time but showed a significant drop toward the end of the observed period, which could indicate the approach of a weather system that may lead to changing conditions. Wind speeds varied modestly and were mostly gentle, though there were a few instances of increased wind activity. The wind direction was predominantly from the north and northwest, with occasional shifts, suggesting the presence of varying weather fronts moving through the area.
