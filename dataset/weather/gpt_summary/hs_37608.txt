Over the last 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has shown a general warming trend, peaking during the late afternoon hours as is typical due to diurnal heating. Humidity levels have fluctuated significantly, with notably higher levels during the night and early morning hours, which could have led to a muggy feeling and possibly morning fog. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase towards the afternoon, suggesting steady weather conditions without the presence of strong weather fronts. Wind speeds varied but were generally moderate, and there was an increase in the evening, which could have contributed to a more comfortable feeling by dispersing humidity. The wind direction has been predominantly from the southeast to south, which is common for the region and can bring in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, influencing humidity levels and potentially leading to cloud formation.
