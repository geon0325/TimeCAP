Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a general upward trend in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before stabilizing. Humidity levels were at their highest during the early morning hours, which is typical due to overnight cooling and condensation, but they decreased significantly as temperatures rose, indicating a typical diurnal pattern. Air pressure experienced a gradual decline, suggesting a slight destabilization of the atmosphere which could lead to potential weather changes such as increased cloudiness or precipitation chances. Wind speeds varied modestly, with slight increases towards the latter part of the period, while wind direction shifted significantly throughout the day, indicating variable wind conditions. Overall, the combination of high temperatures, fluctuating humidity, lowering pressure, and changing wind conditions could result in the development of unsettled weather patterns in the region.
