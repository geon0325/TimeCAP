Over the last 24 hours in New York City, temperatures have shown a gradual increasing trend, indicating a slight warming pattern. Humidity levels were extremely high in the earlier part of the period, reaching saturation, but have since shown a notable decrease, suggesting drier air moving into the area. Air pressure has been relatively stable, with a slight increase towards the end of the period, which could signal more settled weather conditions approaching. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate and increased as the day progressed, potentially contributing to the dispersal of earlier high humidity levels. The wind direction varied significantly throughout the period but predominantly came from the south and then shifted to come mainly from the northwest towards the end of the period, which is often associated with the arrival of cooler and drier air masses.
