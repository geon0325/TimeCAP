Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has shown a general upward trend, peaking during the late afternoon and early evening hours, indicative of typical diurnal heating patterns. Humidity levels have fluctuated significantly, with higher humidity in the early morning hours, decreasing as temperatures rose, which is consistent with the inverse relationship between temperature and relative humidity. Air pressure has been declining gradually, suggesting a potential change in the weather system that could lead to unstable weather conditions or a higher chance of precipitation. Wind speeds have remained relatively light and fairly consistent throughout the period, with no significant gusts that would indicate strong weather systems. The wind direction has varied but has generally been from the south to south-east, which in Houston can bring in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and contribute to higher humidity levels and potential cloud formation.
