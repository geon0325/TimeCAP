Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a progressive increase in the percentage of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) patients across all age groups, with a peak that eventually surpassed the baseline threshold indicative of a heightened influenza situation. The surge was particularly pronounced in the youngest (0-4 years) and school-age (5-24 years) populations, suggesting increased transmission in these demographics which often act as vectors for the spread of respiratory illnesses. Despite a recent decline in the overall ratio of ILI patients, the percentage remained above the baseline for several weeks, signaling a sustained period of elevated influenza activity. The consistent rise in ILI cases across multiple age brackets could strain healthcare resources, necessitating preparedness in managing increased outpatient visits, potential hospitalizations, and the need for influenza prevention measures. The data suggests a waning trend in the latest weeks; however, vigilance is still required as ILI activity remains above the threshold of normal seasonal variability.
