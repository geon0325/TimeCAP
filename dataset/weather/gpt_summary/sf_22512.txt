Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have shown a generally decreasing trend, transitioning from warmer conditions earlier in the day to cooler temperatures by nightfall, which is typical for the region's microclimate. Humidity levels have experienced fluctuations, with a notable increase during the night that reached a point of complete saturation, suggesting the possibility of fog formation, especially in coastal and low-lying areas. Atmospheric pressure has remained relatively stable, with a slight increase toward the end of the period, indicating steady weather conditions without the immediate approach of a significant weather system. Wind speeds have been consistently light throughout the day, contributing to calm weather conditions, with the wind direction gradually shifting from a northwesterly to a more westerly flow, which is common for the local sea breeze influence. These conditions combined are indicative of typical San Francisco weather, with no immediate signs of severe weather disturbances or significant changes in the near-term forecast.
