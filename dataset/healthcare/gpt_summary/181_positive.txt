Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable decrease in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with rates dropping from a high of 19.30% to 2.05%. The number of specimens tested has also decreased over this period, starting at 42,842 and falling to 8,080 in the most recent week. Influenza A has consistently been the predominant strain, although its incidence has significantly decreased from a peak rate of 17.91% to just 0.98%. Meanwhile, positive specimens for Influenza B have shown less fluctuation, with the percentage of positive specimens hovering around 1.40-1.79% for the majority of the time, indicating a relatively stable but persistent presence. The overall declining trend in positive influenza specimens suggests a diminishing wave of infections, which may lead to reduced healthcare burden related to influenza; however, continued surveillance is necessary to monitor for potential trends of resurgence or the emergence of new strains.
