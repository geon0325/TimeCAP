Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have experienced minor fluctuations, indicating stable weather conditions with a slight cooling trend towards the end of the observed period. Relative humidity levels have remained high throughout, suggesting a moist air mass in the region which could lead to a perception of chilliness despite moderate temperatures. Air pressure has been very stable and gradually increasing, which is typically associated with settled weather and is likely to continue to inhibit the development of any significant weather systems. Wind speeds have been consistently light, indicating a calm atmosphere with limited wind chill effect and minimal impact on sea conditions. The wind direction has shifted from northeasterly to northwesterly throughout the day, which could influence coastal fog patterns and potentially bring cooler ocean air inland.
