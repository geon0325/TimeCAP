Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a moderate fluctuation in temperature, with a general trend toward warming. Humidity levels have seen a notable decrease from the earlier high values, suggesting a decrease in moisture in the air. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight decline observed more recently, which could indicate an approaching change in weather patterns. Wind speeds have been mostly light to moderate, with a recent increase, while wind direction has been predominantly from the south, shifting to a more southerly direction towards the end of the period. These conditions, particularly the combination of increasing temperature, decreasing humidity, and stable pressure, are indicative of fair weather with no immediate signs of precipitation.
