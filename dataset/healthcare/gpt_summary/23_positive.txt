Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable decline in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a drop from 19.97% in week 1 to 0.78% in week 20. The reduction is observed in both Influenza A and B, with Influenza A showing a more significant decrease from 14.74% to 0.35%, while Influenza B went from 5.23% to 0.43%. Despite the overall decline, the ratio of Influenza B specimens remained relatively stable compared to Influenza A, suggesting that Influenza B has a more consistent presence among the positive specimens. The highest ratio of positive specimens occurred early in the time series, peaking within the first five weeks, which could indicate a typical seasonal pattern of influenza incidence. The declining trend in positive influenza specimens could ease the burden on healthcare resources, potentially allowing for reallocation to other pressing health issues, but continued surveillance is necessary to monitor for potential resurgences.
