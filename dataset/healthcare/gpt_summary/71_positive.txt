Over the last 20 weeks, the data shows a significant decrease in both the number of specimens tested for influenza and the proportion of positive cases. Initially, there was a high prevalence of Influenza A, with its positive ratio peaking at 19.34% and gradually declining to 1.25%, indicating a substantial reduction in Influenza A activity. In contrast, Influenza B showed a later peak and a slower decline, suggesting a different epidemiological pattern; however, its positive ratio also decreased to 1.28%. The overall ratio of positive influenza specimens has dropped from a peak of 24.73% to a low of 2.53%, suggesting a significant decline in influenza transmission or a reduction in the population seeking testing. These trends are critical for healthcare resource allocation and could indicate a transition out of the peak influenza season, but continuous monitoring is necessary to manage potential future outbreaks.
