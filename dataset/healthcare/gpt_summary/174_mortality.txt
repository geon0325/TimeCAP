Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a general decrease in the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, with a peak of 11.80% in the first week and declining to 8.01% in the final week, which is slightly above the average ratio of 7.84%. The total number of deaths started at 66,709 and saw fluctuations, ending slightly lower at 59,638 in the 20th week. The number of deaths from pneumonia showed a decreasing trend from 7,825 to 4,772, aligning with the overall decline in the mortality ratio. Influenza deaths remained low throughout the period, with a minor peak at the beginning (48 deaths) and ending even lower at 5 deaths in the last week. The downward trend in mortality from these respiratory conditions could indicate an improvement in public health measures or seasonal variations, but it remains a significant concern for healthcare systems due to the substantial proportion of total mortality they represent.
