Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant fluctuation in the ratio of positive influenza specimens, reaching a peak between weeks 13 and 15 with ratios exceeding 30%. The number of specimens tested has generally increased over the period, with a notable rise in weeks 7 through 20, suggesting heightened surveillance or an increase in respiratory illnesses prompting testing. Influenza A has consistently been more prevalent than Influenza B, although both subtypes showed a sharp increase in positive cases around the midpoint of the timeframe, followed by a decline towards the end. The latest data indicates a substantial decrease in positive cases for both subtypes, with the overall positivity ratio dropping to 7.50%, which is closer to the 20-week average of 6.26%. This trend suggests that the peak of the influenza season may have passed, but continued monitoring is essential to manage and allocate healthcare resources effectively.
