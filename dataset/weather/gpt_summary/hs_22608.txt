Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching a peak in the latter part of the day before slightly cooling. Relative humidity showed a decreasing trend as temperatures rose, which is consistent with the diurnal pattern of lower humidity during the warmer parts of the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with a slight decrease towards the end of the 24-hour window, which could indicate a minor change in the weather system. Wind speeds were generally low, but there was a marginal increase towards the end of the period. The wind direction was predominantly from the south to southwest, which is typical for this region and can contribute to the transport of moisture and warmth, possibly affecting the local weather conditions.
