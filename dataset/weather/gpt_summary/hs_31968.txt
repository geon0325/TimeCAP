Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have shown a slight decline during the night, followed by a gradual increase through the day, typical of the diurnal pattern in a subtropical climate. Relative humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, indicative of cooler nighttime temperatures leading to condensation and a more saturated atmosphere. Air pressure has been on a gradual decrease, which could suggest a developing low-pressure system that might lead to unstable weather conditions or increased chances of precipitation. Wind speeds varied moderately with occasional gusts; however, they remained within a range that would not typically cause concern for severe weather events. The wind direction has been predominantly from the south to southeast, which is common for Houston and often brings in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, potentially contributing to the elevated humidity levels experienced.
