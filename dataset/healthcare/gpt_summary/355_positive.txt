Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant upward trend in the ratio of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the overall positivity rate growing from 0.52% to 26.27%, an increase that far exceeds the 20-week average of 6.26%. The number of specimens tested has also risen, peaking in week 19, suggesting increased surveillance or potentially higher rates of respiratory illness. Influenza A has been the predominant strain throughout the period, with its positivity rate increasing from 0.46% to 26.15%, while Influenza B has remained a smaller proportion of the positive specimens, and its positivity rate has shown less fluctuation, ending at 0.11%. The steep rise in the ratio of positive specimens, particularly for Influenza A, indicates a substantial influenza activity, which could strain healthcare resources due to increased hospital admissions and outpatient visits. The data suggests the need for heightened public health interventions, including vaccination and antiviral treatment strategies, to manage the surge in influenza cases.
