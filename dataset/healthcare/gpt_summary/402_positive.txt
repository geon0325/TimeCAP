Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable upward trend in the ratio of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a marked increase from 0.95% in week 1 to 2.62% in week 20. This trend is observed for both Influenza A and Influenza B, although the increase in positive specimens for Influenza A is more pronounced, rising from 0.58% to 1.89%, compared to Influenza B which increased from 0.37% to 0.73%. The total number of specimens tested has also progressively risen, with the highest number of tests conducted in week 20 (77,193), which could partly explain the increased detection rates. The peak in positive Influenza A cases in the last week suggests a surge that may strain healthcare resources if it continues to rise. The overall increase in influenza positivity indicates a potential escalation of influenza activity, warranting public health interventions to mitigate spread and healthcare planning to manage increasing patient loads.
