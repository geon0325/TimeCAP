Over the last 20 weeks, the data exhibits a gradual increase in the percentage of patients presenting with Influenza-like Illness (ILI), with recent weeks surpassing the baseline threshold, which signals a noteworthy uptick in ILI cases. The age group of 5-24 years has shown a particularly significant rise in ILI cases, which could suggest higher transmission rates in schools or among young adults. Adults aged 25-49 and the elderly population (65 years or older) also show increasing trends, indicating that ILI is affecting a broad demographic. The consistent growth in ILI percentages across all age groups in recent weeks may place an increasing demand on healthcare resources, potentially leading to strained services and the need for enhanced surveillance and prevention measures. Given the upward trend in ILI activity, public health initiatives may need to focus on vaccination, awareness campaigns, and preparedness planning to mitigate the impact on the healthcare system.
