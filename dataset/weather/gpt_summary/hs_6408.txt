Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature exhibited a typical diurnal pattern with the warmest conditions occurring in the afternoon and cooler temperatures during the early morning hours. Humidity levels were inversely correlated with temperature changes, peaking during the cooler early morning and decreasing as temperatures rose, indicative of the substantial moisture content in the air. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with a slight decreasing trend towards the end of the day, which could suggest the potential for changing weather conditions. Wind speeds fluctuated mildly with no significant gusts, maintaining a light to gentle breeze, while wind direction varied, showing predominantly southerly winds that shifted to a more westerly direction in the afternoon and evening. The combination of warm temperatures, relatively high humidity, and stable air pressure with light variable winds indicates a typical pattern for Houston, though the slight pressure decrease may need to be monitored for any upcoming changes in the weather.
