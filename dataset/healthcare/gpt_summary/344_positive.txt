Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a fluctuating but overall decreasing trend in the ratio of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a significant drop from a peak of 7.27% in week 1 to a low of 0.48% by week 14. The prevalence of Influenza A has consistently been higher than Influenza B, with its positivity rate decreasing from 7.20% to 0.42% over the same period, while Influenza B remained under 0.10% throughout. However, in the last six weeks, there is a noticeable uptick in the ratio of positive specimens for both Influenza A and B, culminating in a combined increase to 1.25% in the most recent week, hinting at a potential resurgence. This observed trend of rising influenza cases could signal the beginning of a new wave, necessitating vigilance and potential adjustments in healthcare resource allocation to manage increased patient load. The average positivity rate of 6.26% over the 20 weeks suggests that influenza remains a significant concern, and continued monitoring is essential for early detection of trends and effective public health response.
