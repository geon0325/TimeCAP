Over the past 24 hours in New York City, temperatures have experienced a gradual decrease during the night, followed by a notable increase throughout the day, indicating a typical diurnal pattern. Humidity levels have shown significant variation, with a marked increase during the early morning hours, likely due to cooler temperatures leading to condensation, and then decreasing noticeably as temperatures rose. Air pressure remained relatively high and stable, suggesting the continuation of fair weather conditions. Wind speeds have generally been moderate but decreased significantly towards the middle of the period, which could have led to a decrease in wind chill effect and more comfortable conditions. The wind direction was predominantly from the north, shifting to the south in the late hours, which may bring a change in temperature and moisture levels in the upcoming hours.
