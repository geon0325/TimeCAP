Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable fluctuation in temperature, with a peak during the late afternoon hours and a significant drop towards the early morning, indicative of typical diurnal variation exacerbated by local weather conditions. Humidity levels varied considerably, reaching near-saturation in the early morning hours, which, coupled with the lowest temperatures of the day, may have led to the formation of morning fog, a common occurrence in this region. Air pressure showed a downward trend with a few spikes, suggesting the passage of different air masses over the area which could have influenced the wind patterns and temperature changes observed. Wind speeds remained mostly light but picked up significantly towards the end of the 24-hour period, potentially bringing changes in weather conditions such as increased cloud cover or a shift in temperatures. The wind direction was predominantly from the west-southwest, which is typical for coastal San Francisco, influenced by sea breezes and the city's general maritime climate.
