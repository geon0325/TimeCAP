Over the last 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have experienced a gradual increase during the day, reaching their peak in the late afternoon before cooling slightly at night. Relative humidity levels have shown a marked decrease through the afternoon hours, coinciding with the peak in temperatures, and then fluctuated, indicating variable moisture in the air. Air pressure remained relatively stable with only slight variations, suggesting stable weather conditions without significant frontal changes. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a temporary lull in the early morning hours, followed by a steady increase towards the evening, possibly affecting the dispersal of air pollutants and providing some relief from the heat. The wind direction varied, mostly coming from the south to southeast, which is typical for Houston and can contribute to bringing in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico.
