Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the mortality attributed to Influenza or Pneumonia as a percentage of total deaths, with a significant peak occurring mid-period. The ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia to total deaths started below the 20-week average at 6.50%, rose to a high of 10.89% in the eighth week, and then showed a general declining trend to end at 6.89% in the twentieth week. The number of deaths from Influenza spiked in the sixth week, which coincided with a dramatic increase in overall deaths, suggesting a potential outbreak or seasonal surge. Pneumonia deaths also peaked during this period but have since shown a gradual decrease, aligning with the drop in the mortality ratio. These fluctuations could indicate the impact of seasonal patterns on respiratory illnesses and highlight the need for ongoing healthcare preparedness and response planning, particularly in managing hospital capacity and resources during peak times of respiratory disease activity.
