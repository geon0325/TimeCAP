Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable decline in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the ratio dropping from 23.65% to 0.85%. This trend indicates a significant decrease in influenza activity across the monitored period. Influenza A has shown a more pronounced decrease compared to Influenza B, with its positive specimen ratio declining from 18.16% to 0.41%. Despite the overall decline, Influenza B has maintained a steadier presence, with its ratio decreasing less sharply from 5.49% to 0.44%. The reduction in influenza cases may alleviate some strain on healthcare resources, but continued surveillance is necessary to monitor for potential resurgences or the emergence of new viral strains.
