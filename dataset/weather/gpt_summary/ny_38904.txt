Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature followed by a slight increase, indicating a typical diurnal variation where the coolest temperatures occurred during the early morning hours. Humidity levels were initially high but showed significant fluctuations throughout the period, possibly affecting the subjective feel of the air temperature and comfort levels outside. Atmospheric pressure has been steadily increasing, suggesting the presence or development of a high-pressure system which is generally associated with stable and clearer weather conditions. Wind speeds varied, with several instances of higher gusts, which could have amplified the chill factor, especially when temperatures were at their lowest. The wind direction was predominantly from the north-west, with occasional shifts, which is typical for this time of year in New York City and may have contributed to the cooler temperatures observed.
