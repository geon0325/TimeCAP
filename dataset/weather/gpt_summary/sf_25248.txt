Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have exhibited a diurnal pattern, decreasing during the early hours and rising towards the afternoon, which is typical for the region's climate. Humidity levels have shown moderate fluctuations but have mostly remained stable, suggesting a relatively consistent amount of moisture in the air, which could contribute to the feeling of coolness despite warmer temperatures. Air pressure has been relatively steady with a slight decrease in the last few hours, possibly indicating a weak weather system approaching or moving away from the area. Wind speeds have varied, with some hours experiencing calm conditions and others witnessing breezier conditions; such variability in wind speed can lead to sudden changes in temperature perception. The wind direction has been predominantly westerly, which is characteristic of the coastal sea breezes influencing San Francisco's weather, potentially bringing in cooler marine air from the ocean.
