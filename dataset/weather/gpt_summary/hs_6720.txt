Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, culminating in notably higher temperatures towards the end of the period. Humidity levels showed a slight decline, particularly in the latter half of the time frame, which could indicate drier conditions moving into the area. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with a minor increase followed by a slight decrease, suggesting stable weather conditions without significant changes in weather patterns. Wind speeds were consistent and light, not indicating any significant weather fronts moving through. The wind direction varied but predominantly came from the south to southeast, which is typical for Houston and can contribute to the increase in temperature due to warmer air being brought in from those directions.
