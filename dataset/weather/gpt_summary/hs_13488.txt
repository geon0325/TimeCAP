Over the last 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have shown a gradual increase during the day with a peak in the afternoon before cooling slightly towards the evening. Humidity levels started moderately but increased significantly, indicating a more muggy environment, which is typical for the region, and then slightly decreased later in the day. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase towards the middle of the day, suggesting stable weather conditions without significant fronts or storms. Wind speed varied, with some calm periods; however, there were instances of increased wind activity, particularly in the afternoon, which could have offered a reprieve from the humidity. The wind direction was primarily from the southeast to east, consistent with onshore flows that can bring moisture and warmth from the Gulf of Mexico to the area.
