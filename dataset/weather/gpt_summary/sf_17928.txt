Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures displayed a typical diurnal cycle with a peak during the day followed by a gradual decrease towards the early morning hours, before warming up again. Humidity levels were inversely correlated with temperature changes, increasing as temperatures fell, and reaching their highest values overnight which suggests a possibility of morning fog or dew. Atmospheric pressure remained remarkably stable, indicating a period of settled weather without significant fronts or storms passing through the area. Wind speeds were light throughout the day, with calm conditions prevalent during the nighttime hours, which could have contributed to the higher humidity levels by reducing dispersal of moisture. The wind direction was predominantly from the west to northwest, which is common for San Francisco due to its coastal location and the influence of the Pacific Ocean.
