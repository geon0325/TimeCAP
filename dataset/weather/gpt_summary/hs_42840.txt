Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have demonstrated a typical diurnal pattern, with the highest values observed during the late afternoon and a gradual cooling through the night into the early morning hours. Relative humidity levels have fluctuated significantly, reaching saturation during the night, which may have resulted in foggy conditions or dew. Air pressure has shown a slight decreasing trend, indicating the possibility of changing weather patterns or the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds have been mostly light and variable, with a notable shift in wind direction from southeasterly to northerly and then veering towards easterly and southerly again, suggesting the passage of a frontal system or local breeze effects. The combination of high temperatures and varying humidity levels could have led to periods of discomfort, while the changing wind patterns and air pressure might signal a transition to different weather conditions in the near future.
