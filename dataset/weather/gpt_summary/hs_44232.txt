Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a notable diurnal temperature variation, with temperatures peaking during the afternoon hours and decreasing toward the early morning, indicative of typical patterns in the region. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, reaching their highest point early in the morning, which is common due to overnight cooling and potential dew formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with only minor fluctuations, suggesting a period of steady weather conditions. Wind speeds varied, with calm winds during the night transitioning to moderate speeds during the day, which could contribute to dispelling any early morning fog or mist. The wind direction was predominantly from the south-southeast, shifting occasionally, which is typical for Houston and may influence moisture levels and precipitation chances in the area.
