Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, culminating in a high that is noticeably warmer than the initial recorded temperature. Humidity levels showed a slight fluctuation but generally trended downwards as the temperature rose, which is typical as warmer air can hold more moisture. Air pressure remained relatively steady throughout the day, with a slight decrease noted towards the end of the period, which could indicate an approaching change in weather conditions. Wind speeds varied, beginning with stronger winds that eased into calmer conditions during the middle of the period, before increasing again towards the end. Wind direction was predominantly westerly with some variation, which is consistent with the city's usual wind patterns coming off the Pacific Ocean.
