Over the last 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual rise in temperature, culminating in a peak during the latter part of the period, followed by a slight drop. Humidity levels have seen an overall decrease throughout the day, with a notable dip coinciding with the highest temperatures, suggesting an inverse relationship between temperature and humidity at this time. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight increase towards the middle of the period, which could indicate more settled weather conditions. Wind speeds varied, with a significant increase during the period of peak temperature, potentially contributing to the lower humidity levels observed.
