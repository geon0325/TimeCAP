Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable increase in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a significant rise observed in both Influenza A and B. The data demonstrates a steady growth in the number of positive specimens, with the percentage of positive tests for Influenza A and B jumping from 0.72% and 0.22% in week 1 to 13.89% and 2.85% by week 20, respectively. Influenza A has shown a more pronounced increase, reaching a peak positivity ratio of 14.99% in week 18, compared to the highest Influenza B ratio of 3.28% in the same week. The overall ratio of positive specimens peaked at 18.27% in week 18, significantly higher than the 20-week average of 6.26%. This upward trend indicates a surge in influenza activity, which requires increased healthcare resources and could lead to heightened pressure on healthcare systems, emphasizing the need for proactive measures such as vaccination and early antiviral treatment.
