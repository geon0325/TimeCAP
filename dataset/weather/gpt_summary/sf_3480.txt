Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures exhibited a gradual decline through the night, reaching their lowest just before sunrise, then increased during the day, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels were inversely correlated with temperature changes, peaking during the cooler early morning hours and decreasing as temperatures rose, suggesting a pattern where warmer air holds less relative moisture. Air pressure remained relatively stable with only minor fluctuations, maintaining conditions that did not signal any significant weather fronts or storms. Wind speeds varied throughout the day, with several instances of higher gusts, especially towards the latter part of the observation period, which could influence wind chill and make conditions feel cooler than the actual temperature. Predominantly westerly wind directions were recorded, consistent with San Francisco's usual weather patterns driven by marine influences from the Pacific Ocean.
