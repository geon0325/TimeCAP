Over the last 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have seen a gradual increase, indicating a warming trend. Humidity levels have been relatively high, frequently reaching peak values, which could suggest a muggy atmosphere and the potential for precipitation. Air pressure has shown a slight decrease in the later hours, which might be indicative of an approaching weather system that could lead to changes in the current conditions. Wind speeds have been mostly moderate but did show some fluctuations, while wind direction has been predominantly from the south, suggesting a consistent flow of warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. These factors combined suggest that Houston may experience increased cloudiness or potential rain events if the trends continue.
