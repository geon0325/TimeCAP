Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature reaching its peak in the late afternoon, followed by a slight cooling trend towards the evening. Humidity levels started moderately high and increased overnight, which could have led to a muggy feeling in the early hours, before decreasing significantly as the temperature rose throughout the day. Atmospheric pressure showed minor fluctuations but overall displayed a slight downward trend, which might suggest a potential change in weather patterns or the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds remained relatively steady and moderate, with no significant gusts that would impact the local weather. The wind direction shifted from southerly to westerly during the day, and then turned to a northwesterly direction in the late hours, which could influence the transport of air masses and potentially bring cooler and drier conditions to the area.
