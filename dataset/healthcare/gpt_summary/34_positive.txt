Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a fluctuating trend in the number of respiratory specimens testing positive for Influenza A and B, with a total average positivity ratio of 6.26%, which is higher than the peak weekly ratio of 3.06%. Despite an overall increase in the number of specimens tested, reaching a peak at week 20, the percentage of positive cases has remained below the average, indicating a lower prevalence or improved detection compared to the average. Influenza B has consistently shown higher positivity rates compared to Influenza A, with its peak positivity at week 1 (2.26%) and maintaining a higher ratio in subsequent weeks. However, there is a notable peak in Influenza A positivity at week 14 (1.10%), suggesting a potential surge or shift in the dominant influenza strain. The decreasing trend in the ratio of positive specimens in the most recent weeks, despite increased testing, may indicate a possible waning of the influenza season or effectiveness of public health interventions.
