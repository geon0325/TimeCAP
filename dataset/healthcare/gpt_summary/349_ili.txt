Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a fluctuating but generally increasing trend in the percentage of patients with Influenza-like Illness (ILI), surpassing the baseline level in recent weeks before a decline in the latest data point. The age group of 25-49 showed a notable surge in ILI cases, with the highest increase among the monitored age brackets, suggesting a significant impact on the working-age population. This was followed by a sharp rise in ILI incidence among children aged 0-4 and 5-24, which could have implications for pediatric healthcare services and educational institutions. The elderly population (65 or more) maintained lower ILI counts compared to other age groups, but any increase in this demographic is concerning due to their vulnerability to complications. The peak in ILI ratio above the baseline highlights a period of increased healthcare demand, with potential stress on healthcare resources and a need for heightened public health measures to manage the spread of influenza.
