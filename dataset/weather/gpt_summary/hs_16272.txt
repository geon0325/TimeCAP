Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before showing a slight decrease into the night. Humidity levels started moderately high and increased overnight, which could have led to muggy conditions, but there was a notable decrease during the latter part of the day, suggesting drier air moving into the area. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with only minor fluctuations, indicating a steady weather pattern without the immediate likelihood of significant weather disturbances. Wind speeds were consistently light to gentle, with minimal variation, which would not have contributed to any significant wind chill effect or dispersion of pollutants. The wind direction shifted from southeasterly to southwesterly and then to a more northerly direction by the end of the period, which could be indicative of a frontal passage or changing weather systems impacting Houston.
