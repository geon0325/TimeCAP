Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant upward trend in both the number of respiratory specimens tested for influenza and the percentage of positive cases. Specifically, the ratio of positive specimens has more than doubled from the average of 6.26%, reaching 15.54% in the most recent week. Influenza A has shown a more pronounced increase in positivity rate compared to Influenza B, with the latest figures at 11.52% and 4.01%, respectively. This surge in influenza cases, particularly the sharp rise in Influenza A, suggests a growing burden on healthcare resources that may require increased attention to flu prevention and treatment measures. The data indicates a pressing need for healthcare systems to prepare for continued high demand for diagnostic testing, vaccination, and potential hospitalization as the flu season progresses.
