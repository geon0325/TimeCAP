Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have shown a slight fluctuation, with a general cooling trend during the night followed by a moderate increase as the day progressed. Humidity levels were relatively high throughout the period, which suggests a potential for fog development, especially during the early morning hours when humidity peaked. Air pressure remained fairly consistent, indicating a period of stable weather conditions without the immediate likelihood of significant weather changes such as storms. Wind speeds were light and variable, which would not contribute to significant wind chill effects or dispersion of fog and low clouds. Wind direction varied, with a general tendency toward westerly and southwesterly directions, which is typical for coastal areas influenced by sea breezes.
