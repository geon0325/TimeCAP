Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have exhibited a modest diurnal variation, with a noticeable decrease during the early morning hours before rising again towards the afternoon. Humidity levels have shown significant fluctuations, maintaining high values initially, then dramatically dropping in the afternoon, which could be indicative of a frontal passage or dry air moving into the area. Air pressure experienced a gradual decline throughout the period, suggesting a possible change in the weather pattern or the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds remained relatively calm, with a slight increase observed in the late afternoon, which may affect the dispersion of pollutants and provide some relief from the heat. Wind direction was predominantly steady with occasional shifts, including a notable deviation in the early morning, which could align with the transient changes in humidity and pressure observed.
