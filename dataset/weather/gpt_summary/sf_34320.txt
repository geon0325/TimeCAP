Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature, with a trend of cooling overnight before warming up significantly towards the late afternoon. Humidity levels have shown moderate variability, with higher levels during the cooler early hours and decreasing as the temperature peaked later in the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout most of the period but exhibited a significant spike, suggesting the possible influence of a transient high-pressure system. Wind conditions have been variable, both in speed and direction, with a general pattern of stronger winds earlier in the period that weakened towards the middle of the day before increasing slightly again towards the end of the observation period. The wind predominantly came from a westerly direction, which is typical for coastal San Francisco and can have a cooling effect on the local climate.
