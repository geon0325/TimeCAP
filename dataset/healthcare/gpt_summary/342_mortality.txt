Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a discernible upward trend in the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, starting from 5.12% and rising to 8.97%, surpassing the average ratio of 7.84%. This increase coincides with a growth in the absolute number of deaths attributed to these illnesses, with deaths from influenza alone escalating notably from 12 to 1028 and pneumonia from 2836 to 4979. The total number of deaths has also increased, from 55632 to 67000, indicating a broader rise in mortality. The peak in influenza mortality in the most recent weeks is especially concerning and could suggest a more virulent strain or reduced population immunity. These trends might signal the need for heightened public health interventions, vaccination campaigns, and healthcare resource allocation to manage the rising impact of respiratory infections on mortality.
