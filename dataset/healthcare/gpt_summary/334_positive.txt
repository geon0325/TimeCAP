Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a general decreasing trend in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the peak positivity rate of 9.89% in week 7 dropping to 0.79% by week 20. Influenza A has been the dominant strain, with its highest positivity rate at 9.85% in week 7, but it has since decreased significantly to 0.71% in week 20. Despite a much lower incidence, Influenza B's positivity rate remained relatively stable, with minor fluctuations and a slight increase to 0.08% in week 20 from a low of 0.04% in week 7. The total number of specimens tested remained high throughout the period, with a peak at week 11 (84708 tests), indicating sustained vigilance in surveillance efforts. The observed decline in influenza positivity rates suggests a downward trend in influenza activity, which may lead to a decreased burden on healthcare resources; however, continued monitoring is necessary to detect any potential resurgence.
