Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, which is typical as the day transitions into night. During the same period, humidity levels saw an increasing trend, which could have resulted in a feeling of increased mugginess, potentially causing discomfort for residents. Air pressure remained relatively stable and high, suggesting a period of settled weather without significant disturbances. Wind speeds were consistent and moderate, indicating steady weather conditions without any abrupt changes. Wind direction varied slightly but mainly came from the southeast, which is common for Houston and could contribute to the transport of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, possibly affecting humidity levels.
