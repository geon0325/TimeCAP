Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have exhibited a diurnal pattern, with a notable increase during the daytime, followed by a decrease at night, indicative of typical coastal climate behavior. Humidity levels have fluctuated significantly, dropping sharply at one point, which could suggest the influence of localized atmospheric conditions or the passage of a dry air mass over the region. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight uptick, but experienced a substantial drop and subsequent recovery, signaling a transient weather event that could have been associated with a frontal system passing through the area. Wind speeds were generally moderate but displayed a sharp increase towards the end of the period, which could lead to choppy conditions on the bay and increased wind chill factors for residents and visitors outdoors. The predominant wind direction was westerly, with some variability, which is consistent with the prevailing winds off the Pacific Ocean that influence San Francisco's climate.
