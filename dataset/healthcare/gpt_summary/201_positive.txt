Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a marked increase in the incidence of influenza, with the total ratio of specimens testing positive for influenza rising from 2.08% to 26.93%. This upward trend is particularly notable in the last five weeks, where the percentage of positive specimens more than doubled from 11.66% to 26.93%, indicating a rapid spread of the virus. Influenza B has shown a more pronounced increase in prevalence compared to Influenza A, with its ratio of positive specimens rising from 1.14% to 17.59%, compared to Influenza A's increase from 0.94% to 9.34%. The week-over-week growth in positive specimens for both Influenza A and B suggests a significant impact on the healthcare system, with the potential for increased hospitalizations, a greater burden on testing facilities, and a need for enhanced public health measures. The healthcare system may need to allocate more resources to manage the growing number of influenza cases, including vaccination drives, antiviral treatments, and public awareness campaigns to mitigate the spread.
