Humidity levels fluctuated but remained high for most of the period, suggesting the potential for muggy conditions. Atmospheric pressure showed a gradual increase, which typically indicates steady weather and could lead to clearer skies. Winds were generally light to moderate, with a significant increase in wind speed, which might have contributed to a brisk feel for pedestrians.
