Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable increase in the mortality ratio of deaths from influenza and pneumonia compared to total deaths, rising from 16.00% to a peak of 18.51% before slightly decreasing to 16.88%. This trend significantly exceeds the average ratio of 7.84%, indicating a severe impact of these respiratory conditions on the overall mortality. The total number of deaths fluctuated, peaking in week 15 at 86,858, while the absolute number of deaths from pneumonia showed a sharp increase until week 16, followed by a decline. Notably, deaths from influenza spiked dramatically in week 17, with 187 deaths, which is a substantial rise from the previous weeks' figures, before decreasing again, but still remaining higher than the initial weeks. These trends suggest a heightened burden on healthcare resources due to respiratory illnesses and could indicate a potential outbreak or increased virulence of influenza and/or pneumonia during this period.
