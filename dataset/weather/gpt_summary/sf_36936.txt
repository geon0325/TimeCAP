Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a moderate fluctuation in temperature with a general increase observed after a cooler period, reaching a peak in the final hours. Humidity levels varied significantly, with notably high humidity at times, which could have resulted in foggy conditions, especially when the temperatures were at their lowest. Air pressure remained relatively stable, albeit with a slight increase during the cooler period, suggesting a transient high-pressure system influence. Wind speeds were mostly gentle but showed an increase towards the end of the period, which might have contributed to a dispersal of any fog or low cloud cover.
