Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced remarkably stable weather conditions, with no fluctuations in temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed, or wind direction. The temperature has been consistently high, which is atypical for the city's usual climate and could suggest an ongoing heatwave or an error in data collection. Relative humidity has remained low, which, when combined with the high temperatures, could increase the risk of dehydration and heat-related illnesses for the population. Atmospheric pressure has been stable at a level that is considered average for sea-level conditions, indicating no immediate change in weather patterns such as the onset of a storm. The wind has been gentle and steady from the same direction, suggesting a calm weather pattern without significant turbulence or changes in weather fronts.
