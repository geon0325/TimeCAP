Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a fluctuation in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the combined percentage for both Influenza A and B peaking at 0.29% in week 6 and declining to 0.08% in week 20. The average positivity rate of 6.26% suggests an overall low level of influenza circulation. Influenza B has been more prevalent than Influenza A throughout the period, with its highest positivity at 0.21% in week 9, though both types have seen a decreasing trend in recent weeks. The decrease in positive specimens, particularly in the latter weeks, could indicate a waning influenza season or effective public health interventions. However, healthcare systems should remain vigilant as low-level circulation does not eliminate the potential for future outbreaks.
