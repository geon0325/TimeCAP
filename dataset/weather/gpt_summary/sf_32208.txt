Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperature showed a diurnal pattern with a peak during the afternoon hours and a gradual decrease towards the early morning. Humidity levels remained relatively high throughout the day, suggesting a presence of moisture in the air, which could lead to a sense of mugginess or potential fog development, especially during the cooler night and morning hours. Air pressure exhibited minor fluctuations but remained within a narrow range, indicating stable atmospheric conditions with no significant weather fronts passing through. Wind speeds varied but were mostly gentle to moderate, with a notable increase during the evening, which could have dispersed any early fog or low-level cloud cover. The wind direction predominantly shifted from northerly in the early hours to westerly and northwesterly, consistent with the region's typical wind patterns driven by the Pacific Ocean's influence.
