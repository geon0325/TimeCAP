Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature from its peak during the daytime, which is typical as the city transitions from day to night. The humidity levels followed an inverse pattern, peaking during the cooler nighttime hours, which could have contributed to a muggy feel for residents overnight and into the early morning. Air pressure showed a slow decreasing trend, which might suggest an approaching weather system that could lead to changes in weather conditions in the near future. Wind speeds remained predominantly light, and there was no significant pattern, indicating calm weather conditions. The wind direction was variable throughout the period, with occasional shifts, but without a consistent pattern to suggest any dominant weather influence from a particular direction.
