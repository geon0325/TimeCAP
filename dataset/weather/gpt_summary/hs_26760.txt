Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has exhibited a gradual increasing trend, indicating a warming pattern that peaked towards the latter part of the observed period. Humidity levels started high but experienced a significant decrease mid-period, which aligns with the increase in temperature, before rising again towards the end of the period, potentially contributing to a muggy feel in the air. Air pressure showed a slight decreasing trend throughout the day, which could be indicative of an approaching weather system or front. Wind speeds were variable but generally moderate, with some hours experiencing higher gusts, which may have provided some relief from the higher temperatures. The wind direction was predominantly from the southeast, which is typical for Houston and can bring moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, potentially affecting local weather conditions with increased humidity and chances of precipitation.
