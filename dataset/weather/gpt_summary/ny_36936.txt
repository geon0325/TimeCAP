Humidity levels varied widely, reaching saturation at one point, which may have led to fog or mist, but generally stayed moderate, suggesting a relatively dry air mass over the city. Air pressure consistently increased throughout the period, pointing to the likely presence of a high-pressure system, which is often associated with clear skies and calmer weather.
