Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a slight fluctuation in temperature with a general cooling trend until the late afternoon, after which temperatures rose again. Humidity levels were high throughout the period, peaking during the early morning hours, which is typical for coastal cities and could potentially lead to morning fog conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable, indicating a period of steady weather without significant fronts or storms passing through the area. Wind speeds were consistently light, suggesting a calm weather pattern with little to no wind chill effect. The wind direction varied mainly within the west to the northwest quadrant, which is common for the region and could contribute to the transport of marine air inland, affecting local temperatures and fog development.
