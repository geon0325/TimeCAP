Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in the mortality rates from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to total deaths, with a peak ratio of 10.89% in Week 6, significantly above the average ratio of 7.84%. The total number of deaths reached its highest point in Week 5 with 66,134 deaths, coinciding with a sharp increase in deaths attributed to Influenza, which spiked at 1,165 in the same week. Although the number of deaths from Pneumonia remained consistently higher than those from Influenza, both causes saw a general decline in absolute numbers over the period, with Pneumonia deaths decreasing from 5,156 in Week 5 to 3,430 in Week 20. The ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia to total deaths decreased towards the end of the 20-week period, aligning more closely with the average ratio. This trend may suggest a relative improvement in the control or treatment of these conditions, yet the healthcare system should remain vigilant, especially considering the historical impact of seasonal variations on respiratory illnesses.
