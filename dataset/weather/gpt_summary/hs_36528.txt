Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have experienced a gradual increase, reaching a peak in the late afternoon before descending slightly during the evening. Humidity levels have varied significantly, with notable increases during the early morning hours, indicative of potential morning fog or dew. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with a minor fluctuation that is unlikely to have a pronounced impact on weather conditions. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate but showed an increase toward the end of the time series, which could lead to cooler perceived temperatures and increased wind chill. The predominant wind direction has been from the east to southeast, with a temporary shift to the west and then returning to an easterly component, which is typical for this region and may contribute to moisture transport from the Gulf of Mexico.
