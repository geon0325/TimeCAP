Over the last 20 weeks, the data shows that the percentage of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases among the total number of patients has remained below the benchmark level of 2.9%, with the highest recorded ratio being 2.02% in week 3 and a gradual decrease to a low of 1.19% in week 14. Despite the observed fluctuations, the most recent weeks have seen an uptick in ILI cases across all age groups, with the most significant increases in the 0-4 and 5-24 age groups, which could indicate the onset of a seasonal trend or an emerging outbreak. The age 0-4 group showed the most substantial rise in ILI cases, increasing from 5,608 cases in week 13 to 8,980 cases in week 20, suggesting that young children are currently the most affected demographic. The data also reveals a consistent increase in ILI cases for the last six weeks, which could strain healthcare resources if the trend continues and surpasses the 2.9% threshold. Overall, the healthcare system should monitor these trends closely, particularly among younger populations, and be prepared for a potential increase in healthcare demand if the upward trend in ILI cases continues.
