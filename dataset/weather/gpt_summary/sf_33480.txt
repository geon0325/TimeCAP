Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a noticeable decline in temperature during the night, following a peak in the early afternoon, indicating a typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels saw fluctuations throughout the day, with higher values recorded during the night and early morning hours, which is expected given the coastal nature of the city, potentially leading to morning fog. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight decreasing trend, suggesting a stable weather pattern without significant frontal activity. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with some variability in intensity, not indicative of any major wind-related weather events. Wind directions shifted throughout the day, with a tendency for winds to come from the northern quadrant, which could have contributed to the cooler temperatures observed at night.
