Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have demonstrated a typical diurnal pattern, starting high in the early hours, cooling considerably overnight, and then rising again towards the end of the period. Humidity levels remained high for most of the day, indicating a substantial amount of moisture in the air, which could have led to foggy conditions or a sense of mugginess, but there was a significant drop in humidity in the last recorded hour, suggesting a sudden change that could affect comfort levels or visibility. Air pressure was relatively stable for much of the day, with a slight increase mid-period, signifying stable weather conditions; however, a notable pressure drop in the last hour could be indicative of an approaching weather system that may alter conditions. Wind speeds were mostly calm throughout the day, with some increase towards the end of the period, which could contribute to a change in weather patterns or the dispersal of any lingering fog or mist. The wind directions varied, with shifts from westerly to northerly directions, which might be associated with the movement of oceanic air masses onto land, affecting both temperature and humidity levels locally.
