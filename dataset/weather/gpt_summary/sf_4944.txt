Over the past day in San Francisco, temperatures have experienced a modest fluctuation, reflecting a common diurnal pattern with a cooling trend during the early hours and a gradual increase as the day progressed. Humidity levels have seen an overall decrease from their peak in the early morning, which is typical as temperatures rise, but a slight increase was observed late in the period, which could suggest incoming moisture or changing weather fronts. Atmospheric pressure has shown a steady and gradual increase, indicative of a high-pressure system that could lead to stable and clearer weather conditions.
