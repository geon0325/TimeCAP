Humidity levels varied significantly, reaching saturation during the night and dropping sharply during the day, likely contributing to morning fog or dew and clearer conditions by afternoon. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight fluctuation that may have been associated with local weather systems passing through the area. Wind speeds were generally light and variable, with periods of calm conditions especially during the night, but they picked up towards the end of the 24-hour period, suggesting a change in weather patterns. Wind direction shifted throughout the day, with no predominant direction until later in the period when southeasterly winds became more consistent, potentially bringing in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico.
