Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a fluctuating trend in the number of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases across all age groups, with an initial increase followed by variable peaks and troughs. The highest surge in ILI cases was observed in the age group of 25-49, suggesting that adults in this demographic were the most affected. Despite these fluctuations, the ratio of ILI patients remained consistently below the baseline of 2.9%, indicating that the ILI activity has not reached alarming levels. However, the steady rise in ILI cases among the youngest age group (0-4 years) towards the end of the 20-week period could signal a need for closer monitoring and potentially increased healthcare resources for this demographic. The healthcare system may need to prepare for possible increases in demand for medical care if the upward trends in certain age groups continue, although the overall ILI activity is currently below the threshold that typically signifies an epidemic.
