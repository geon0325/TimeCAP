Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable increase in the ratio of mortality due to Influenza or Pneumonia relative to the total number of deaths, starting at 6.48% and peaking at 16.83%, significantly higher than the average ratio of 7.84%. This peak corresponds with a rise in the total number of deaths, which surged from 57,106 to a high of 73,565 before declining. Deaths attributed specifically to Influenza have remained relatively low and stable, whereas deaths from Pneumonia showed a marked increase, reaching a maximum of 12,316 in a single week. The increasing trend in the mortality ratio suggests a growing impact of Pneumonia on overall mortality, potentially indicating seasonal patterns or healthcare system challenges. The recent decrease in the total number of deaths and the mortality ratio from these illnesses may signal an improving situation, but continued monitoring is essential for healthcare planning and response.
