Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable drop in temperature, which indicates a potential cold front passing through the area. Concurrently, humidity levels have shown significant fluctuations, starting high but decreasing notably as the temperature dropped, which is typical after the passage of a front. Air pressure experienced a general increase throughout the period, suggesting the presence of a high-pressure system that is likely to bring more stable weather conditions. Wind speeds were mostly gentle to moderate, with a slight increase during the period of temperature drop, which could be associated with the cold front's movement. Additionally, there was a notable shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly, further supporting the presence of a frontal system moving through the region.
