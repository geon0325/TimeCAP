In the last 24 hours, Houston experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature, displaying a general trend of cooling overnight that transitioned into warming during the day. Humidity levels were relatively high, especially during the cooler overnight and early morning hours, which is typical for the region and can contribute to a muggy feeling. Air pressure saw some variation, with a notable increase around the middle of the period, suggesting the possible influence of a transient high-pressure system that could lead to stable weather conditions. Wind speeds remained mostly light throughout the period, with minimal changes, indicating a lack of significant weather fronts moving through the area. Wind direction varied but predominantly came from the south, which is common for Houston and can contribute to the transport of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, affecting local humidity and precipitation patterns.
