Over the last 24 hours, New York City experienced a gradual decline in temperature followed by a slight increase, indicating a typical diurnal pattern with cooler night-time temperatures and a modest warming trend during the day. Humidity levels fluctuated, with notable increases during the early hours, typical of overnight accumulation, but then decreased towards the evening, suggesting drier air moving into the area. Air pressure showed a consistent downward trend, which could signal the approach of a weather system with the potential for changing weather conditions such as increased cloudiness or precipitation. Wind speeds were variable but generally light to moderate, with periods of calm winds; however, there was an increase in wind speed towards the end of the period. The wind direction shifted significantly throughout the day, with a predominantly westerly direction in the early hours that transitioned to northerly and then varied directions, which may influence the transport of air masses and the resultant local weather.
