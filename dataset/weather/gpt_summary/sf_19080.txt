Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a relatively stable temperature range indicative of mild and consistent weather conditions. Humidity levels have remained high throughout the period, suggesting a damp and potentially foggy environment typical of the city's microclimate. Air pressure has shown a gradual increasing trend, which is often associated with the approach of more settled weather and could indicate improving conditions. Wind speeds have generally been light to moderate, with a slight decrease observed later in the period, which may reduce the wind chill effect felt by residents and visitors. The wind direction has been predominantly from the south, shifting slightly towards the south-southeast and then more variable later on, which may influence local weather patterns including fog dispersal along the coastline and bay.
