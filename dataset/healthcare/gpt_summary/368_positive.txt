Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a peak ratio of 26.27% in week 7, followed by a consistent decline to a low of 0.92% by week 19. The majority of positive cases were attributed to Influenza A, which surged to 25.70% in week 5 but decreased to 0.70% by week 20, indicating a substantial reduction in Influenza A activity. Conversely, Influenza B maintained a relatively low and stable presence throughout the period, with a slight increase in the last week to 0.35%. The significant decrease in overall influenza positivity from the peak weeks could suggest a waning of the influenza season, potentially easing the burden on healthcare resources. However, the healthcare system should remain vigilant for any signs of resurgence, particularly given the slight uptick in Influenza B cases in the most recent week.
