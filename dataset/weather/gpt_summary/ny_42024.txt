Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching a peak in the late afternoon before a slight decrease towards the evening. Humidity levels started moderately high and saw a significant drop in the afternoon, indicating drier conditions, before partially rebounding later in the day. Air pressure has been relatively stable, with a slight downward trend suggesting a potential change in weather patterns. Wind speeds remained light throughout the period, with some variability in speed and a shift in direction from southerly to westerly in the afternoon, which is consistent with the passage of a weather front. The combination of rising temperatures, falling humidity, and changing wind patterns could suggest the approach of a high-pressure system, often associated with clearer skies and warmer weather.
