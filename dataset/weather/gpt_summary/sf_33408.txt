Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have experienced a diurnal cycle with a noticeable cooling trend during the early hours, followed by a significant warming trend as the day progressed, peaking towards the latter part of the reported period. Humidity levels varied widely, with a notable increase towards the middle of the period, which could have contributed to a feeling of increased mugginess, potentially affecting comfort levels. Air pressure remained relatively stable for a majority of the time, with a slight decrease towards the end, which could be indicative of an approaching weather system or front. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a brief period of increased intensity, and the wind direction showed variability with a mix of northerly and westerly components, suggesting a changing weather pattern. The combination of rising temperatures, variable humidity, and the slight drop in air pressure could suggest a change in weather conditions in the near future, possibly the arrival of a new weather system.
