Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a general upward trend, increasing from 2995.68 to 3087.01, which suggests a positive sentiment in the U.S. equity market. The VIX, commonly referred to as the "fear index," has slightly decreased from 13.54 to 12.69, indicating a reduction in market volatility and an increase in investor confidence. In the commodities market, Gold Futures have experienced a downward trend, moving from 1477.60 to 1455.50, which could suggest a shift of investor preference from safe-haven assets to riskier ones, consistent with the rise in equity markets. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 indices have moved in a less pronounced upward trend compared to the S&P 500, ending at 23331.84 and 7328.50 respectively, pointing to a moderate positive outlook in UK and Japanese equity markets. The foreign exchange rates have seen the US dollar strengthening against the Japanese yen (from 108.39 to 109.23) and the Chinese yuan (from 7.07 to 6.99), while remaining relatively stable against the euro, which could reflect a stronger U.S. economic performance relative to Japan and China, or differing central bank policies.
