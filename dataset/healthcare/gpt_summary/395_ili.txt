Over the past 20 weeks, the percentage of patients with Influenza-like Illness (ILI) has shown a notable increasing trend, moving from a ratio of 1.53% in the first week to a peak of 7.37% in week 16, surpassing the 2.9% severity benchmark from week 12 onwards. The age groups 0-4 and 5-24 years demonstrated the most significant rise in ILI cases, with the 0-4 age group increasing from 8,659 to 28,976 cases and the 5-24 age group rising sharply from 7,476 to 55,613 cases over the 20-week period. The data indicates a substantial burden on the healthcare system, particularly within pediatric services, given the high volume of young patients. The consistent increase in ILI cases among all age groups suggests widespread community transmission of influenza, warranting public health interventions. The recent slight decline in ILI patient ratio to 6.46% in the final week, while still above the severity threshold, may indicate a potential plateau or early signs of a downward trend in ILI prevalence.
