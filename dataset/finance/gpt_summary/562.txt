Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a general upward trend, increasing from 3974.54 to 4180.17, suggesting a positive sentiment among investors. The VIX, or Volatility Index, has fluctuated but ended slightly lower at 17.33 compared to its starting value of 18.86, indicating a decrease in market volatility and a more stable market outlook. During the same period, the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 indices experienced volatility with the Nikkei closing lower at 29020.63 from an opening of 29176.70, and the FTSE 100 showing more resilience with a slight increase from 6740.60 to 6938.60, reflecting regional market differences.

Commodity prices such as Gold Futures and Crude Oil Futures have both seen upward movements, with Gold increasing from 1732.20 to 1777.00 and Crude Oil rising from 60.97 to 62.14, possibly due to inflationary pressures and global economic recovery expectations. The exchange rates have remained relatively stable with minor appreciation in the EUR/USD, a slight depreciation in USD/JPY, and stability in USD/CNY, suggesting a steady currency market with potential shifts in trade balances and international investment flows.
