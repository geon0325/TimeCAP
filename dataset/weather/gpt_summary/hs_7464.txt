Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a considerable fluctuation in temperature, with a general trend of warming during the day before cooling off slightly at night. Humidity levels showed a significant increase overnight, reaching saturation, which could have led to morning fog or dew before dropping sharply as temperatures rose again. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor variations, suggesting a steady weather pattern without significant fronts or storms moving through the area. Wind speed varied modestly, with periods of calm and gentle breezes, and there was a slight increase later in the day, which may have contributed to dispersing humidity. Wind direction was predominantly from the south, shifting slightly throughout the day, which is typical for the region and often associated with warmer air being drawn up from the Gulf of Mexico.
