Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced a moderate fluctuation in temperature with a general warming trend peaking in the afternoon before cooling slightly towards the evening. Humidity levels started relatively high and saw a gradual decrease through the day, suggesting a transition from more moist to drier conditions as temperatures rose. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight dip, indicating consistent atmospheric conditions with no significant weather fronts moving through the area during this period. Wind speeds were light to moderate and increased slightly as the day progressed, which could have contributed to the dispersion of humidity and a slight cooling effect. The wind direction was predominantly from the southeast, with some variability, which is typical for Houston and often associated with warm, moist air coming in from the Gulf of Mexico.
