Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has followed a typical diurnal pattern, with a gradual increase through the daytime and a decrease at night, recently peaking in the late afternoon. Humidity levels were notably high, frequently reaching saturation, which suggests a likelihood of fog or dew formation, particularly during the early morning hours when temperatures were at their lowest. Air pressure experienced slight fluctuations but remained relatively stable, with a moderate increase towards the latter part of the period, which could indicate the approach of a high-pressure system possibly leading to calmer weather conditions. Wind speeds varied minimally and were generally light, while wind direction shifted throughout the day, suggesting the absence of a dominant weather front. The combination of high humidity, stable air pressure, and light winds could lead to muggy conditions, with limited wind-driven relief.
