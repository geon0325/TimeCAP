Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with a notable drop mid-period, suggesting a period of market uncertainty, which is corroborated by a corresponding spike in the VIX, peaking at 24.59 before settling slightly lower. International indices also reflected this uncertainty, with Japan's Nikkei 225 and the UK's FTSE 100 experiencing declines, indicating a potential global sentiment of risk aversion. Gold Futures rose during this period, peaking at $1519.60, which is typical during times of market stress as investors seek safe-haven assets. Crude Oil Futures fluctuated but trended downward, pointing to possible concerns over future economic growth and demand. Exchange rates saw the USD strengthening against the JPY but weakening against the CNY, while the EUR/USD remained relatively stable, suggesting a complex interplay of currency valuation influenced by differing economic indicators and market perceptions.
