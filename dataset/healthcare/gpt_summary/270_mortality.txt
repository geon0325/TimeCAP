Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a declining trend in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia when compared to the total number of deaths, with an early peak of 7.92% followed by a decrease to a low of 5.81%, and then a slight uptick towards the end of the period to 6.42%. Despite the fluctuations in the total number of deaths, the absolute number of deaths attributed to Influenza has significantly decreased from a high of 106 deaths in the seventh week to 24 deaths in the final week. In contrast, the number of deaths from pneumonia started at 4833 in the first week and ended at 3810 in the twentieth week, showing a general decrease but with some weekly fluctuations and a small increase towards the end of the period. The average ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia over the last 20 weeks is 6.37%, which is lower than the provided average of 7.84%, indicating a relative decrease in the impact of these illnesses on overall mortality. This trend suggests a potential easing of the burden on healthcare systems from these respiratory illnesses but warrants continued monitoring for any signs of resurgence, especially considering the slight increase in the ratio towards the end of the observed period.
