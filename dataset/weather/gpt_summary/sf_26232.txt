Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a slight decrease in temperature, which is typical during the night, followed by a moderate increase during the day, maintaining relatively mild conditions. Humidity levels have shown some fluctuation but remained high for the most part, suggesting a persistent presence of moisture in the air that could lead to foggy conditions, especially near coastal areas. Air pressure has been stable with a slight increase, indicating steady weather without the immediate likelihood of significant weather systems moving in. Wind speeds have generally been moderate to light, with some variability, which is typical for San Francisco's microclimates and is unlikely to cause any weather disturbances. Lastly, the wind direction has been variable, with a general tendency toward westerly and northwesterly directions, which is common for this region and could contribute to the advection of cooler air from the ocean over the city.
