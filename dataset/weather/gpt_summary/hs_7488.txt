Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, peaking in the late afternoon before stabilizing slightly below the maximum towards the evening. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, starting at moderate levels before rising to saturation overnight and then dropping drastically towards the end of the period, indicating the possibility of a weather front passing through the area. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout most of the day, with a notable drop occurring later on, which could suggest an approaching weather system. Wind speeds were generally light and variable, with a slight increase observed during the period of lowest humidity and air pressure drop. The wind direction was predominantly from the south, shifting more towards the south-southeast in the later hours, which is typical for the area and may have contributed to the increase in temperature.
