Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced relatively stable temperatures with a slight warming trend observed in the later hours. Humidity levels increased significantly through the day, potentially contributing to a feeling of increased cold despite the stable temperature range. Atmospheric pressure showed a minor decrease, which could suggest an approaching weather system or front. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with some variability in speed and a gradual shift in direction from westerly to northeasterly, indicating a possible change in weather patterns. The calm winds during the middle of the period could have led to a buildup of humidity and possibly fog, affecting visibility and overall air quality.
