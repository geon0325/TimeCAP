Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a general increase in temperature during the day, followed by a gradual decrease towards the evening and into the night, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels have varied significantly, starting on the lower side, increasing to very high levels, and then decreasing again, which could have affected how comfortable the temperatures felt throughout the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting no major weather systems moving through the area during this period. Wind speeds were mostly light but ended with a sharp increase in the last recorded hour, which could indicate the onset of more active weather or the approach of a frontal system. Lastly, the wind direction shifted dramatically in the final hours, moving from southerly to northerly directions, which may bring changes in temperature and humidity levels following the shift.
