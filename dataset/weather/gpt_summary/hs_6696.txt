Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature followed by a subsequent increase, suggesting a typical diurnal temperature variation with cooler conditions overnight and warmer conditions during the day. Humidity levels have been relatively high, peaking during the early hours, which is common in Houston's humid subtropical climate and may have contributed to a muggy feel for residents throughout the night and early morning. Air pressure remained fairly steady with only minor fluctuations, indicating stable weather conditions without the presence of significant frontal systems. Wind speeds were mostly light with periods of calm, but there was a notable increase during the afternoon, which could have provided some relief from the day's warmth. Wind direction showed variability, with a notable shift from predominantly easterly directions to a westerly direction in the late evening, which could signal the passage of a weather front or the influence of local sea breezes.
