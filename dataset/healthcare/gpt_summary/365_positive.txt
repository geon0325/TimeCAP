Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in influenza activity as evidenced by the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, peaking at 26.27% in week 10 and declining to 1.08% by week 20. Influenza A has been the predominant strain throughout the period, with its highest detection rate at 26.15% in week 10, but it saw a significant decrease to 0.81% by the last week. In contrast, the presence of Influenza B remained relatively low and stable, with a slight uptick from 0.10% in week 2 to 0.27% by week 20. The sharp peak and subsequent decline in Influenza A cases suggest a potentially waning flu season, but the healthcare system must remain vigilant for any signs of resurgence or shifts in strain dominance. Continuing to monitor these trends is essential for resource allocation, vaccination strategies, and public health interventions to manage the burden of influenza on the healthcare system.
