Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia to the total number of deaths has demonstrated a downward trend, decreasing from 6.15% to 4.90%, which is below the average ratio of 7.84% reported for these conditions. Despite fluctuations in the total number of deaths, which peaked at 53,971 in the first week and decreased to a low of 51,610 by the last week, the number of deaths attributed to Influenza has steadily declined from 97 to 16. Pneumonia-related deaths also showed a decreasing pattern, starting at 3,223 and reducing to 2,515 by the end of the 20-week period. This overall decline in the mortality ratio suggests an improvement in the management or prevention of these respiratory conditions. However, the persistent presence of these deaths underscores the ongoing need for healthcare resources and monitoring to address and mitigate the impact of Influenza and Pneumonia within the population.
