Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have exhibited a typical diurnal pattern with a peak during the afternoon hours and a gradual decrease towards the early morning. The relative humidity has shown significant variability, dropping markedly during the hottest part of the day but increasing substantially at night and early morning, indicating the presence of moisture in the air that could contribute to discomfort and possibly morning dew or fog formation. Air pressure has been relatively stable, with a slight downward trend in the latest readings, which might suggest a gradual change in the weather pattern. Wind speeds have remained consistently light, with little fluctuation, suggesting a period of calm weather conditions. The wind direction has varied but has predominantly been from the east to southeast, which is typical for Houston and can contribute to bringing in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico.
