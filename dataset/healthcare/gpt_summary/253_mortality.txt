Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia as a proportion of total deaths started at 11.76% and peaked at 18.51% in week 8, significantly exceeding the average ratio of 7.84%. After this peak, there was a notable decline in the mortality ratio, concluding at 6.88% in the final week, which is below the average. The total number of deaths fluctuated, with an initial increase from 68,729 to a high of 86,858 by week 8, followed by a general decline to 58,517 by week 20. Deaths attributed to pneumonia were the major contributor to this trend, with a high of 16,037 deaths in week 8, decreasing to 3,942 by week 20. The observed peak and subsequent decline in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia could indicate a seasonal pattern or the effectiveness of public health interventions, warranting continued surveillance and healthcare resource allocation to manage future outbreaks.
