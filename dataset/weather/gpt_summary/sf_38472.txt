Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have seen a slight fluctuation, with a general cooling trend after a minor warm-up during the day. Humidity levels were consistently high, indicative of a very moist air mass over the area, with a noticeable drop in the afternoon, which could suggest a period of drier conditions. Air pressure experienced a significant increase, reaching a peak before starting to decrease slightly, suggesting a strengthening high-pressure system followed by a gradual lessening. Wind speeds varied, with a period of stronger winds transitioning to calmer conditions and then increasing slightly again, while wind directions shifted from predominantly southerly to variable, including an easterly phase, which is atypical for the region. These combined indicators point to a stable weather pattern that was briefly interrupted, but with the high humidity and increasing pressure, it is likely to remain mostly calm with potential for fog development, especially along coastal areas.
