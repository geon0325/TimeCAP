The analysis of the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data over the last 20 weeks reveals a notable seasonal trend with a peak in ILI percentage ratios that significantly exceed the baseline early in the period, followed by a gradual decline over time. The highest ratios of ILI patients were observed in the younger age groups, particularly in those aged 0-4 and 5-24, which is a common pattern due to higher transmission rates in schools and daycare centers. The overall number of patients has decreased towards the latest weeks, and concurrently, the ILI percentage ratios have also fallen below the baseline, suggesting a potential easing of the ILI incidence in the population. However, as the rates for ILI remain above the baseline for a substantial portion of the 20-week period, this trend may have placed a considerable strain on healthcare resources, including increased demand for medical visits, diagnostic testing, and possible hospitalizations. It is critical for healthcare providers and public health officials to continue monitoring these trends, promote vaccination, and prepare for potential surges in ILI cases, especially among the most affected age groups.
