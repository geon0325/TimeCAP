Over the last 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have shown a gradual increase, indicative of warming conditions that peaked in the late afternoon before a slight decline towards the evening. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with periods of complete saturation suggesting the possibility of fog or heavy dew, and lower levels that likely contributed to more comfortable conditions. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable with only minor fluctuations, indicating steady weather patterns without the presence of strong frontal systems. Wind speeds varied from light to moderate, with occasional gusts that may have influenced the dispersion of humidity and the perception of temperature. The prevailing wind direction was predominantly from the southeast to the south, which is typical for the region and may have contributed to the moisture-laden air associated with the high humidity levels experienced.
