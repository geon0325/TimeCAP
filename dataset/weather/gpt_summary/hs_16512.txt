Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has shown a gradual increase, transitioning from relatively warm to hotter conditions, indicative of a typical day-to-night cycle transitioning back to daytime heating. Humidity levels started moderately high and increased towards the early morning hours, which is common when temperatures are cooler, before decreasing significantly as temperatures rose, suggesting an inverse relationship between temperature and humidity. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with only minor fluctuations, indicating a period of stable weather without significant frontal activity or storms. Wind speeds were mostly light to gentle and displayed little variability, while wind direction was predominantly from the south-southeast, which could contribute to advecting moist air from the Gulf of Mexico into the region. Collectively, the steady air pressure, consistent wind direction, and typical diurnal temperature variation suggest stable but warm and humid conditions prevailing over Houston.
