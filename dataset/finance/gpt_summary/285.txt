Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 experienced significant volatility with a sharp decline from 3373.23 to 2398.10, indicating increased market uncertainty and bearish sentiment. Correspondingly, the VIX, a measure of market volatility, showed a substantial increase, peaking at 82.69, which reflects heightened investor fear. The international equity indices, Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100, also followed a downward trend, with the Nikkei dropping from 23479.15 to 16726.55 and the FTSE from 7436.60 to 5080.60, signaling a global risk-off mood. Commodity prices were mixed with Gold Futures initially rising, possibly due to its safe-haven status, but subsequently falling to 1477.30, while Crude Oil Futures plummeted from 53.78 to 20.37, suggesting a major demand shock possibly exacerbated by the OPEC+ dynamics. Exchange rates saw the EUR/USD peaking at 1.14 and then retracting to 1.10, and the USD strengthening against the JPY and CNY, which may indicate a flight to liquidity and the U.S. dollar's perceived safe-haven status amidst global financial turmoil.
