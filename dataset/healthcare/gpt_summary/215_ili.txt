Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a marked decline in the number of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases across all age groups, with the most significant decrease observed in the youngest cohort aged 0-4. The ratio of ILI patients to total patients has steadily decreased, falling below the baseline of 2.9% in the latter half of the observed period, indicating a reduction in the overall prevalence of ILI within the population. Despite this downward trend, the initial weeks showed a ratio significantly higher than the baseline, suggesting an earlier surge that may have put additional strain on healthcare resources. The consistent decline across all age groups may reflect the effects of seasonality, public health interventions, or natural disease progression. As the ILI ratio has now dipped below the baseline, it suggests a current easing of ILI-related healthcare demand, potentially allowing for reallocation of resources to other areas of need within the healthcare system.
