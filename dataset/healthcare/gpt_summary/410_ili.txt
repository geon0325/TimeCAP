Over the last 20 weeks, the proportion of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases among all patients presented a declining trend, starting from a high of 7.37% in week 2 and ending at 2.35% in week 20, which is below the 2.9% severity benchmark. The highest burden of ILI was observed in the younger age groups (0-4 and 5-24 years), peaking in the first few weeks, with a subsequent decrease indicative of a waning transmission or possibly effective public health interventions. Although there was a significant decrease in the ILI ratio over the 20-week period, the number of ILI cases among the elderly (65 years or more) did not reduce proportionately, suggesting sustained vulnerability in this demographic. Weeks 1 through 16 consistently exceeded the severity threshold of 2.9%, potentially indicating a strained healthcare system during this period, with a need for increased medical resources and possibly impacting other healthcare services. The recent drop below the severity threshold could signal a transition out of the high-risk period, allowing for resource reallocation and a focus on recovery and preparation for potential future outbreaks.
