Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have shown a typical diurnal pattern, starting off warmer, cooling during the night, and warming up again towards the end of the period. Humidity levels experienced significant fluctuations, with notably lower humidity during the warmer afternoon hours, which could indicate the presence of drier air moving into the area. Air pressure has been on a gradual decline, suggesting a potential change in weather patterns, such as the approach of a low-pressure system which could lead to unsettled weather conditions. Wind speeds have been variable but generally light, with a few periods of higher gusts, and the predominant wind direction has shifted throughout the day, which is typical for coastal cities influenced by sea breezes and varying weather systems. The combination of declining pressure and variable wind conditions might contribute to changes in the local weather, possibly leading to increased cloudiness or a chance of precipitation.
