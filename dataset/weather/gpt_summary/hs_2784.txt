Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has shown a typical diurnal pattern, with cooler temperatures in the early hours warming up towards the afternoon before cooling again at night. Humidity levels have been high, even reaching saturation at one point, which could indicate the presence of fog or mist, particularly when the wind speed was at its lowest. Air pressure has been relatively stable, with a noticeable increase at one point, which could suggest the movement of a high-pressure system into the area. Wind speeds have been mostly light to gentle, with a brief period of higher speeds, and the wind direction has been variable, although predominantly southerly, shifting to a more southeasterly direction towards the end of the period. These conditions combined suggest a stable weather pattern with no immediate signs of severe weather but with a chance of morning mist or fog due to the high humidity and low wind speeds at certain times.
