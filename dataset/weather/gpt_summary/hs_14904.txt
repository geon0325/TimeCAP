Over the last 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have shown a tendency to rise, reaching the peak during the later hours, which indicates a warmer trend moving through the area. Humidity levels started moderately but increased significantly overnight, which could have led to a muggy feeling, before gradually decreasing again, suggesting a possible relief from the oppressive humidity. Air pressure experienced some fluctuations with a notable increase at one point, potentially signaling a transient high-pressure system that could be responsible for clearer skies following its passage. Wind speeds have been generally light to moderate, with no significant gusts, indicating a relatively stable atmospheric condition. The wind direction has been predominantly from the south-southeast, which is typical for Houston and could contribute to the transport of warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico into the region.
