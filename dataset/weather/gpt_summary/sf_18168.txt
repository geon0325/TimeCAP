Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a slight fluctuation in temperature with a general increase towards the end of the period, suggesting a warming trend. Humidity levels have seen a significant decrease from near saturation to much drier conditions, which could imply a shift from foggier to clearer skies. Air pressure has been relatively stable but showed a slight downward trend, indicating a potential for changing weather patterns such as increasing chances of wind or precipitation. Wind speeds have remained consistently light, which often leads to more localized weather conditions due to the lack of significant air mass movement.
