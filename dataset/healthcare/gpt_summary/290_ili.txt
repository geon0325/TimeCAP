Over the past 20 weeks, the data reveals a gradual increase in the proportion of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases among the patient population, with the ratio of ILI patients consistently rising and currently remaining above the baseline threshold. This increase is observed across all age groups, but it is particularly notable in the 25-49 age bracket, which has seen a significant growth in ILI cases. The age group 0-4 years also experienced a marked rise in ILI cases, which may indicate higher transmission within settings such as daycares and preschools. The sustained growth in ILI cases among older populations, especially those aged 65 and above, poses additional risks due to their potential for more severe outcomes. This trend suggests a growing burden on the healthcare system, necessitating increased vigilance, resource allocation, and public health interventions to manage the rising incidence of influenza-like illnesses.
