Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable upward trend in the ratio of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a significant increase from 0.87% in week 1 to 3.35% in week 20, surpassing the 20-week average of 6.26%. Influenza A has shown a more pronounced increase, with positive specimen ratios rising from 0.38% to 2.44%, while Influenza B also showed an increase but at a more moderate rate, from 0.49% to 0.91%. The overall number of specimens tested peaked in week 19 with 19,060 tests before slightly declining in week 20 to 18,520, indicating sustained high testing volumes. The absolute number of positive specimens for both Influenza A and B has increased substantially, with Influenza A rising from 24 to 451 positive cases, and Influenza B from 31 to 169 cases over the monitored period. This trend suggests a growing burden on healthcare resources due to influenza and highlights the need for increased vigilance, preventive measures, and possibly expanded medical resource allocation to manage the rising incidence of the disease.
