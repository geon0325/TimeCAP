Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature, displaying a typical diurnal cycle with cooler conditions at night warming up towards the afternoon. Humidity levels varied significantly, with a peak that coincided with the lowest temperatures, suggesting the formation of early morning fog or mist, a common occurrence in this coastal city. Air pressure saw a slight but steady increase throughout the day, indicative of stable weather conditions moving in, which could lead to clearer skies. Wind speeds were generally mild but showed some variability, with a period of calm winds at one point, which could have contributed to the higher humidity levels by allowing moisture to accumulate. The wind direction was predominantly westerly, as is typical for San Francisco, with occasional shifts that could influence coastal fog dispersal and onshore temperature changes.
