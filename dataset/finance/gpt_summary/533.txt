Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 exhibited slight volatility with a modest upward trend, closing higher by approximately 0.2% from the beginning of the period. The VIX, which measures market volatility, has shown a gradual decrease, suggesting an increase in investor confidence as it moved from just under 20 to around 20.7, a sign of stabilizing market sentiment. International indices like the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have both rebounded after experiencing dips, with the Nikkei 225 closing with more than a 0.6% increase, reflecting positive investor sentiment in Asian and European markets. Gold Futures faced a downward trend, suggesting a shift in investor preference away from safe-haven assets, possibly due to rising bond yields or a stronger equity market. Crude Oil Futures were volatile yet finished higher, indicating potential concerns over supply constraints or expectations of increasing demand as economies seek recovery from the pandemic impact.
