Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has experienced typical diurnal variation, with a notable increase during daylight hours followed by a gradual cooling trend overnight into the early morning. Relative humidity levels demonstrated an inverse correlation with temperature, increasing as the temperature dropped and peaking during the early morning hours, which may have led to the formation of early morning fog or dew. Air pressure has remained relatively stable, showing a slight but steady increase throughout the day which suggests a period of settled weather without any significant frontal systems passing through the area. Wind speeds have been mostly light to moderate and showed reduced activity during the night, which is typical under stable atmospheric conditions. The wind direction has been variable but predominantly from a northeasterly to easterly direction, possibly influencing local temperature and humidity levels with maritime air.
