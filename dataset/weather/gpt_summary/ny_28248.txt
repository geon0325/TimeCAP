Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature, maintaining a generally cool trend with the lowest point during the early hours and a slight increase towards the end of the period. Humidity levels were consistently high, with several instances of reaching saturation, which could have led to foggy conditions or a sense of mugginess. Air pressure varied but showed a gradual increase in the middle of the period, suggesting a brief period of more stable weather conditions before a slight decrease towards the end. Wind speeds were mostly light with occasional moderate gusts, and the wind direction shifted significantly throughout the day, starting from westerly, turning to northerly, and ending with calm conditions. These conditions indicate a relatively stable yet humid weather pattern, with a potential for changes as suggested by the variations in air pressure and wind direction.
