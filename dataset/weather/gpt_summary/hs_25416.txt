Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have displayed a typical diurnal pattern with a notable increase during the daytime, reaching a peak in the late afternoon before gradually decreasing through the night. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with notably high values during the early morning hours, suggesting the possibility of morning fog or dew, and then decreasing as temperatures rose, indicative of a drier atmosphere during peak heat. Air pressure remained relatively stable with only minor variations; such steadiness in pressure often points to a lack of immediate significant weather changes. Wind speeds were generally light with a few periods of slightly higher gusts, and the wind direction varied widely throughout the day, which is characteristic of a region not dominated by a single weather front. The combination of rising temperatures, lowering humidity, stable pressure, and light variable winds suggest a calm weather pattern for Houston with no immediate signs of severe weather activity.
