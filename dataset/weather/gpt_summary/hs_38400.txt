Over the past 24 hours, the weather in Houston has displayed a notable fluctuation in temperature, showing a gradual decrease followed by a significant increase, and then a slight drop towards the end of the period. Humidity levels started relatively moderate, rose to very high levels during the cooler early morning hours, and then decreased substantially as temperatures increased. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight downward trend observed, which could be indicative of changing weather patterns such as the approach of a weather front. Wind speeds were mostly constant with a slight decrease midday, before returning to their initial values, suggesting stable atmospheric conditions. The wind direction was predominantly from the south, with minor variations, which is typical for Houston and could be contributing to the warmer temperatures experienced during the latter part of the time period.
