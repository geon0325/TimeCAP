Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures showed a warming trend, reaching their peak during the late afternoon before gradually cooling down towards the evening. Relative humidity levels inversely correlated with temperature changes, starting at moderate levels in the early hours, increasing significantly as temperatures dropped, and then decreasing as temperatures rose again. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable, with only minor fluctuations, indicating no significant weather fronts moving through the area. Wind speeds were generally light throughout the day, with minimal variation, suggesting calm weather conditions. However, wind direction varied, including a notable shift to a southerly direction during the early morning hours before predominantly settling into an easterly to northeasterly direction for the remainder of the period, which could influence moisture convergence in the region.
