Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a noticeable fluctuation in temperature, with a general trend of cooling during the night that transitioned to a warming pattern throughout the day. Humidity levels varied significantly, reaching a peak during the cooler early morning hours and then dropping during the warmer afternoon before rising again towards the evening. Air pressure remained relatively stable for most of the period but showed a sharp decrease in the last few hours, which could indicate an approaching weather system that may affect local conditions soon. Wind speeds were mostly moderate but showed some variability, with occasional gusts; the prevailing winds shifted primarily between westerly and northerly directions. The combination of changing humidity, a drop in air pressure, and varying wind conditions suggests the potential for unsettled weather in the near future.
