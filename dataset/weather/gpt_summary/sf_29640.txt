Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have shown a typical diurnal cycle, with a gradual decrease overnight reaching a nadir around dawn, followed by a warming trend during the day. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, starting lower, increasing around early morning to a peak that indicates possible fog or mist formation, then dropping to very low levels in the afternoon which could enhance the risk of wildfire spread, before rising again late at night. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with only minor fluctuations that suggest stable weather conditions. Wind speeds varied, with generally moderate values, and a notable increase during the daytime hours, which could contribute to rapid changes in temperature and humidity. The wind direction shifted from predominantly southerly to westerly and northwesterly by the end of the period, which may bring in cooler marine air affecting local climate conditions.
