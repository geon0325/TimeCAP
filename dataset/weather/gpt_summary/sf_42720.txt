Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a noticeable diurnal temperature variation with a cooling trend during the nighttime hours followed by a warming trend after sunrise. Relative humidity levels remained high throughout the night and early morning, indicative of possible fog or low clouds which is typical for coastal California climates, but these levels dropped significantly by the end of the period, suggesting clearer conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight increase towards the middle of the period, which could be associated with transient high-pressure conditions that often bring fair weather. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with a significant increase towards the end of the period, possibly signaling a change in weather patterns or the arrival of a weather front. The wind direction was variable throughout the period, with notable shifts from northerly to southerly and back to northerly, which is characteristic of the complex coastal wind patterns influenced by both land and sea breezes.
