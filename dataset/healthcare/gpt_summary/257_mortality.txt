Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable downward trend in the percentage of deaths due to Influenza or Pneumonia in relation to the total number of deaths, starting from a peak of 18.51% and ending at 6.03%, a decrease of more than 12 percentage points. Despite fluctuations in the total number of deaths, the absolute number of deaths attributed to Influenza or Pneumonia has consistently declined, with pneumonia deaths decreasing from 13,269 to 3,310, and influenza-related deaths initially low, spiking at 187, and then rising more steadily from 29 to 106 in the final week. The observed decrease in the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia suggests improvements in prevention, treatment, or a seasonal reduction in incidence. However, the recent increase in deaths from influenza warrants attention and could suggest a resurgence or the onset of a new seasonal wave. Healthcare systems should remain vigilant and may need to adjust resource allocation to address the potential increase in influenza cases, while also maintaining efforts that have contributed to the overall reduction in pneumonia-related mortality.
