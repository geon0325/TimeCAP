Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has seen a moderate fluctuation, generally increasing during the daytime with a peak in the late afternoon before gradually cooling off towards the early morning hours. Humidity levels varied significantly, with lower values during the heat of the day and a substantial increase during the night and early morning, indicative of a more muggy atmosphere during those times. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with only minor variations, suggesting a period of steady weather without the immediate influence of strong frontal systems. Wind speeds were mostly gentle to moderate, with slight increases towards the end of the period, while the wind direction was predominantly from the south, with occasional shifts, which is typical for Houston and may contribute to the transport of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. The combination of these weather indicators points to warm, humid conditions that are common in this region, with no immediate signs of severe weather disruptions.
