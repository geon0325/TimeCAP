Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have experienced a moderate fluctuation, showing a general cooling trend overnight followed by a warming trend during the day. Humidity levels hit their peak at full saturation, possibly indicating the presence of fog or mist during the early hours, but gradually decreased as temperatures rose. Air pressure has been steadily increasing throughout the period, suggesting a period of stable weather conditions may be setting in. Wind speeds have remained relatively light and consistent, with minimal variation, which is typical for San Francisco's coastal climate. The wind direction has been predominantly from the southwest, gradually shifting to a more westerly direction, which is common for this region and could be associated with the maritime influence on local weather patterns.
