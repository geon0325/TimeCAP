Over the past day in San Francisco, temperatures have experienced a modest fluctuation with a general cooling trend towards the middle of the period followed by a subsequent warming trend. Humidity levels have seen quite a variation, starting at moderate levels, increasing significantly, and then decreasing sharply towards the end of the period, suggesting a passing weather front. Air pressure readings were fairly stable initially but then showed a notable increase, indicative of a high-pressure system moving in, which often leads to clearer conditions. Wind speeds were mostly light to gentle, although there were periods of increased wind activity, especially towards the later hours. Wind direction varied significantly, with shifts from southerly to westerly and then to more northwesterly directions, which could suggest the movement of a weather system through the area.
