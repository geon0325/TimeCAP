Over the past 20 weeks, the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) trends have shown a fluctuating pattern, with a notable increase in the percentage of ILI patients, surpassing the baseline threshold in later weeks, suggesting a significant uptick in ILI activity. The age group most affected is consistently the 5-24 years bracket, followed by the 0-4 years and 25-49 years age groups, indicating that younger populations may be more susceptible to ILI or are seeking care more frequently. The 50-64 and 65 or more age groups have lower ILI patient counts but still show an upward trend that cannot be overlooked as it may imply increasing vulnerability or reporting in these age brackets. The peak in the percentage of ILI patients in the recent weeks could strain healthcare resources, necessitating preparedness in managing increased patient loads and potential hospitalizations. This data underscores the importance of continued surveillance and possibly enhanced public health interventions such as vaccination campaigns, especially targeting the most affected age groups, to mitigate the impact of ILI on the population and healthcare systems.
