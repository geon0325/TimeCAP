Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a marked increase in the number of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the ratio of positive specimens more than doubling from 1.22% to 2.20%. This trend is reflected in both Influenza A and B, with positive cases for Influenza A rising from 0.41% to 1.52%, and Influenza B from 0.81% to 0.68% of tested specimens. The most significant jump occurred in the last five weeks, where the ratio of positive specimens surged from 1.40% to 2.20%, suggesting a rapid escalation in the spread of influenza. Despite Influenza B starting at a higher positivity rate, Influenza A has surpassed it, indicating a shift in the dominant strain. This uptick in influenza cases could lead to increased hospitalizations, stressing healthcare resources, and necessitates heightened surveillance and possibly a review of public health interventions to manage the spread.
