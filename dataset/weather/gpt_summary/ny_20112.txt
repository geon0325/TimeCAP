Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual rise in temperature transitioning from below freezing to milder conditions. Humidity levels have shown an increasing trend, reaching near saturation in the later hours, which could suggest the presence of fog or mist, especially during the cooler parts of the day. Air pressure has been consistently decreasing, indicating a system moving in that could lead to weather instability or potential precipitation. Wind speeds remained light throughout the period, with calm conditions prevailing at one point, which may have contributed to the accumulation of humidity and a lack of dispersion of any pollutants. The wind direction shifted significantly from southerly to northerly and then to westerly, suggesting the passage of a weather front and a change in the weather pattern.
