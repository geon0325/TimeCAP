Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have seen a gradual decrease, indicative of a cooling trend. Humidity levels were very high throughout the day, reaching saturation during the early hours, which could have led to foggy conditions, especially in coastal and low-lying areas. Air pressure showed a slight overall decline, suggesting the possibility of changing weather patterns or the approach of a weather front. Wind speeds remained relatively light with occasional gentle breezes, which would not have contributed significantly to dispersion of fog or pollutants. Wind direction varied, with predominantly westerly winds early on, shifting to include a mix of southerly and northerly components, which could influence the movement of coastal marine air inland.
