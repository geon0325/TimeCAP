Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a noticeable increase in temperature, culminating in a peak before slightly dropping towards the end of the observed period. Humidity levels showed a significant decrease as the temperatures rose, indicating a trend of warmer and drier conditions as the day progressed. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase towards the middle of the day, followed by a gradual decline, which could suggest a stable weather pattern with no immediate signs of significant weather disturbances. Wind speeds were generally low, with a period of calm winds around the middle of the time series, which could contribute to the increase in temperature due to reduced coastal cooling. Wind direction was predominantly from the west and northwest, which is typical for San Francisco, except for a brief shift to southerly winds, potentially bringing in cooler air from the ocean.
