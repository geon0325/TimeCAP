Over the last 20 weeks, the ratio of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) patients has remained below the baseline of 2.9%, indicating that the ILI activity is below what might be considered a heightened concern level. However, there has been a steady increase in this ratio, suggesting a gradual rise in ILI cases within the population. The increase in ILI cases is consistent across all age groups, with the most significant rise observed in the younger age groups (0-4 and 5-24 years), which could potentially indicate higher transmission rates in settings such as schools and daycare centers. The growing trend in ILI cases may lead to increased healthcare utilization and could strain healthcare resources if the trend continues upward. Continuous monitoring is critical to prepare for and manage potential outbreaks, and vaccination and public health measures should be emphasized to control the spread of ILI.
