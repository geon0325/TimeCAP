Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced remarkably stable weather conditions, with no variation in temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed, or wind direction. The unchanging temperature suggests a strong and persistent atmospheric condition, possibly under the influence of a high-pressure system. Consistent low humidity levels could have led to dry conditions, increasing the risk of wildfire in the surrounding areas if combined with other factors such as dry vegetation. The steady wind speed and direction indicate a stable air flow pattern, which is typical for regions influenced by oceanic or bay influences. The constant air pressure suggests that no significant weather fronts or storm systems were moving through the area, contributing to the prolonged period of stable weather.
