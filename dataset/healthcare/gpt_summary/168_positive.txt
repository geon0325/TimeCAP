Over the past 20 weeks, the data reveals a notable increase in the percentage of positive specimens for influenza, peaking at weeks 13 and 14 with a ratio over 26%. This surge hints at a significant seasonal outbreak, with Influenza A being the predominant strain, as its highest individual positivity ratio reached 25.36% compared to Influenza B's peak at just 1.68%. Following the peak, there has been a marked decline in overall positive specimens, with the most recent week dropping below the 20-week average of 6.26%. This downward trend suggests that the influenza wave may be subsiding, which could lead to a potential easing of the burden on healthcare resources. However, the healthcare system should remain vigilant and continue to monitor trends, as fluctuations in influenza activity are common and can have implications for healthcare capacity and public health interventions.
