The time-series data indicates a declining trend in the number of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza over the first 15 weeks, with a notable increase in the last 5 weeks, suggesting a potential onset of an influenza wave. The proportion of positive tests for Influenza A has significantly increased in the most recent week, reaching 1.90% from a low of 0.42%, which could imply a surge in Influenza A infections. Influenza B has remained a smaller fraction of positive cases throughout the period, with a slight uptick in the last week to 0.12%. Despite the recent increase, the overall percentage of positive specimens (2.02% in the latest week) is still below the 20-week average of 6.26%, indicating that the current situation is not as severe as it has been at other points during this timeframe. Healthcare providers should prepare for a potential continued increase in influenza cases, though the current levels are not unprecedented based on the 20-week analysis.
