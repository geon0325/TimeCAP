Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a gradual increase in the percentage of deaths due to Influenza or Pneumonia relative to the total number of deaths, starting at 5.74% and ending at 6.28%, which is below the average ratio of 7.84%. Despite fluctuations in the total number of deaths, there is a noticeable upward trend in both absolute numbers and the percentage of deaths attributable to Influenza or Pneumonia. In particular, the number of deaths from pneumonia has risen from 2935 to 3279, while deaths from influenza have also increased from 14 to 23 in the 20-week period. This rising trend could signal a potential stress on healthcare resources, especially if the trend continues and approaches or surpasses the average mortality ratio. The increase in mortality rates from these respiratory conditions warrants close monitoring and may necessitate targeted healthcare interventions to prevent further escalation.
