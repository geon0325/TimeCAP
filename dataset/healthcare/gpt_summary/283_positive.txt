Over the past 20 weeks, the testing of respiratory specimens has revealed an average influenza positivity rate of 6.26%, with fluctuations observed in the data. The number of specimens tested each week has generally decreased, from 34,191 in week 1 to 27,718 in week 20, which may reflect seasonal variations or changes in testing behaviors. Influenza A positivity rates have been relatively low, with a peak of 0.08% in week 11, while Influenza B has shown a more consistent presence, peaking at 0.09% in week 12. The highest overall positivity rate of 0.15% occurred in weeks 11 and 12, suggesting a possible mid-season peak for influenza infections. These trends are essential for healthcare planning, indicating the need for continued surveillance and potentially influencing vaccination and treatment strategies.
