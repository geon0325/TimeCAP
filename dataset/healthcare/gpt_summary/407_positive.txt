Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable upward trend in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the overall ratio of positive specimens increasing from 0.99% to 8.49%. This rise is primarily driven by a significant increase in Influenza A detections, which escalated from 0.58% to 6.97%, compared to Influenza B, which rose from 0.41% to 1.52%. The total number of specimens tested has also grown substantially, peaking in the last week at 144,858 tests, which may reflect a response to the increasing prevalence of influenza. The sharp rise in positive cases, particularly for Influenza A, suggests a potential strain on the healthcare system, as more patients may require medical attention for flu-related symptoms. Given the upward trajectory in positive influenza specimens, healthcare resources may need to be allocated strategically to manage the increased demand for medical care and to support vaccination and prevention efforts.
