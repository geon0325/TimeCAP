Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable downward trend in both the absolute number of deaths attributed to influenza or pneumonia and their proportion relative to total deaths. The initial ratio of mortality from influenza or pneumonia at 6.79% has decreased to 5.31%, remaining consistently below the 20-week average of 7.84%. Although total deaths fluctuated, the decline in influenza or pneumonia deaths is more pronounced, suggesting potential improvements in prevention, management, or a seasonal decline in incidence. The lowest observed weekly mortality ratio from these causes was 5.19%, indicating a significant drop from the average, which may relieve some pressure on healthcare services specifically targeting respiratory illnesses. However, vigilance is required as this decline could reverse with new seasonal trends or emerging pathogenic strains.
