Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperature displayed a typical diurnal pattern, with a peak during the daytime and a gradual decrease through the night into the early morning hours. Humidity levels remained relatively high throughout the period, with a slight decrease during the latter part of the day, indicating a consistent presence of moisture in the air. Air pressure was steady for a significant portion of the day but experienced a notable decrease towards the end, which could suggest the approach of a weather system with the potential to alter current conditions. Wind speeds varied but generally stayed light to moderate, with some calmer periods, and the wind direction shifted predominantly between northerly and westerly bearings. These conditions combined suggest a stable weather pattern with the likelihood of some changes ahead, possibly including increased wind activity or a change in weather systems due to the drop in pressure.
