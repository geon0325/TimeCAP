The analysis of the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data over the last 20 weeks reveals a distinct pattern of fluctuation in ILI incidence rates. Initially, the percentage of ILI patients stayed below the baseline, then rose significantly above the baseline, indicating a peak period of ILI cases, which could have put additional strain on healthcare resources. Following this spike, there has been a notable decline in the ratio of ILI patients, suggesting a decrease in ILI activity, but it's important to note that the latest figures are still above the minimum reported during the observed period. Age-specific data indicate that the highest number of ILI cases were consistently observed in the youngest age group (0-4 years), which might suggest a higher transmission rate or vulnerability within this demographic. While the decreasing trend in ILI cases could signal a relief for the healthcare system, continued monitoring is necessary to prepare for and manage potential future surges.
