Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature, with a general trend of cooling during the early hours and a subsequent gradual warming. Humidity levels remained predominantly high throughout the period, indicating a moist atmosphere that could contribute to a feeling of mugginess. Air pressure was relatively stable and high, suggesting settled weather conditions, although there was a slight decrease in pressure towards the end of the period which could hint at an approaching change in the weather system. Wind speeds were consistently low, indicating calm weather conditions without significant gusts or breezes. The wind direction varied but was generally from the east to southeast, which is typical for Houston's climate and could be associated with the transport of moist air from the Gulf of Mexico.
