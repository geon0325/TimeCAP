Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a slight decrease in temperature, indicating a cooling trend. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, reaching saturation at one point, which could have led to the formation of fog or mist, particularly affecting visibility during certain hours. Air pressure gradually increased over the period, signifying a potential stabilization of weather conditions or the approach of a high-pressure system, which is often associated with clearer skies. Wind speeds were mostly gentle to moderate, with occasional increases that might have contributed to a wind chill effect, making it feel cooler than actual temperatures. The wind direction was variable, predominantly from the southeast shifting towards the northeast, which is typical for changing weather patterns and could influence the transportation of air masses and moisture into the area.
