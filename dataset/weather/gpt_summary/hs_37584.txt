Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have exhibited a gradual increase, peaking during the late afternoon hours before showing a modest decline towards the evening. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with multiple instances of complete saturation, indicating the presence of fog or mist, especially during the cooler early morning and nighttime hours. Air pressure has been on a slight but steady downward trend, which could suggest an approaching weather system and the possibility of changing weather conditions. Wind speeds varied, generally remaining light to moderate but experienced a noticeable spike in the late evening, which could have dispersed humidity and brought clearer conditions temporarily. Wind direction was predominantly from the east to southeast, consistent with typical patterns for this region, but a significant shift to the south-southeast was observed in the later hours, which may influence the local weather by bringing in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico.
