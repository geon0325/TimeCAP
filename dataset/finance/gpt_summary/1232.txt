Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a general uptrend, peaking at 4768.37 before retracting slightly to 4698.35, indicating a possible cooling off after a period of gains. The VIX, which measures market volatility, has remained relatively low but saw a spike towards the end of the period to 13.67, suggesting increased market uncertainty or potential future market turbulence. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 indices have both displayed resilience with a noticeable uptrend, particularly the FTSE 100, which ended the period at a high of 7715.70, pointing towards positive investor sentiment in these markets. Gold Futures experienced some volatility, ultimately maintaining a price above $2000, reflecting investor caution and a possible hedge against inflation or market instability. The foreign exchange rates indicate a slight weakening of the USD against the EUR and JPY towards the end of the period, while the USD/CNY pair remained relatively stable, which could influence international trade dynamics and foreign investment flows.
