Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a gradual decline in the mortality ratio from influenza or pneumonia when compared to total deaths, initially exceeding the average of 7.84% but trending downwards to a low of 5.21%. The total deaths fluctuated without a clear trend over the period, ranging from 50,301 to 55,294. Deaths attributed to influenza showed a significant decrease from 300 to 5, suggesting a substantial reduction in influenza-related mortality. In contrast, deaths from pneumonia remained a more significant concern, with numbers decreasing from 3,698 to 2,616 but still accounting for the majority of deaths from these two illnesses. This decline in mortality rates from influenza or pneumonia may alleviate some strain on the healthcare system but continued monitoring is necessary to manage and respond to potential future increases.
