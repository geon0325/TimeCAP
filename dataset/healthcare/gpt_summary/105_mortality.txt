Despite fluctuations, there is a noticeable decline in the percentage of deaths attributed to Influenza or Pneumonia, with a peak of 7.75% in week 10 followed by a consistent decrease to 5.92% by week 20. The total number of deaths from all causes remained relatively stable, with minor variations week over week.
