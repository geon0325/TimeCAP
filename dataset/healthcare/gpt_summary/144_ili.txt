Over the past 20 weeks, the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) rates have shown an increasing trend, with the ratio of ILI patients significantly surpassing the baseline indicator in recent weeks, indicating an uptick in ILI cases. This rise is most pronounced in the 5-24 age group, which could suggest higher transmission rates in settings such as schools and universities. The data also reveal a notable increase in ILI cases among the elderly population, a group that is typically more vulnerable to complications from such illnesses. The healthcare system may face increased pressure due to this surge in ILI cases, necessitating resource allocation towards managing and treating ILI, and potentially impacting other healthcare services. Public health initiatives may need to focus on prevention and control measures, particularly in the most affected age groups, to mitigate the spread and impact of ILI.
