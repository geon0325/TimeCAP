Over the last 24 hours in New York City, there has been a notable warming trend with temperatures peaking in the late afternoon before gradually decreasing towards the evening. Humidity levels showed a significant drop during the day, indicating drier air moving into the area. Air pressure has been slowly decreasing throughout the period, suggesting the possibility of a changing weather system approaching. Wind speeds have been mostly light to moderate, with occasional higher gusts, and the predominance of westerly winds has been consistent, which could have contributed to the transport of drier air. The combination of decreasing humidity, lowering air pressure, and consistent wind direction may lead to clearer skies but also signals the potential for a shift in weather patterns in the near future.
