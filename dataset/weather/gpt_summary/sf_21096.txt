Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a relatively stable temperature regime, with a subtle warming trend noticed recently. Humidity levels have been high throughout the day, indicating a moist air mass over the region, which could lead to a sense of mugginess and potential for fog, especially with humidity reaching saturation at times. Atmospheric pressure has remained steady, suggesting stable weather conditions without significant changes in the immediate forecast. Wind speeds have generally decreased over the period, which could result in less dispersion of any airborne particles, potentially affecting air quality. Meanwhile, the wind direction has been predominantly from the west-northwest, although there was a notable shift to a southerly and then easterly direction in the most recent hours, which could influence local weather patterns, such as bringing different air masses into the area.
