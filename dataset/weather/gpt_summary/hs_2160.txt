Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature experienced a notable dip reaching a minimum in the early hours, before gradually rising again during the day. Humidity levels varied significantly, with a sharp increase coinciding with the temperature drop, suggesting the possible formation of early morning dew or fog. Air pressure saw a general decline throughout the period, indicating a potential change in weather patterns or the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with some variability, but did not show any extreme fluctuations that might indicate stormy conditions. The predominant wind direction was northerly, shifting to easterly later on, which could be associated with the movement of weather fronts and the transport of different air masses into the region.
