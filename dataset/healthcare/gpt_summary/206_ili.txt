Over the last 20 weeks, the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data indicates a fluctuating trend with a peak that gradually declined towards the end of the observed period. Initially, the ILI ratio was above the baseline, suggesting a higher incidence of ILI cases that put additional strain on healthcare resources. The age group of 5-24 years consistently reported the highest number of ILI cases compared to other age groups, which could implicate schools and universities as significant vectors for transmission. There has been a noticeable decrease in ILI cases across all age groups in recent weeks, with the ratio of ILI patients falling below the baseline, indicating a possible easing of the ILI burden on the healthcare system. However, the healthcare system must remain vigilant as such trends can be seasonal and cyclical, requiring ongoing monitoring and readiness for potential upticks in ILI cases.
