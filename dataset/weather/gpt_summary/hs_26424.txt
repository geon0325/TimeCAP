Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable increase in temperature, reaching a peak in the late afternoon before gradually declining toward the evening. Humidity levels experienced a significant rise during the night, hitting saturation, which may have led to the formation of fog or dew, but these levels decreased as temperatures rose throughout the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable with only minor fluctuations, indicating a steady weather pattern without the immediate approach of a significant weather front. Wind speeds were generally light and variable, suggesting calm weather conditions without strong wind-driven events. The wind direction shifted throughout the day, starting from a southeasterly direction in the early hours, veering to northerly and then settling into a more easterly direction, which can influence local temperature and humidity levels as different air masses are brought in.
