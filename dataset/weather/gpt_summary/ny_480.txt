Over the past 24 hours in New York City, the temperature has experienced a gradual increase followed by a slight decrease, indicating a typical diurnal pattern but with some variability. Humidity levels showed slight fluctuations, starting off lower, increasing toward the middle of the day, and then stabilizing at a lower percentage by the end of the 24-hour period. Air pressure has remained relatively stable, with only minor variations, suggesting a period of steady weather conditions without significant front movements or storm systems. Wind speeds were mostly moderate with occasional increases, while the wind direction was predominantly westerly, shifting slightly towards the north-west later on, which is typical for weather systems moving eastward. These conditions, with steady pressure, moderate winds, and manageable humidity, likely contributed to fair weather over the city during this period.
