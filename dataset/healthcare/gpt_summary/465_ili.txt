The time-series data for Influenza-like Illness (ILI) over the last 20 weeks indicates a decreasing trend in the proportion of ILI cases relative to total patient counts, with the initial weeks exhibiting a significantly high ratio of ILI patients (peaking at 6.90% in week 4) well above the 2.9% benchmark. This trend suggests an initially severe influenza season, with a substantial burden on healthcare resources, particularly affecting the youngest age group (0-4) and the 25-49 age bracket, as evidenced by the higher numbers of ILI patients in these categories. However, recent weeks have shown a marked decline in ILI cases across all age groups, culminating in a ratio of 1.27% in the most recent week, indicating a potential easing of the influenza situation. It is critical to monitor whether this downward trend continues, as a resurgence of ILI cases could strain healthcare systems, especially during periods when other respiratory illnesses might be prevalent. The sustained decrease in ILI cases over the last six weeks, dropping below the 2.9% threshold, could suggest the passing of the peak influenza season, but vigilance is necessary to manage potential future outbreaks.
