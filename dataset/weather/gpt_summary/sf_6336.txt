Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a noticeable drop in temperature followed by a warming trend, indicating a dynamic temperature range that may affect residents' comfort levels and energy usage. Humidity levels have shown fluctuations but remained relatively high for the majority of the period, suggesting a muggy atmosphere that could lead to a feeling of heaviness in the air and potential for fog development. Air pressure variances were observed, with a significant increase and subsequent decrease, which could be associated with changing weather patterns, such as the arrival and departure of a weather front. Wind speeds remained mostly light, suggesting limited dispersion of air pollutants and a potential for air quality issues. The wind direction varied but predominantly came from the west to southwest, which is typical for coastal areas like San Francisco and can influence coastal fog and temperature moderation.
