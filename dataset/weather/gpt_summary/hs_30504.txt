Over the last 24 hours in Houston, the temperature experienced a gradual decrease through the night, reaching its lowest point at dawn before steadily rising throughout the day. Humidity levels were inversely related to temperature changes, peaking during the coolest hours of the early morning when complete saturation was observed, and then decreasing as temperatures rose. Air pressure fluctuated, with a notable increase midday, suggesting the possible influence of a transient high-pressure system. Wind speeds remained mostly light throughout the period, with a slight increase towards the end of the period. The wind direction was predominantly from the south to southeast, shifting more significantly towards the south-southwest later in the day, which could have contributed to the warming temperatures observed in the afternoon.
