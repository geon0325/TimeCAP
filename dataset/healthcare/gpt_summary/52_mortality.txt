Over the last 20 weeks, mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia as a percentage of total deaths has shown a general downward trend, starting at 9.56% and ending at 5.92%, which is below the 20-week average of 7.84%. This suggests an overall decline in deaths from these causes relative to total mortality. The highest weekly ratio was observed in week 3 at 10.89%, while the lowest coincided with the last reported week at 5.92%. Despite this decline, the mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia still represents a significant proportion of total deaths, indicating these illnesses continue to be a substantial public health concern. The decreasing trend could reflect seasonal patterns, the impact of public health interventions, or changes in the virulence of the pathogens, and it may influence healthcare resource allocation and preventive measures such as vaccination programs.
