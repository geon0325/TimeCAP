Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable increase in both the number and the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a significant surge in the latter weeks. The total number of specimens tested weekly increased by 427%, from 6,292 in week 1 to 33,152 in week 20. The percentage of positive specimens rose substantially from 0.95% to 10.36%, greatly exceeding the 20-week average of 6.26%. Influenza A has shown a marked escalation in both absolute numbers and percentage, jumping from 43 positive specimens (0.68%) in the first week to 3,242 positive specimens (9.78%) in the last week. Influenza B, while also increasing, showed a more moderate growth, ending at 194 positive specimens (0.59%) in week 20, indicating that Influenza A is the dominant strain in the current healthcare scenario.
