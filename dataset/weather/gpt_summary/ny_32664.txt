Over the past 24 hours in New York City, the temperature exhibited a warming trend, peaking during the late afternoon hours before gradually declining towards the evening. Humidity levels experienced significant fluctuations; they were relatively high during the night, lowered substantially in the late afternoon, suggesting the possibility of a drier air mass moving into the area around that time. Atmospheric pressure saw a steady increase throughout the period, indicative of a high-pressure system influencing the weather, typically associated with stable and clearer conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate but increased later in the day, potentially leading to brisk conditions, especially when combined with higher wind speeds and lower humidity. The wind direction was predominantly from the north and northeast but shifted dramatically towards the southeast in the later hours, which could usher in different weather patterns, such as increased moisture or a change in temperature.
