Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable increase in the number of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a peak ratio of positive specimens reaching 26.27% in week 15 from a baseline of 0.62%. The prevalence of Influenza A has been significantly higher than Influenza B throughout the period, with its peak at 26.15% compared to Influenza B's peak at 0.14%. However, the latest data shows a declining trend in the positivity rate, with the current week at 4.59%, suggesting a potential decrease in influenza activity. Despite this recent decrease, the high peak indicates a considerable burden on the healthcare system, likely resulting in increased hospital visits, potential strain on resources, and a need for continued public health vigilance. The consistent but relatively low presence of Influenza B emphasizes the importance of including both A and B virus strains in preventive measures such as vaccinations.
