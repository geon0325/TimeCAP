Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a gradual uptrend, increasing from 3093.08 to 3145.91, signaling a potentially positive outlook for the U.S. equity market. The VIX, commonly known as the "fear index," has decreased slightly from 12.07 to 13.62, indicating reduced market volatility and investor anxiety. In contrast, the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 have experienced fluctuations, with the Nikkei closing slightly lower than its opening, while the FTSE 100 showed more volatility with a downward trend before recovering towards the end of the period. Gold futures have seen a general decline from 1461.30 to 1459.10, suggesting a shift in investor preference towards riskier assets, while crude oil futures have risen from 57.24 to 59.20, which could indicate growing energy demand or geopolitical tensions affecting supply. Exchange rates have held relatively steady, with minor fluctuations in EUR/USD and USD/JPY pairs, and a slight depreciation of the USD against the CNY, from 7.00 to 7.04, potentially reflecting ongoing trade negotiations or shifts in economic policy.
