Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable upward trend in the proportion of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases across all age groups, with the percentage of ILI patients steadily increasing from 1.23% to 4.35%. This surge has led to the ILI ratio exceeding the threshold of 2.9% in the last five weeks, indicating a significant rise in severity. The highest increase in ILI cases has been observed in the 5-24 age group, where the number of patients more than quintupled from 7046 to 38072. The consistent growth in ILI cases, especially in the latter part of the 20-week period, suggests an ongoing and intensifying influenza season, which may lead to increased healthcare resource utilization and potential strain on healthcare services. The data indicates a critical need for public health interventions and increased vigilance in monitoring ILI trends to manage the heightened demand on the healthcare system effectively.
