Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 showed a general upward trend, increasing from 3010.29 to 3108.46, indicative of investor confidence and market strength during this period. However, the VIX, which is a measure of market volatility, remained relatively low with minor fluctuations, suggesting that the upward movement in the stock market was not accompanied by significant investor anxiety. The Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 also displayed upward movements, although the FTSE 100 ended the period with a notable decline, which may suggest regional market variations and investor sentiments. Gold futures experienced some volatility, initially decreasing in value but then stabilizing around the 1473.30 mark, which could be indicative of investors turning to safer assets amidst economic uncertainties. The currency exchange rates against the USD for EUR and JPY remained fairly stable with slight fluctuations, while the CNY saw a minor appreciation against the USD, which could have implications for international trade balances and economic policy decisions.
