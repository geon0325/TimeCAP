Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in mortality due to Influenza or Pneumonia, with a marked peak in the ratio of mortality from these causes to total deaths occurring between weeks 10 and 13, reaching up to 15.78%. This peak correlates with a significant spike in the total number of deaths, suggesting a possible outbreak or heightened seasonality impact during that period. The mortality ratio has since declined, approaching the 20-week average of 7.84%, but still remains above this baseline in the latest week at 7.86%. The absolute number of deaths from Influenza has significantly decreased in recent weeks, indicating a possible seasonal decline or effective control measures. However, the consistently higher mortality ratios compared to the average, and the sustained number of deaths from Pneumonia, require continuous monitoring and potentially increased healthcare resource allocation to manage any ongoing or future surges.
