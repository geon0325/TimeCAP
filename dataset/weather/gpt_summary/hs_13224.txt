Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, indicative of a cooling trend. Humidity levels remained high for the majority of the period, often reaching saturation, which suggests the potential for fog formation or precipitation. Air pressure has been steadily declining, which could be associated with an approaching weather system that may lead to instability in the weather pattern. Wind speeds varied, with occasional gusts, while wind direction shifted from predominantly easterly to northerly, indicating a possible change in weather fronts. The combination of high humidity, lowering air pressure, and changing wind patterns could signal the likelihood of upcoming rain or thunderstorms in the region.
