Over the last 20 weeks, the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza has fluctuated, with an overall average positivity rate of 6.26%. The highest weekly positivity rate observed was 0.40% in week 19, while the lowest was 0.13% in week 12. Influenza A showed a relatively steady presence with its positivity rate ranging from 0.05% to 0.23%, but without any clear trend of increase or decrease over the period. Conversely, Influenza B exhibited more variability, with its weekly positivity rates ranging from 0.05% to 0.22% and peaking in week 19. The data suggests a relatively low and stable circulation of influenza, but the recent peak in week 19 could indicate a potential upcoming increase in influenza activity, which the healthcare system should monitor closely for planning and response purposes.
