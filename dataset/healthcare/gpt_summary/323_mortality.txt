Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths has fluctuated, with a noticeable trend of decrease from an average of 7.84% to values consistently below this average, reaching as low as 5.00% in the most recent week. The absolute number of deaths from both Influenza and Pneumonia has also shown a declining trend, with deaths from Influenza decreasing from 55 to 12, and deaths from Pneumonia dropping from 3840 to 2836 over the 20-week period. Despite a slight variability in weekly mortality ratios, there is a clear downward trend, suggesting an overall improvement in the management or a decrease in the prevalence of these diseases. The total number of deaths has remained relatively stable, with minor fluctuations but no significant long-term trend. This data could indicate effective treatment and prevention strategies for Influenza and Pneumonia, warranting a closer look at public health policies and healthcare practices to identify successful interventions and areas for continued improvement.
