Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable upward trend in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the ratio of positive specimens increasing from 0.28% to 7.99%. This trend is primarily attributed to Influenza A, which showed a substantial rise from 0.22% to 7.91%, indicating its dominant presence over Influenza B in the tested population. Despite fluctuations, Influenza B remained a minor contributor to the overall positivity rate, with its percentage consistently below 0.1%, except in the last week where it reached 0.08%. The peak in positive tests for Influenza A at 7.91% in the latest week suggests a significant surge in infections that could potentially stress the healthcare system with increased hospitalizations and a need for medical resources. This upward trend warrants close monitoring and may necessitate public health interventions to mitigate the spread of the virus.
