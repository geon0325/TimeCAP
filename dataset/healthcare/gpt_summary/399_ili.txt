Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a significant uptrend in the proportion of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases among the total number of patients, with the percentage of ILI cases exceeding the 2.9% benchmark for severity in the latter 13 weeks. The most notable increase was seen in the age group of 5-24, which peaked during the 10th week with 61,015 cases, reflecting the higher transmission rates likely among school-aged children and young adults. The age group 25-49 also showed a substantial rise, peaking at 48,042 cases in the 14th week, highlighting the spread of ILI in the working-age population. Despite the decrease in the last five weeks, the percentage of ILI cases remains above the threshold, with the latest value at 3.06%, suggesting that the healthcare system may still be under strain from ILI. The consistent surpassing of the severity benchmark indicates a sustained ILI activity that warrants continued monitoring and resource allocation within the healthcare system to manage the potential demand for medical care and preventative measures.
