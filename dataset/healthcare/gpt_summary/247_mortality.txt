Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable increase in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, starting at 8.10% and peaking at 18.51%, significantly above the average of 7.84%. This upward trend suggests an alarming rise in the severity or incidence of these respiratory conditions. Interestingly, the absolute number of deaths attributed to influenza has remained relatively low, with a sudden spike in week 15, suggesting a possible outbreak or a reporting anomaly. In contrast, deaths from pneumonia have shown a consistent increase, reaching a maximum in week 14 before gradually declining, yet remaining well above the initial figures. These patterns indicate a potential strain on healthcare resources and highlight the need for focused public health interventions to manage and mitigate the impact of respiratory diseases, especially pneumonia.
