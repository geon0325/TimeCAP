Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, a gradual decline in temperature was observed, reaching its lowest point during the early morning hours before rising again towards the evening, indicative of typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels experienced an increase in the night that persisted into the early morning, suggesting the possibility of morning fog or dew, which is characteristic of San Francisco's microclimate, especially near coastal areas. The air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with a slight increase towards the evening, which could indicate stable weather conditions with a low likelihood of precipitation. Wind speed varied minimally during the initial hours, remaining calm, but increased significantly later on, suggesting a windier evening that could impact outdoor activities and maritime conditions. The wind direction was highly variable, with periods of calm followed by a shift to southerly and easterly winds, which can influence fog dispersion and the distribution of temperatures across the city.
