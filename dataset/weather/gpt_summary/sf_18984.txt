Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperature has remained relatively stable with a slight warming trend observed recently. Humidity levels have been very high, frequently reaching saturation, which could contribute to foggy conditions and potentially affect visibility in the area. Air pressure has been on a gradual decline, suggesting a possible change in weather patterns, such as the approach of a weather front that could lead to precipitation or wind changes. Wind speeds have increased slightly but remained light to moderate throughout the period, and the wind direction has shifted from easterly to southeasterly directions, indicating a change in the local wind pattern. Overall, the high humidity, decreasing air pressure, and shifting winds may be indicative of an incoming weather system that could affect local weather conditions in the near term.
