Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the later hours of the period. Humidity levels showed a decreasing trend during the same time as temperatures rose, suggesting a typical diurnal pattern with drier conditions in the afternoon. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, indicating that there were no significant frontal systems passing through that would disrupt the weather. Wind speeds were consistently light, which would not have contributed much to the dispersion of pollutants or to any significant wind chill effect. Wind direction varied but included a notable shift from southeasterly to westerly and then back to southeasterly, which could be associated with local circulation patterns or passing weather systems.
