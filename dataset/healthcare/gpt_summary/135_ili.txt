Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a notable upward trend in the incidence of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) across all age groups. The most significant increases in ILI cases have been observed in the youngest (0-4 years) and school-age (5-24 years) populations, which may suggest heightened transmission in settings such as daycare centers and schools. The ratio of ILI patients to total patients has recently surpassed the baseline threshold, indicating a potential onset of an influenza outbreak. This upward trajectory, particularly in the most recent weeks, suggests an escalation that could strain healthcare resources if the trend continues. Public health interventions and increased healthcare preparedness may be necessary to address the growing number of ILI cases and prevent a significant impact on the healthcare system.
