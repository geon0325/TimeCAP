Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in the mortality ratio of Influenza or Pneumonia when compared to the total number of deaths. The highest ratio was observed in the first week at 10.56%, with a peak of 10.72% in the thirteenth week, both exceeding the average ratio of 7.84% significantly. However, the latest data shows a ratio of 8.16%, indicating a marginal increase from the preceding week's 8.01%, but still above the average. The total number of deaths from all causes started at 64,399 and ended at 60,506, showing a moderate decrease, while deaths from Influenza have declined over the period, suggesting a declining impact or effective control measures against the flu. Pneumonia deaths started at 6,779 and ended at 4,933, demonstrating a decreasing trend, though they still contribute substantially to the overall mortality from these conditions, which could indicate a need for ongoing focus on pneumonia prevention and treatment within healthcare policies.
