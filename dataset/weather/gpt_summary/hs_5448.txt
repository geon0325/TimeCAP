In the last 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual increase in temperature reaching its peak during the afternoon, before slowly tapering off towards the evening. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with a notable peak in the early morning hours which is typically indicative of a muggy start to the day, followed by a decrease as temperatures rose, and a moderate increase again during the night. Air pressure showed a steady decline throughout the period, suggesting a potential weather system moving into the area, which can often be associated with changing weather patterns or the arrival of a front. Wind speeds were mostly consistent but did show temporary lulls, particularly around midday. The wind direction was predominantly from the south, with a brief shift to northerly and easterly directions in the middle of the day, before returning to a southerly flow which could influence moisture transport and potentially affect precipitation patterns.
