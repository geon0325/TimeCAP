Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a slight decrease in temperature, indicating a subtle cooling trend. The humidity levels have remained consistently high, which could contribute to a muggy and uncomfortable atmosphere for residents. Air pressure showed a marginal downward trend, which could suggest an approaching weather system or front. Wind speeds gradually increased throughout the day, potentially leading to a breezier condition, while the wind direction shifted from a northeasterly to a northerly direction, which may influence local weather patterns such as the distribution of cloud cover and precipitation areas. Overall, the combination of high humidity, increasing wind speeds, and the slight drop in air pressure could be indicative of changing weather conditions in the near future.
