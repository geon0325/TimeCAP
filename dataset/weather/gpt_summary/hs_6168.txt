Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a modest fluctuation in temperature with a general trend of warming during the day and cooling towards the evening. Humidity levels remained high throughout the period, although they showed a slight decrease during the hottest part of the day, potentially providing some relief from the mugginess. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a minor decreasing trend, which could be indicative of stable weather conditions in the short term. Wind speeds were light and variable, with no significant gusts, suggesting calm weather conditions without significant wind-related impacts. The wind direction shifted throughout the day, primarily coming from the south-southeast and then varying towards a more northerly and easterly direction, which could influence humidity and temperature patterns in the area due to the change in air masses.
