Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, moving from below freezing to slightly above freezing conditions. The humidity levels showed significant fluctuation, with notable peaks suggesting the possibility of transient fog or mist formation during periods of high humidity. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase, indicating a period of stable weather conditions without the immediate approach of a significant weather front. Wind speeds were moderate and decreased over time, with occasional variations in speed, which could affect wind chill, making it feel colder than the actual temperature. Wind direction was predominantly from the northwest, shifting slightly throughout the day, which is typical for the region and may have contributed to the gradual temperature rise as winds shifted to a more westerly direction.
