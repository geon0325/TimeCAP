Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a slight upward trend in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia relative to total deaths, increasing from an initial 5.70% to 6.47%, which exceeds the 20-week average of 7.84%. The total number of deaths has also risen, from 56,251 to 60,078, with a notable jump in the final two weeks. Deaths specifically from pneumonia have shown an increasing trend, from 3,178 to 3,831, suggesting a growing impact of respiratory illnesses on overall mortality. In contrast, deaths from influenza have remained relatively low and stable, with a slight increase in the last two weeks, reaching 57 from a low of 16. This overall rise in pneumonia-related mortality could indicate a need for heightened healthcare resources to manage respiratory illnesses and prevent further escalation.
