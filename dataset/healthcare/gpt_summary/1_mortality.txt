Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable decline in the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia relative to the total number of deaths, from an initial 7.99% to a final 6.11%, indicating a downward trend below the 20-week average of 7.84%. The total number of deaths has also decreased from 60,980 to 50,972 during the period. Deaths attributable to influenza showed a significant drop from 368 to 24, while deaths from pneumonia decreased from 4,505 to 3,091. The consistent decline in the ratio suggests improvements in the prevention, management, or treatment of these respiratory conditions. However, the persistent incidence of deaths from these causes still poses challenges for healthcare systems in terms of resource allocation and the management of seasonal outbreaks.
