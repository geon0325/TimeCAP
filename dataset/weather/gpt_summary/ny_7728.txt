Over the last 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching a peak in the late afternoon before a slight decrease towards the evening. Humidity levels started relatively moderate but rose significantly overnight, with a subsequent decrease towards the afternoon, indicating a potential for morning condensation followed by drier conditions later in the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable initially but saw a slight downward trend, which could suggest an approaching weather system that may affect the city's weather patterns. Wind speeds were consistent and light throughout the period, with no significant gusts that would impact the urban environment severely. The wind direction shifted from easterly in the early hours to more of a westerly direction by the end of the period, which could influence the movement of weather systems across the region and potentially bring changes in weather conditions.
