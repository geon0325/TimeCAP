Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced stable and high humidity levels, indicative of potential fog or mist conditions, particularly affecting visibility and likely resulting in a very damp atmosphere. Temperatures have remained relatively constant with only slight fluctuations, suggesting a lack of significant heating or cooling trends, which is typical for the maritime climate of the region. Air pressure has been rising steadily, a sign that indicates improving weather conditions and the likely presence of a high-pressure system moving into the area. Wind speeds have been low to moderate throughout the period, with little variation, pointing towards calm to gentle breezes that might not have a substantial impact on day-to-day activities. The wind direction has varied but predominantly stayed within the southern quadrant, which could be associated with the transportation of relatively milder air masses from the south.
