Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 experienced volatility with a general downtrend, closing lower at 4462.21 from an initial 4511.61, reflecting investor uncertainty. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, remained elevated throughout this period, starting at 22.94 and ending at 21.37, which indicates a persistently cautious market sentiment. The Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 also showed fluctuations, with the Nikkei closing lower suggesting concerns in the Asian markets, while the FTSE 100 displayed relative resilience ending slightly above its starting point.

Commodity prices such as Gold Futures and Crude Oil Futures saw mixed trends; Gold Futures had an uptrend signaling a flight to safety, while Crude Oil Futures decreased from 111.76 to 102.56, possibly due to demand concerns. Currency exchange rates experienced a slight depreciation of the Euro and the Japanese Yen against the US Dollar, which might impact international trade dynamics and reflect a stronger USD.
