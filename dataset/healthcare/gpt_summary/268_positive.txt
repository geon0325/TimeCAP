During the last 20 weeks, the overall ratio of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza has hovered below the average ratio of 6.26%, with a decreasing trend in positive cases observed towards the end of the period. The highest percentage of positive specimens occurred in week 4 (0.29%), while the lowest occurred in week 19 (0.07%). Influenza B has consistently shown higher positivity rates than Influenza A, reaching its peak in week 4 at 0.20% and declining to 0.04% by week 20. The peak for Influenza A was 0.09% in weeks 4 and 5, which then reduced to a low of 0.03% in the final week. This overall downward trend in influenza cases suggests a decrease in the influenza activity, which might relieve some pressure on the healthcare system but remains essential to monitor for any potential resurgence.
