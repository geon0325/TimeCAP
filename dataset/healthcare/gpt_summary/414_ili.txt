Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a decreasing trend in the incidence of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) across all age groups. The proportion of ILI cases peaked at the beginning of the time series, with the ratio of ILI patients at 6.46%, well above the 2.9% threshold for severity, and has since steadily declined to below the benchmark, reaching 1.97% in the most recent week. This decline is consistent across all age groups, with the highest number of cases initially found in the 5-24 age group, suggesting that this demographic might have been driving the epidemic. Notably, the older population (age 65 or more) has shown a slower decrease in ILI cases compared to other age groups, which could indicate a sustained vulnerability in this demographic. The current data suggest that the healthcare system may be experiencing relief from the high volumes of ILI cases seen earlier, but continued monitoring is necessary to manage and respond to the needs of the at-risk elderly population.
