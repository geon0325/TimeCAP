Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in San Francisco have shown a typical diurnal cycle, starting cooler in the early hours, warming significantly through the day, and cooling again towards the evening. Relative humidity has varied inversely with temperature, as expected, reaching its peak during the coolest parts of the day and dropping as temperatures rose. Atmospheric pressure has remained relatively stable, with a slight downward trend in the most recent hours, which could indicate an approaching change in weather patterns. Wind speeds have been mostly light to moderate, with a period of calm winds, and the wind direction has been variable, shifting throughout the day, which is characteristic of a coastal city with complex topography. The combination of these factors suggests a stable weather pattern, but the slight decrease in pressure may need to be monitored for any potential incoming systems that could alter the current conditions.
