Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a fluctuating but generally decreasing trend in the positivity ratio for both Influenza A and B, with overall positive specimen ratios dropping from a high of 0.29% to a low of 0.07%. Despite this decline, the average positivity ratio of 6.26% suggests that there have been periods with significantly higher influenza activity within the sampled timeframe. Influenza B has been more prevalent than Influenza A throughout the period, often contributing to a larger proportion of the positive cases, although both subtypes have seen a decrease in detection rates. The number of specimens tested remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, ensuring a consistent sample size for analysis. These trends are important for healthcare resource planning, indicating a possible reduction in influenza cases that could alleviate the burden on healthcare facilities but also necessitating vigilance for potential resurgences.
