Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature with a slight dip during the early morning hours before rising again, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels showed moderate fluctuation but overall maintained a steady average, suggesting relatively stable atmospheric moisture content. Air pressure remained high and fairly constant throughout the period, with a slight downward trend observed towards the end, which could be indicative of a changing weather system approaching. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, increasing as the day progressed, and the predominant wind direction shifted from northerly in the early hours to more southeasterly by the end of the period, possibly bringing in more moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. These conditions suggest a stable weather pattern for Houston, though the slight pressure decrease and increasing wind speed may hint at potential changes on the horizon.
