Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has experienced a notable diurnal variation, starting off cooler in the early hours, reaching a peak in the late afternoon before falling again towards the evening. Humidity levels have shown a decreasing trend through the day, which is typical as temperatures rise, indicating drier conditions towards the afternoon. Air pressure has been steadily decreasing, a sign that could point towards changing weather patterns, potentially signaling an approaching weather system. Wind speeds have been generally light but increased slightly towards the end of the period, which, combined with the changing air pressure, may suggest the likelihood of changing weather conditions. The wind direction has been variable, although predominantly from the south, which in Houston can often contribute to warmer and more humid conditions due to the Gulf of Mexico's influence.
