Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, with the coolest conditions observed in the early morning hours before a modest warming trend later in the day. Humidity levels have shown fluctuations, starting high, decreasing during midday, and increasing again towards the evening, which could have contributed to variable comfort levels throughout the day. Air pressure was relatively stable at first but saw a significant drop towards the end of the period, which may indicate the approach of a weather system that could lead to changing weather conditions. Wind speeds varied, with several periods of increased wind activity, particularly during the morning hours, which might have resulted in cooler perceived temperatures and windier conditions. Wind direction was predominantly from the west and northwest, with a brief shift to easterly winds, before returning to westerly directions, consistent with the maritime influence on San Francisco's weather.
