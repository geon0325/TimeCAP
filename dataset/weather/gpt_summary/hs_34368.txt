Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a gradual increase in temperature reaching its peak in the late afternoon before showing a slight decline towards the evening. Relative humidity experienced a significant drop during the day, which is typical as temperatures rise, but it remained high during the early hours, indicative of muggy conditions likely causing discomfort. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with a minor fluctuation that is not indicative of any immediate, significant weather changes. Wind speeds varied mildly and increased slightly during the day, suggesting a breezy condition that may have provided some relief from the heat. The wind direction was variable but predominantly from the east to northeast, with a notable shift to southerly and westerly directions in the early morning, which could have implications for local weather patterns such as moisture transport and temperature variation.
