Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature with a general warming trend toward the latter part of the day. Humidity levels were high throughout most of the period, with a peak around the middle of the day and a noticeable decrease later on, possibly indicating the passage of a front or a change in air masses. Air pressure has shown a gradual decrease, suggesting an approach of a low-pressure system which could lead to changing weather conditions or increased chances of precipitation. Wind speeds increased significantly in the latter half of the period, with the strongest winds occurring later in the day, which could contribute to more dynamic weather patterns. Wind direction remained predominantly from the south to southeast, consistent with warm, moist air being drawn into the region, which is typical for Houston's climate.
