Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have exhibited a slight decreasing trend, indicating a mild cooling period, particularly noticeable during the night hours. Humidity levels have varied, reaching saturation at one point, which could have led to foggy conditions or dew; however, a subsequent significant drop in humidity may suggest a drying atmosphere. Barometric pressure has steadily increased, suggesting stable and possibly improving weather conditions. Wind speeds have been mostly light but increased in the later hours, while wind direction has seen notable shifts, transitioning from southeasterly to northerly, which could be indicative of a frontal passage through the area. These combined atmospheric conditions point toward a stable weather pattern with a potential for clearer skies following the period of high humidity.
