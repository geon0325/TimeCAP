Over the last 24 hours in New York City, there has been a slight fluctuation in temperature, showing a general warming trend during the day followed by a subtle cooling trend towards the evening. Humidity levels started moderately high and saw a peak, then decreased noticeably, indicating a period of drier air moving into the area. Air pressure has been relatively stable with a slight overall decrease, suggesting a stable weather pattern but with the potential for changes if the trend continues. Wind speeds have been consistently light, with very little variation, which would have a minimal impact on dispersing air pollutants and could lead to a feeling of stagnation in the air. The wind direction has shifted from westerly to northerly and then to easterly, which could bring in different air masses, potentially affecting the local weather conditions further.
