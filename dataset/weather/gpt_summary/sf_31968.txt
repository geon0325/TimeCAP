Over the past day in San Francisco, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature, with a warming trend in the afternoon hours followed by a slight cooling trend towards the late evening. Relative humidity levels have seen significant variation, starting very high, dropping markedly during the day, and then increasing again towards the evening, indicating potential fog development, especially in the early morning hours. Air pressure experienced a period of stability for most of the day but showed a sudden drop, which could be indicative of an approaching weather system that may affect the local conditions. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate throughout the day but increased significantly in the last recorded hour, suggesting the onset of gustier conditions which could impact outdoor activities and maritime operations. The wind direction has been variable, shifting from northerly to westerly and back, with a tendency towards northwesterly in the most recent hours, which is typical for the region and may bring cooler, oceanic air inland.
