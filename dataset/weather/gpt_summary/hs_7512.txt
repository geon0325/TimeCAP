Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, indicating cooler weather moving into the region. The relative humidity has shown variability, with a notable increase during the cooler early hours, which is typical as cooler air can hold less moisture. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase towards the latter part of the period, which could suggest the approach or presence of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a peak suggesting a brief period of gustier conditions. The wind direction was predominantly from the southeast, shifting to northerly and then easterly, which could influence local weather patterns by bringing in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico or cooler air from the north.
