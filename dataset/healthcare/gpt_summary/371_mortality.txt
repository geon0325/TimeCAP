Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia as a percentage of total deaths has fluctuated, with a general downward trend from an initial 7.20% to a low of 5.70%, before rising again to 6.86% in the most recent week. The average ratio of mortality from these causes over the period is below the historical average of 7.84%, suggesting a relative decrease in the proportion of deaths attributable to Influenza or Pneumonia. The absolute number of deaths from both causes combined has decreased from 4347 in the first week to 4247 in the 20th week, despite the total number of deaths increasing from 60336 to 61930 in the same interval. This indicates that while overall mortality has risen, the contribution of Influenza or Pneumonia to this increase is not proportionate. Healthcare systems may interpret this data as a positive indication of the effectiveness of current interventions against these respiratory diseases, but should remain vigilant due to the recent uptick in their mortality ratio.
