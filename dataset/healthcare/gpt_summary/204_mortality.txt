Over the past 20 weeks, the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia to total deaths has demonstrated significant fluctuations, peaking at 19.37% and 19.40% during the 5th and 6th weeks, respectively, which is substantially higher than the average ratio of 7.84%. These peaks coincide with a sharp increase in total deaths, suggesting a potential outbreak or a seasonal surge. Following this spike, there has been a consistent decline in both the absolute number of deaths from Influenza or Pneumonia and their proportion relative to total deaths, with the latest reported ratio being 8.54%, which is slightly above the average but much lower than the peak values. The number of deaths from Influenza alone remains comparatively low with a downward trend, indicating that Pneumonia is the primary contributor to the fluctuations in mortality. Monitoring these trends is critical for healthcare resource allocation and for assessing the effectiveness of public health interventions aimed at reducing respiratory illness-related mortality.
