Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with an initial decline followed by a recovery, ending slightly higher than the starting point. The VIX, which measures market volatility, reflects this with an increase to mid-20s before settling back down to just above the starting level, suggesting that while there was a period of heightened uncertainty, it has somewhat stabilized. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 also experienced fluctuations with the FTSE showing a more pronounced drop before a recovery, while the Nikkei depicted a gradual decline overall. Gold futures have risen, indicating a possible shift towards safe-haven assets amidst market uncertainties, while crude oil futures saw a decrease, potentially signaling lower demand or oversupply concerns. Currency exchange rates reveal a weakening US dollar against the Euro and Japanese Yen, but a relatively stable performance against the Chinese Yuan, which could impact international trade dynamics and foreign investment flows.
