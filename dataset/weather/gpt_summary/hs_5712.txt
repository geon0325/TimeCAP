Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has shown a pattern of fluctuation, with a noticeable increase during the daylight hours followed by a decrease after sunset, consistent with diurnal variation. The humidity levels have experienced significant variation, reaching saturation overnight which likely indicates the presence of fog or dew, but decreasing notably during the day, which could have implications for comfort levels and heat perception. Air pressure has been relatively stable, with a slight overall downward trend, which may suggest the distant approach of a weather system. Wind speed has varied moderately, with an increase towards the current hour, potentially affecting outdoor activities and increasing the wind chill effect during cooler parts of the day. The prevailing wind direction has been predominantly from the south to southeast, which is typical for Houston and can contribute to the transport of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico into the area, affecting humidity and precipitation patterns.
