Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a gradual increase in temperature, reaching a peak in the late afternoon before starting to cool down slightly during the evening hours. Humidity levels showed a marked decrease as temperatures rose, indicating an inverse relationship typical of diurnal patterns. Air pressure remained relatively stable with slight fluctuations, but there was an overall decreasing trend, which may suggest an approaching weather system. Wind speeds varied moderately throughout the day, with an increase observed during the afternoon, which could have contributed to the dispersal of humidity and a more comfortable feel in the air. The predominant wind direction was from the northeast, shifting to a northerly direction at times, which is consistent with the passage of a frontal system.
