Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have shown a gradual increase, consistent with the diurnal cycle, reaching their peak in the late afternoon before starting to decline slightly towards the evening. Humidity levels have been high throughout the period, indicative of a saturated atmosphere, which could suggest the potential for fog formation or precipitation if other conditions, such as lifting mechanisms, are present. Atmospheric pressure has remained relatively stable, with a slight decrease noted towards the end of the period, which could indicate an approaching weather system or frontal boundary. Wind speeds have been mostly light but have shown an increasing trend, possibly affecting the dispersion of any atmospheric pollutants and impacting the thermal comfort level. The wind direction has shifted from easterly to southeasterly, which could be associated with the transport of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, potentially influencing local weather conditions such as cloud cover or humidity levels.
