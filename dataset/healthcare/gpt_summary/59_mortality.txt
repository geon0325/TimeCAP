Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable decline in both the number of deaths attributed to influenza and pneumonia, as well as their combined ratio to the total number of deaths, which started at 9.20% and decreased to 5.38%. The total number of deaths from all causes has fluctuated slightly but remained relatively stable, with a minor decrease towards the later weeks. The greatest week-to-week percentage drop in influenza deaths occurred early in the period, while pneumonia deaths have consistently decreased over time. Despite this decline, the mortality ratio from influenza or pneumonia remained above the average ratio of 7.84% for the initial nine weeks, before falling below this threshold for the remainder of the period. This trend suggests a relative improvement in managing these respiratory conditions, which could indicate a seasonal decline in cases or improved healthcare interventions, but continued monitoring is necessary to understand the long-term implications for the healthcare system.
