Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced relatively stable, cold temperatures that dipped slightly below average during the early hours. Humidity levels varied but showed a general increase towards the end of the period, indicating a higher likelihood of precipitation or fog as the air reached saturation point. The air pressure remained high and steady, which typically suggests continued fair weather, although the slight decrease in pressure later on could signal an approaching weather system. Wind speeds were mostly light with a significant shift in direction, transitioning from predominantly northwest to coming from the south, which could bring warmer air masses and possibly affect the temperature in the following hours. The combination of these factors points to stable but chilly weather conditions, with a chance of increasing moisture that might result in morning fog or dew.
