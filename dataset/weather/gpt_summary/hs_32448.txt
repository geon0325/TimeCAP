Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a gradual increase in temperature, reaching a peak in the afternoon before showing a slight decrease towards the evening. Humidity levels experienced a noticeable drop during the day, suggesting the presence of drier air moving into the area. Air pressure remained relatively stable but saw a significant increase at one point, which could indicate the passing of a frontal system. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate and consistent throughout the period, with minor fluctuations. The wind direction was predominantly from the south to south-southeast, which is typical for Houston and can contribute to the transport of warmer air from the Gulf of Mexico into the region.
