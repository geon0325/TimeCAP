Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a fluctuating trend of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) across different age groups, with a notable uptick in the percentage of ILI patients that reached its peak around the mid-point of the observed period. The age group of 5-24 years consistently showed the highest number of ILI cases, suggesting a significant transmission rate in this demographic, potentially reflecting social behavior or immune susceptibility. Notably, the eldest age group (65 or more) maintained the lowest number of ILI cases, yet the implications of ILI in this population are critical due to the potential for severe complications. After reaching a peak, the ratio of ILI patients has shown a decline towards the end of the period, falling below the baseline threshold, which may indicate a tapering off of the ILI season or the effectiveness of public health interventions. However, healthcare systems must continue monitoring these trends closely as ILI activity remains dynamic and can impose varying degrees of burden on healthcare resources.
