Over the past 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown significant volatility, with a notable drop to 3900.79 from a high of 4300.17, reflecting increased market uncertainty. The VIX, or Volatility Index, has correspondingly risen, peaking at 34.75, which indicates heightened investor fear. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have also experienced declines, although the FTSE 100's drop has been less severe, signaling potentially greater resilience or different market dynamics in the UK. Gold Futures have seen a downward trend to 1841.20, indicating a potential flight to safety among investors, while Crude Oil Futures have remained relatively high, with fluctuations suggesting ongoing concerns around supply and geopolitical tensions. Exchange rates have seen the USD strengthening against both the Euro and the Japanese Yen, but slightly weakening against the Chinese Yuan, suggesting a complex interplay of currency values based on differing economic conditions and market sentiments.
