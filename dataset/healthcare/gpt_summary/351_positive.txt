Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a significant increase in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a rise from 1.27% to 14.94%. This upward trend is primarily driven by Influenza A, which grew from 1.21% to 14.81% of specimens, indicating that it is the predominant strain in circulation. Despite a lower prevalence, Influenza B also showed a slight increase in the ratio of positive specimens, though its overall impact remains much smaller compared to Influenza A. The peak testing week saw 144,126 specimens, nearly double the number at the start of the time series, reflecting heightened surveillance and possibly increased incidence of influenza-like illness. The substantial growth in positive cases, particularly Influenza A, suggests an ongoing influenza season that could place additional strain on healthcare resources, necessitating preparedness for increased hospitalizations and demand for antiviral treatments.
