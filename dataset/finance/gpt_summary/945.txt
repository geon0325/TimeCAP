Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 demonstrated a volatile but overall upward trend, closing higher by 6.05% from its starting point, which indicates a potential return of investor confidence after initial losses. The VIX, also known as the fear gauge, showed a downward trend, closing at 25.75, a 14.52% decrease from its initial value, suggesting reduced market uncertainty and increased stability. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 exhibited mixed performances, with the Nikkei decreasing by 4.21% and the FTSE 100 slightly rising by 2%, possibly reflecting regional economic sentiments and the influence of global market dynamics.

Commodity prices had divergent paths, with Gold Futures declining by 3.15%, which might be due to investors moving towards riskier assets, while Crude Oil Futures saw a slight increase of 5.11%, potentially indicating concerns over supply or geopolitical tensions. Lastly, currency exchange rates saw the EUR/USD pair fluctuating but ending flat, while the USD/JPY and USD/CNY pairs both showed a strengthening of the Japanese Yen and Chinese Yuan against the US Dollar by 2.78% and 1.25% respectively, hinting at potential shifts in currency markets that could impact international trade and investment flows.
