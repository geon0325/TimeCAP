Over the past day, Houston experienced a gradual rise in temperature, peaking during the afternoon hours before a slight decline towards the evening, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels were high throughout the period, often reaching saturation, suggesting a likelihood of fog or dew formation, especially during early morning hours when temperatures were lower. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase midday, which could be associated with fair weather conditions during that time. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with some variability in speed, but no significant gusts or strong winds were observed. The wind direction varied, primarily coming from the south-southeast, which is typical for Houston and could contribute to the area's humidity by bringing in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico.
