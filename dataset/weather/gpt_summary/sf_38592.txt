Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, reaching its lowest point in the early hours before gradually rising again towards the evening. The relative humidity showed significant fluctuations, with notably high levels during the night that decreased drastically towards the late evening, suggesting the possibility of morning fog that cleared later in the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable with slight variations, although there was a significant increase in the late evening, which could indicate a transient high-pressure system moving into the area. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a peak in the evening, which might have contributed to the dispersal of any coastal fog or low-lying clouds. The wind direction varied widely, with shifts from northwesterly to northeasterly and then to westerly directions, indicating the passage of a weather front and the influence of varying local geographical features on the wind patterns.
