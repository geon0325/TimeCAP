Over the last 20 weeks, there has been notable fluctuation in the incidence of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) across different age groups. Initially, the ratio of ILI patients was below the baseline but experienced a significant increase, peaking midway through the period, particularly in the 25-49 age group, which saw the most substantial rise. This was followed by a decline that brought the ILI ratio back below the baseline. The data suggests that the healthcare system may have faced increased pressure during the peak period, especially due to a higher burden of ILI cases in adults. However, recent trends indicate a decrease in ILI prevalence, potentially easing the strain on healthcare resources.
