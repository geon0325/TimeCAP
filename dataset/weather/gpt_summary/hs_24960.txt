Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have experienced a gradual increase, indicating a warming trend that peaked during the late afternoon hours before slightly decreasing towards the evening. Humidity levels have shown an inverse relationship with temperature, starting high in the cooler early hours and then dropping significantly as the day warmed up, likely contributing to a decrease in the perceived comfort level. Air pressure remained relatively stable with only minor fluctuations, which suggests that there were no significant frontal changes affecting the area. Wind speeds varied modestly throughout the day, with a period of calmer conditions around sunrise; however, they increased again later in the day, which could have helped to disperse humidity and moderate the temperature rise. The wind direction was predominantly from the south, with a slight shift to more southwesterly directions later in the day, which is typical for bringing warmer air into the region.
