Over the past 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a general uptrend, increasing from 2881.19 to 3112.35, indicating a growing investor confidence or a rebound in market conditions. In contrast, the VIX, which measures market volatility, has trended downwards from 31.44 to 25.81, suggesting that investors are perceiving less risk in the market. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 have also exhibited upward movements, reinforcing the global nature of the current market recovery. Gold futures have fluctuated but ended slightly lower at 1718.90 compared to 1721.80, which could indicate a shift from safe-haven assets to riskier investments. The crude oil futures have shown a consistent increase from 23.55 to 37.41, likely reflecting optimism about future economic activity and potential concerns over supply constraints, while currency exchange rates have remained relatively stable with minor appreciation of the EUR and JPY against the USD.
