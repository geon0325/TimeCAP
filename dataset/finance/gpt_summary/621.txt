Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with a general downward trend, closing with a loss from 4224.79 to 4258.49. The VIX, which measures market volatility, has increased from 17.89 to 22.50, indicating heightened investor uncertainty and potential market stress. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 both reflected this downward trend in equities, with the Nikkei 225 dropping from 28010.93 to 27652.74 and the FTSE 100 from 7062.30 to 6844.40, which may suggest a global risk-off sentiment. Gold futures remained relatively stable with a slight uptrend from 1781.80 to 1808.70, possibly benefiting from its safe-haven status amid market fluctuations. Crude oil futures experienced a significant drop from 73.66 to 66.42, which could suggest a bearish outlook on global economic activity or a response to oversupply concerns.
