Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a gradual increase in the ratio of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) patients, surpassing the baseline threshold of 2.9% in recent weeks. This upward trend is consistent across all age groups, with a particularly notable surge in ILI incidence among individuals aged 5-24, which could be reflective of transmission dynamics related to school and community activities. The sustained rise in ILI cases has the potential to place additional strain on healthcare resources, necessitating increased vigilance and possible reinforcement of infectious disease protocols. The elderly population (aged 65 or more) has shown a steady rise in ILI cases, which is concerning given their vulnerability to complications, thereby underscoring the need for targeted interventions in this demographic. As ILI activity continues to escalate, public health authorities may need to consider implementing measures such as vaccination campaigns, public awareness initiatives, and resource allocation to manage the impact on the healthcare system.
