Over the last 20 weeks, the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia to the total number of deaths has shown a significant fluctuation, beginning at 16.83%, dipping to a low of 8.10%, and reaching a high of 18.51% in the penultimate week, before decreasing to 15.06% in the last week. The total number of deaths peaked at 86858 in week 19, while the lowest was recorded at 59712 in week 6, indicating a possible seasonal variation or other factors affecting mortality rates. Deaths from pneumonia have consistently made up the bulk of the Influenza or Pneumonia category, with a notable increase from week 6 onwards, aligning with the rise in the total number of deaths. A dramatic spike in influenza deaths is observed in the last week, jumping from 43 to 187, which warrants immediate investigation as it could signal an emerging public health concern. The overall trend suggests a rising impact of Influenza or Pneumonia on mortality rates over the period, which may strain healthcare resources and highlights the need for preventative measures, such as vaccination campaigns and public health interventions.
