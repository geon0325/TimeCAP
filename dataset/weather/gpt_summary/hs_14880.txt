Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures experienced a moderate fluctuation with a warming trend during the day, followed by a slight cooling trend at night. Humidity levels varied significantly, starting moderately before increasing substantially, indicative of a more muggy atmosphere which then slightly lessened towards the current hour. Air pressure showed some variability with a notable increase during the earlier hours, suggesting a possible transient high-pressure system moving through the area, which could have influenced clearer skies and calmer weather conditions temporarily. Wind speeds remained generally light with occasional gentle breezes, and wind directions were predominantly from the south, shifting slightly to the south-southeast and back, which is typical for Houston and can contribute to bringing in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. The combination of these conditions, particularly the high humidity and southerly winds, may lead to a likelihood of cloud formation and potential for precipitation in the near future.
