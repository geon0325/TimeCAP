Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual decline in temperature before a subsequent increase later in the day, which is indicative of a typical diurnal pattern. Humidity levels showed an inverse relationship with temperature, peaking during the cooler early morning hours and decreasing as temperatures rose, which suggests a stable pattern of moisture in the air. The air pressure remained relatively steady with minor fluctuations, indicating a period of stable weather conditions without the presence of significant frontal systems. Wind speeds were generally low, contributing to a calm atmospheric state, but a slight increase in wind speed towards the end of the period could signal a change in the weather pattern. The wind direction was predominantly from the south-southeast, which is common for Houston and can contribute to the transport of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico into the area.
