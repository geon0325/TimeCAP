The analysis of the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data over the last 20 weeks shows a gradual increase in the percentage of ILI patients across all age groups. Initially, the ratio of ILI patients was well below the baseline threshold, indicating a relatively stable situation. As the weeks progressed, there was a consistent uptick in ILI cases, with the most significant increases observed in the youngest (0-4 years) and the school-age (5-24 years) groups. In recent weeks, the ratio of ILI patients has surpassed the baseline, suggesting a potential escalation in influenza activity that could strain healthcare resources if the trend continues. Healthcare providers should be vigilant and prepared for a possible influx of ILI cases, and public health interventions may be necessary to mitigate the spread of influenza.
