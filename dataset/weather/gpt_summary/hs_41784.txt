Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual increase in temperature throughout the day, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before slowly declining towards the evening, indicating typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels were notably high overnight and into the early morning hours, hitting saturation at one point, which could have led to morning fog or dew; however, as temperatures rose, relative humidity decreased, suggesting more comfortable conditions later in the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable with only slight fluctuations, staying within a narrow range indicative of settled weather without any significant frontal systems affecting the area. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate and showed no extreme variations, which is typical for the region and unlikely to have driven any significant weather changes. The wind direction varied throughout the day but predominantly came from the south to southeast, which could have contributed to the warm temperatures and moisture levels observed in Houston, as this direction is often associated with warm, humid air from the Gulf of Mexico.
