Over the past 20 weeks, the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza has consistently remained below the 20-week average of 6.26%, with the highest recorded weekly ratio reaching 0.39% in week 4. While the total number of specimens tested has fluctuated, peaking at 42,526 in week 12, the number of positive cases for both Influenza A and B has not shown a corresponding increase, suggesting a stable or decreasing prevalence of influenza. Influenza B has been more prevalent than Influenza A throughout the period, with the ratio of positive specimens for Influenza B reaching a peak of 0.21% in week 17, compared to a peak of 0.20% for Influenza A in week 4. The declining ratio of positive specimens in recent weeks, down to 0.17% in week 20, indicates a downward trend in influenza cases. This trend may suggest a reduced burden on healthcare resources related to influenza, although continuous monitoring is essential to anticipate and manage potential fluctuations in infection rates.
