Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature followed by a notable increase, indicating a typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels started moderately high and increased to very high levels during the early hours, before decreasing significantly towards the end of the period, which could have influenced the comfort levels and visibility in the area. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with a slight increase and then decrease, suggesting stable weather conditions without significant fronts or storms.
