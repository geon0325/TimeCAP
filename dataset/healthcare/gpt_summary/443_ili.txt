Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a consistent increase in the proportion of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases across all age groups, with the most significant rise observed in the youngest (0-4 years) and school-age (5-24 years) populations. The ILI ratio has steadily grown from 1.29% to 3.57%, surpassing the 2.9% severity benchmark in the last three weeks of the time-series data, indicating a notable uptick in ILI activity. The age group data reveal that the highest absolute increase in ILI cases has occurred in the 0-4 and 5-24 year demographics, suggesting that these age groups could be primary drivers of the current ILI trend. The rise in ILI case ratios suggests that healthcare resources may become increasingly strained, potentially necessitating additional measures to manage patient load and prevent further spread. The data indicates a need for heightened public health vigilance and possible interventions such as vaccination drives, public awareness campaigns, and resource allocation to manage the escalating ILI situation.
