Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature followed by a slight decrease, suggesting a warming trend with a potential peak during the later hours. Humidity levels varied significantly but generally showed a decreasing trend, which could be indicative of less moisture in the air leading to clearer conditions. There has been a remarkable surge in air pressure which is consistent with the arrival of a high-pressure system, potentially leading to more stable weather conditions. Wind speeds remained relatively calm and consistent throughout the period, indicating no significant weather disturbances. The wind direction was predominantly from the south-west to the south, which may have contributed to the warmer temperatures observed due to warmer air being drawn from those directions.
