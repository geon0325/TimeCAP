Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures exhibited a notable upward trend, starting from relatively mild conditions and peaking during the late afternoon hours, indicative of typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels showed a significant fluctuation, with very high humidity in the early morning hours, which then dropped substantially towards the latter part of the day, suggesting the presence of morning dew or fog clearing as daytime heating intensified. Air pressure experienced a gradual decrease, which could be associated with an approaching weather system that might lead to changing weather conditions in the near future. Wind speeds remained mostly light and variable throughout the period, with occasional calm conditions, which would have contributed to a sense of stillness and potentially allowed fog or pollution to accumulate due to the lack of dispersion. Wind directions were predominantly from the north and east, but with significant variability, further indicating the absence of a strong prevailing weather system influencing the region.
