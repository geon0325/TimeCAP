The data over the last 20 weeks indicates a sustained increase in the number of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases across all age groups, with the highest percentage increase observed in the 5-24 age bracket. After an initial period of growth below the 2.9% baseline, there was a sharp escalation where ILI patient ratios consistently exceeded the threshold, peaking in the middle of the observed period. However, in the most recent weeks, there has been a notable decline in ILI ratios, suggesting a possible easing of the ILI incidence. The marked increase in ILI cases, particularly among the younger and middle-aged populations, likely placed additional pressure on healthcare resources, necessitating increased vigilance and potential scaling of healthcare services. With the recent downtrend in ILI ratios, healthcare systems may experience some relief, but continued monitoring is essential to manage resources effectively and prepare for potential future surges.
