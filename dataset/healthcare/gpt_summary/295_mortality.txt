Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, with a peak of 14.15% in week 6, significantly higher than the 20-week average of 9.96%. This surge correlates with a spike in the absolute number of deaths from both Influenza and Pneumonia, as well as an increase in total deaths during the same period. However, in the most recent week, there has been a dramatic increase in deaths attributed specifically to Influenza, jumping from 152 to 887, then to 629, which is substantially higher than the earlier weeks where deaths ranged from 7 to 56. Despite this uptick in Influenza deaths, the overall mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia has decreased in the last two weeks to below the 20-week average, indicating a potential discrepancy that may suggest a decrease in Pneumonia mortality or a relative stabilization in the total number of deaths. These trends could indicate seasonal patterns, the impact of public health interventions, or emerging health threats, which necessitate continued surveillance and potentially targeted healthcare responses.
