Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching a peak in the late afternoon before beginning to cool slightly into the evening. Humidity levels started moderately before rising significantly overnight, which could have enhanced the early morning chill, but decreased sharply throughout the day, likely contributing to more comfortable conditions by the afternoon. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with only minor fluctuations, indicating a period of stable weather patterns without any significant frontal systems passing through the area. Wind speeds varied modestly, with some calm periods and occasional breezier intervals but remained generally light to moderate overall. The wind direction shifted throughout the day, with predominantly northerly winds in the early hours, a brief period of easterly winds, and a return to northerly and northeasterly directions, suggesting the passage of a weather system moving through the region.
