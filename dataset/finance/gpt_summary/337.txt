Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a general uptrend, increasing by 7.4% from 2868.44 to 3080.82, indicating a positive market sentiment. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, has trended downwards from 33.61 to 26.84, suggesting a decrease in investor fear and market uncertainty. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 reflect a similar positive trajectory, with the Nikkei gaining 13.6% and the FTSE rising by 6.3%, which might indicate a global recovery optimism.

Commodity prices have seen mixed movements; Gold Futures retracted slightly by 1.1%, which could be due to investors shifting towards riskier assets, while Crude Oil Futures surged by 49.8%, potentially due to production cuts or recovery in demand as economies aim to reopen. Exchange rates have remained relatively stable with slight appreciation in the EUR/USD and USD/CNY pairs, which could suggest a modest weakening of the dollar amidst these market conditions.
