Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable increase in the percentage of patients presenting with Influenza-like Illness (ILI), with the ratio of ILI patients rising steadily and surpassing the baseline threshold in recent weeks. This trend is especially pronounced in the younger population, with the age groups 0-4 and 5-24 years showing significant increases in ILI cases, which could suggest higher transmission rates among children and young adults. The elderly population also shows a rising trend, albeit less sharply, which is concerning given their increased vulnerability to complications from ILI. The consistent upward trajectory across all age groups indicates a potential strain on healthcare resources, necessitating increased vigilance, preparedness for higher patient volumes, and possibly the consideration of flu prevention strategies such as vaccination campaigns. The peak in ILI percentage in the most recent weeks warrants close monitoring as it could signal a more severe or widespread influenza season, impacting public health measures and healthcare delivery.
