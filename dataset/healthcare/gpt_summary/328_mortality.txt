Over the past 20 weeks, the mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia has consistently remained below the 7.84% average ratio to total deaths, indicating a downward trend in these specific causes of death relative to overall mortality. The highest percentage observed was in the first week at 6.43%, with a subsequent decline to the lowest at 5.00% in week 14, though there has been a slight uptick in recent weeks, reaching 5.63% by week 20. The total number of deaths from all causes has fluctuated within a narrow range from 55632 to 58375, showing a relatively stable overall mortality rate. However, the number of deaths attributable to pneumonia has shown a slight decrease from 3722 in week 1 to 3141 in week 20, while influenza deaths have varied minimally, with a minor peak in week 2 at 41 deaths. The consistent sub-average performance of these respiratory causes in the overall mortality profile could suggest either a successful healthcare response to managing these conditions or a shift in the burden of disease to other health issues.
