Over the last 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have experienced a gradual increase, indicating a warming trend that peaked in the late afternoon before starting to decrease slightly towards the evening. Humidity levels were high throughout the period, reaching saturation at one point, which could have led to a feeling of mugginess and may have implications for local weather patterns, including the potential for fog or precipitation. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with only minor fluctuations, suggesting a steady atmospheric condition. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a noticeable increase towards the end of the period. The wind direction varied significantly, with periods of calm interspersed with winds predominantly coming from the east-southeast, which is typical for Houstonâ€™s coastal location and could influence local climate conditions such as sea breezes.
