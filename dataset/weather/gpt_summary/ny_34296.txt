Over the past 24 hours in New York City, temperatures have demonstrated a typical diurnal pattern with a gradual increase through the daytime hours, peaking in the late afternoon before a steady decline into the night. Relative humidity levels have shown fluctuations, with notably higher values during the early morning hours, which is common due to cooler temperatures and can lead to morning fog or dew. Air pressure has been slowly decreasing, which may suggest an approaching weather system that could potentially bring unsettled conditions. Wind speeds have been mostly light to moderate throughout the period, with some increase in the later hours that could enhance the wind chill factor slightly. The wind direction has been variable, though predominantly from a southerly direction, shifting more westerly at times, which could influence temperature and humidity levels depending on the origin of the air masses.
