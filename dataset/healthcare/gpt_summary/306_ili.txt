Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a fluctuating but overall downward trend in the ratio of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) patients, with recent weeks showing a slight uptick. This trend is accompanied by a consistent decrease in the number of ILI cases among older populations, particularly those aged 50 and above, while a notable increase in ILI cases has been observed in the youngest age group (0-4 years). Despite the overall decrease in ILI ratios, the absolute number of patients has remained relatively high, suggesting that the healthcare system must remain vigilant in managing not only ILI but also other concurrent health issues. The increase in ILI prevalence among young children could indicate a need for heightened focus on this demographic, including possible public health interventions to prevent further spread. The data underscores the importance of continuous monitoring of ILI trends across different age groups to allocate healthcare resources effectively and prepare for potential increases in healthcare demand.
