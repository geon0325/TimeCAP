Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual rise in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before slightly cooling off towards the evening. Humidity levels were very high during the early morning hours, indicating the presence of considerable moisture in the air, but they decreased as temperatures rose. Air pressure has remained relatively stable, with a slight decreasing trend noted, which could suggest the possibility of changing weather patterns or the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds increased from calm to moderate throughout the day, suggesting an intensification of weather activity, with the prevailing winds shifting from southeasterly to southerly and occasionally veering towards a southwesterly direction. The combination of high humidity, increasing temperatures, and varying wind directions could potentially lead to the development of thunderstorms or other weather disturbances in the Houston area.
