Over the last 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching a peak in the late afternoon before slightly dropping again, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels started relatively high but showed a decreasing trend throughout the day, which could have contributed to a sense of comfort despite the rising temperatures. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a minor fluctuation that is not likely to have had a significant impact on weather conditions. Wind speeds were consistent, maintaining a light breeze, with a slight increase observed later in the day that could have provided some relief from the warmth. The wind direction was generally from the south to the south-southeast, which often brings warmer air masses to the region.
