Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, indicating the onset of warmer conditions as the day progressed. The humidity levels were high throughout the period, with a noticeable decrease towards the late afternoon and evening, which may have brought some relief from the earlier mugginess. The air pressure showed a slight decreasing trend, which could suggest the potential development of unstable weather conditions, possibly leading to precipitation or storm activity. Wind speeds fluctuated but showed a significant increase towards the evening, which might have contributed to a cooler feel despite the higher temperatures. The prevailing wind direction was generally southerly, with occasional shifts, which is typical for Houston and can bring in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, influencing both humidity and temperature.
