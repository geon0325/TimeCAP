Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a general decline in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with an initial ratio of 1.03% in week 1 dropping to 0.13% by week 20. The data indicates that Influenza A has consistently been the more prevalent strain, though its incidence has also decreased from 0.64% to 0.07%. Conversely, Influenza B showed a less consistent pattern with fluctuations in its positivity ratio, yet ended with the same low positivity rate of 0.07% as Influenza A by week 20. The overall average positivity ratio of 6.26% over the 20 weeks suggests that the latest value of 0.13% is substantially below the average, which could indicate that influenza is currently less of a strain on healthcare resources. However, the healthcare system should remain vigilant for potential increases in influenza activity, as seasonal trends can lead to sudden changes in infection rates.
