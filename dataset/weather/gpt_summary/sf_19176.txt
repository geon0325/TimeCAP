Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have experienced slight fluctuations, generally maintaining a cool to mild range, with a subtle warming trend observed in the latter part of the period. The relative humidity has been notably high throughout, reaching saturation at several points, which suggests a high likelihood of fog or mist, particularly during the night and early morning hours. Air pressure has been gradually decreasing, indicating a potential shift in weather patterns that could lead to changing conditions in the near future. The wind has remained light and variable in direction, though there has been a slight increase in wind speed recently, which could help to disperse the high humidity and any fog present. Overall, the current weather situation appears to be stable with a trend towards slightly warmer temperatures, but the decreasing air pressure and increasing wind speed may suggest upcoming changes in weather conditions.
