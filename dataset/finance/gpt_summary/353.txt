The VIX, or fear index, corroborates this sentiment, starting at 28.59 and spiking to 40.79 before settling at 33.84, indicating increased market volatility and risk. In international markets, the Nikkei 225 showed resilience with a general upward trend despite some fluctuations, closing slightly lower than its peak, while the FTSE 100 witnessed a similar pattern but ended on a more pronounced decline, suggesting regional economic pressures.

Gold futures saw an overall increase from 1713.30 to 1765.80, suggesting a flight to safety among investors amid market turbulence, while Crude Oil futures displayed a general upward trend from 33.71 to 38.01, potentially indicating recovering demand or production adjustments. Exchange rates exhibited relative stability with minor fluctuations, with the EUR/USD pair slightly strengthening and the USD/JPY and USD/CNY pairs showing marginal depreciation of the dollar, which may reflect shifting investor confidence in the currency markets.
