Over the last 24 hours in Houston, there has been a general trend of increasing temperature, which peaked during the latter part of the day before gradually cooling off by the early hours of the following day. Humidity levels fluctuated considerably, with very high levels observed during the early morning hours, which is typical due to overnight cooling, and notably lower humidity during the afternoon, in line with the diurnal pattern. Air pressure showed a slight but steady decline throughout the period, which could indicate the approach of a weather system or front. Wind speed varied, with some hours experiencing calm conditions and others seeing brisk winds; a peak in wind speed was noted towards the evening. Wind direction was predominantly from the south to southeast, which in Houston is often associated with warm, moist air coming from the Gulf of Mexico and can sometimes precede stormy conditions.
