Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak during the late afternoon hours, suggesting typical diurnal temperature variation. Concurrently, humidity levels showed an inverse relationship to temperature, with the highest values recorded during the early morning when temperatures were lower and decreasing as temperatures rose, indicative of the common pattern where warmer air can hold more moisture, thus lowering relative humidity. Air pressure exhibited a slight fluctuation throughout the day but showed a notable increase towards the evening, which could signal the approach of a high-pressure system potentially leading to clearer skies and calmer weather. Wind speeds remained mostly light with little variation, while wind direction shifted significantly throughout the day, indicating the presence of varying air masses influencing local weather patterns. The combination of increasing temperatures, fluctuating humidity, and varying wind directions suggests an active weather pattern that could lead to changes in weather conditions in the short term.
