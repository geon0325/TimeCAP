Over the past 24 hours in New York City, there has been a gradual decline in temperature, transitioning from near-freezing conditions to distinctly colder temperatures indicative of a cold front passage. Humidity levels experienced moderate fluctuations, with notable dips and peaks, suggesting variable atmospheric moisture content possibly associated with the passing weather system. Air pressure showed a significant increase in the latter part of the day, indicating the likely arrival of a high-pressure system, which typically brings clearer skies and more stable weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally moderate to brisk throughout the period, with an uptick in the latter half, which could contribute to wind chill effects, making it feel colder than actual temperatures suggest. The wind direction was predominantly from the west-northwest, with shifts toward the north and back, consistent with the passage of the cold front and subsequent reinforcement by northerly winds behind the front.
