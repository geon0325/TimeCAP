Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a steady increase in the number of influenza-like illness (ILI) cases across all age groups, with the most significant rise seen among the 0-4 and 5-24 age groups. Notably, the ratio of ILI patients has seen a persistent upward trend, surpassing the baseline of 2.9% in the most recent weeks, suggesting a heightened intensity of ILI activity. The older age groups, while experiencing lower overall numbers, also show a consistent increase in ILI cases, indicating that the virus is affecting a wide spectrum of the population. This upward trajectory in ILI ratios is indicative of a potential strain on healthcare resources, as an increasing number of patients may seek medical care, possibly leading to an escalation in hospital visits and a need for increased vigilance in disease management and prevention strategies. The latest figures, which reflect a ratio significantly above the baseline, underscore an urgent need for healthcare providers to prepare for heightened demands on services and consider public health interventions to mitigate the spread of illness.
