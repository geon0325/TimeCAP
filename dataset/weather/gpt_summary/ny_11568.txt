Over the past day, New York City experienced a gradual rise in temperature, peaking during the late afternoon before cooling slightly towards the evening. Humidity levels showed an inverse pattern, with a notable decrease in the late evening, suggesting drier air moving into the area. Air pressure decreased steadily throughout much of the day, indicating the potential development or approach of a weather system, but later increased, suggesting that the system may be moving away or weakening. Wind speeds were generally light but picked up significantly in the evening, with a sharp increase that could have amplified the chill factor. The wind direction varied throughout the day, predominantly coming from the south before shifting to westerly and then to a more northerly direction by the end of the period, which could have contributed to the changes in temperature and humidity experienced.
