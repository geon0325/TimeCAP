Over the past 20 weeks, the data indicates a consistent upward trend in the incidence of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) across all age groups. The increase is most pronounced in the youngest (0-4 years) and school-aged children (5-24 years), suggesting that ILI is spreading significantly within these populations. Although the overall ratio of ILI patients has remained below the baseline of 2.9%, there has been a notable rise in recent weeks, approaching this threshold. This trend, if it continues, could signal an impending surge that may strain healthcare resources, necessitating increased vigilance and potentially preventative measures. The steady growth in ILI cases among older age groups (50 and above) is also concerning, as it may lead to more severe health outcomes and increased hospitalization rates in these more vulnerable populations.
