Over the last 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual increase in temperature with a noticeable peak during the latter part of the period, indicative of warm conditions progressing into the day. Simultaneously, relative humidity levels displayed a decreasing trend, which when combined with the rising temperatures, suggests a decrease in perceived mugginess and potential for more comfortable conditions. The air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with a slight variation towards the end, which could be associated with stable weather patterns without significant changes in the short term. Wind speeds were generally light to gentle and increased slightly, maintaining consistency which is typical for a calm weather scenario. Wind direction was predominantly from the east to northeast, which could have implications for localized weather patterns, including potential for sea breezes in coastal areas.
