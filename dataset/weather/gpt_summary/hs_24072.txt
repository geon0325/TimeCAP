Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the later hours before showing a slight decrease. Humidity levels were significantly high during the night, even hitting saturation, but decreased markedly during the day, indicating possible early morning fog clearing up as the day progressed. Air pressure remained relatively stable with only minor fluctuations, suggesting stable weather conditions without the presence of any significant frontal systems. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with an increase observed during the day, which could have contributed to the dispersal of humidity. The wind direction varied but predominantly came from the south, which is typical for Houston and can bring warmer air from the Gulf of Mexico, influencing both temperature and humidity levels.
