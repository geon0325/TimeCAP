Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with an initial downward trend, followed by a recovery to close higher than the starting point, suggesting a possible return of investor confidence. The VIX, known as the fear gauge, initially increased, indicating higher market volatility and investor anxiety, but subsequently decreased, aligning with the recovery observed in the S&P 500. Global indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 experienced declines and subsequent partial recoveries, reflecting a similar pattern of market unease followed by cautious optimism. Commodity prices like Gold and Crude Oil Futures initially rose, potentially due to investors seeking safe havens and concerns over supply disruptions, but Gold prices have since moderated while Oil remains elevated, signaling ongoing market concerns about geopolitical tensions and inflationary pressures. The foreign exchange rates saw the Euro and Yen appreciate against the Dollar, while the Chinese Yuan remained relatively stable against the Dollar, indicating shifts in currency strength that could influence international trade dynamics and cross-border investment flows.
