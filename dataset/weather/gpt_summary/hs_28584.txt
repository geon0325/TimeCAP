Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a gradual increase in temperature, indicating a warming trend likely to continue into the next day. Humidity levels have remained high, persistently hovering around the upper range, which may lead to a muggy feeling in the air and the potential for fog or dew formation, especially during the early morning or late evening hours. Air pressure has shown a slight but steady decline, suggesting that an approaching weather system might bring changes, possibly including increased cloud cover or precipitation. Wind speeds have been mostly light to moderate, with a slight increase during the latter part of the period, which could contribute to a slight wind chill effect, although the rising temperatures may offset this. The wind direction has been variable, predominantly coming from the east, with some shifts towards the south, which is typical for this region and may continue to transport moisture from the Gulf of Mexico into the area, maintaining high humidity levels.
