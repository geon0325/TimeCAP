Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable decline in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to overall deaths, decreasing from 8.53% to 5.58%. This downward trend indicates a significant reduction in deaths attributable to these respiratory conditions, with the total number of deaths from Influenza dropping from 605 to 18 and from Pneumonia decreasing from 4369 to 2824. Despite the overall decline, the mortality ratio remains higher than the average ratio of 7.84%, suggesting that Influenza and Pneumonia still constitute a considerable proportion of the total mortality. The reduction in deaths could be due to seasonal variations, improved vaccination rates, or better healthcare interventions. Nonetheless, the consistently higher-than-average mortality ratio underscores the need for ongoing surveillance and targeted healthcare strategies to manage and prevent these respiratory diseases.
