Over the past day, San Francisco experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature with a general cooling trend during the early hours, followed by a gradual increase later in the day. Humidity levels remained very high for most of the period, hitting saturation at several points, which may have led to foggy conditions particularly in the early morning and late evening hours. Air pressure was relatively stable but showed a slight downward trend, indicating the possibility of an approaching weather system or front.

The wind direction shifted throughout the day, predominantly coming from the west-northwest, which is typical for San Francisco's oceanic climate influence.
