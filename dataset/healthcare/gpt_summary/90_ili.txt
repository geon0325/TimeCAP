Over the past 20 weeks, the data indicates a progressive increase in the percentage of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) patients across all age groups, with the most significant rises observed in younger populations, particularly those aged 5-24. Initially, the ratio of ILI patients remained well below the baseline, but there has been a notable upward trend, with recent weeks surpassing the threshold that determines an elevated influenza situation. The age group of 5-24 years has seen a dramatic escalation in ILI cases, which could suggest increased transmission within school or community settings. Older age groups, while experiencing a slower rate of increase, have also shown a consistent rise in ILI cases, which raises concerns about the potential strain on healthcare resources, especially in managing the needs of the most vulnerable populations. The current trend, if sustained, may require enhanced public health measures, increased vaccination efforts, and preparedness in the healthcare system to manage a potential surge in influenza cases.
