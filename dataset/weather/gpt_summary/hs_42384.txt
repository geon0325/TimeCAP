Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has shown a steady increase, reaching its peak in the later hours, indicative of a warming trend. Humidity levels have fluctuated considerably, starting very high and then decreasing significantly, which could suggest a transition from more muggy conditions to drier air throughout the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight rising trend, possibly signaling a period of settled weather. Wind speeds were generally light to gentle, with minor variations, and the wind direction was predominantly from the east to northeast, though there was a brief period where it shifted and came from the north. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and stable pressure suggests a likelihood of fair weather conditions, but the persistent easterly winds could bring moisture from the Gulf, affecting local weather patterns.
