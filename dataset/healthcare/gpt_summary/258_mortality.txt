Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable decline in the proportion of deaths due to influenza and pneumonia, with the ratio of mortality from these causes dropping from a high of 18.51% to 5.96% by the end of the period. This decrease is significantly below the average ratio of 7.84%, indicating an improving situation in terms of influenza and pneumonia mortality. Despite the overall reduction in mortality rates, there was a brief spike in deaths attributed to influenza alone, peaking at 187 in the fourth week, which may suggest a temporary outbreak or increased virulence of the influenza virus during that period. The total number of deaths from all causes also shows a downward trend, moving from 82,800 to 57,278, which could imply improvements in general health conditions or seasonal variations affecting mortality rates. The healthcare system should continue to monitor these trends closely as they suggest a reduction in the burden of influenza and pneumonia, but also the need for vigilance for potential spikes in influenza-related deaths.
