Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has shown a gradual decline from its peak in the early hours, reaching its lowest point before dawn and then slightly rising again towards the evening. Humidity levels started relatively moderate but increased significantly overnight, suggesting the presence of more moisture in the air, which then decreased sharply during the day, indicating drier conditions. Air pressure has been steadily increasing, suggesting a stabilizing atmosphere which could lead to clearer skies. Wind speeds varied, with calmer conditions around dawn and stronger gusts later in the day, while the wind direction shifted from southerly to northerly, indicating a possible frontal passage through the area. These conditions combined—rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and shifting wind—could be indicative of a departing weather system and the potential for clearer and more stable weather in the near term.
