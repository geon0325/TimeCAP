Over the past 24 hours, the temperature in Houston has displayed a typical diurnal pattern, with a gradual decline during the overnight hours followed by a steady increase after sunrise, before stabilizing later in the day. Relative humidity levels have generally been high, frequently reaching levels conducive to a feeling of mugginess, with slight fluctuations that appear to have had minimal impact on the overall humid conditions. Atmospheric pressure has shown a slight decreasing trend, suggesting a possible approach of a weather system that could lead to changing weather conditions in the near term. Wind speeds have varied but remained mostly moderate, with occasional higher gusts that could influence the dispersion of humidity and the perception of temperature. The wind direction has been predominantly from the southeasterly to southerly quadrant, which is typical for Houston and can contribute to the transportation of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico into the region.
