Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a general uptrend with a notable dip towards the latter part of the period, suggesting a potential increase in market uncertainty or profit-taking by investors. Volatility, as measured by the VIX, has increased, particularly during the S&P 500's dip, which could indicate higher investor anxiety and the possibility of more significant market swings in the near term. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 indices experienced fluctuations with the Nikkei showing a slight upward trend while the FTSE 100 displayed overall weakness, reflecting regional economic sentiments and possibly the impact of local market drivers. Gold futures have seen some volatility but remained relatively stable, hinting at sustained investor interest in safe-haven assets amid market fluctuations. Meanwhile, Crude Oil futures experienced a downward trend possibly due to demand concerns, and major currency pairs such as EUR/USD and USD/JPY have been relatively stable, suggesting currency markets are currently less volatile compared to equity markets.
