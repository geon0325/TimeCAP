The time-series data indicates a notable increase in the percentage of ILI patients over the 20-week period, surpassing the baseline ratio for determining the influenza situation. This increase has been most pronounced in the younger age groups, particularly those aged 5-24, which saw a substantial rise in ILI cases. The data also shows that older age groups have been affected, with a steady number of cases in individuals aged 65 or more. After reaching a peak, there has been a decline in the later weeks across all age groups, yet the percentage of ILI patients remains above the threshold in several of these weeks. This trend suggests a significant burden on the healthcare system, highlighting the need for continued monitoring and possibly increased healthcare resources to manage the higher volume of patients with ILI symptoms.
