Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia to the total number of deaths has been consistently below the average of 7.84%, ranging from 5.00% to 6.09%. The total number of deaths has fluctuated, with a notable increase in the last week to 59,545. Deaths from pneumonia have shown a slight upward trend, rising from 3,251 to 3,544, while deaths from influenza have remained relatively low and stable, with a minor peak at 41 in the second week. The overall mortality ratio from these illnesses peaked at 6.09% in the 16th week and dipped to its lowest at 5.00% in the 9th week. These trends suggest a lower impact of Influenza or Pneumonia on total mortality compared to historical averages, but the recent increase in total deaths warrants close monitoring for potential healthcare system strain.
