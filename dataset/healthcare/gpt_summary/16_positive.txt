Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant fluctuation in the rate of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a peak ratio of positive specimens at 23.65% in week 7, followed by a steady decline to 3.02% by week 20. The proportion of Influenza A positive specimens showed a similar trend, peaking at 18.16% in week 7 and dropping to 0.76% by week 20, indicating that Influenza A was the predominant strain during the peak weeks. In contrast, the ratio of Influenza B positive specimens has been less variable, ranging from 1.98% to 6.69%, and has remained relatively stable even as the overall positivity rate declined. The overall decline in positive specimens suggests that the influenza season may be waning; however, the consistent presence of Influenza B indicates ongoing transmission that healthcare providers should continue to monitor. These trends are critical for healthcare resource planning, indicating potential decreases in the burden on healthcare systems but also the need for sustained vigilance against influenza transmission.
