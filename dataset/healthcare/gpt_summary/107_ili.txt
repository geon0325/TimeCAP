Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable decline in the number of patients presenting with Influenza-like Illness (ILI) across all age groups, with the most significant decrease observed in the youngest (0-4 years) and school-aged children (5-24 years) cohorts. In the initial weeks, the ratio of ILI patients was well above the baseline, indicating a heightened level of influenza activity, which has since fallen below the threshold, suggesting a reduction in ILI prevalence. While the decrease in ILI cases is a positive development, the healthcare system must remain vigilant, as even lower levels of ILI can put certain populations, particularly the elderly and those with chronic conditions, at risk. The downtrend in ILI ratios could also reflect the effectiveness of public health interventions and seasonal patterns, but continuous monitoring is essential to detect any early signs of a resurgence. Finally, the data highlights the importance of ongoing influenza surveillance and the potential need for targeted healthcare resources for vulnerable populations during periods of higher ILI activity.
