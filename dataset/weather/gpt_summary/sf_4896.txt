Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperature exhibited a typical diurnal pattern, peaking during the day and reaching its lowest point in the early morning hours. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with a noticeable increase during the night, which is consistent with the cooling temperatures, and a sharp decrease during the afternoon, likely due to heating and mixing of the air. Air pressure remained relatively stable, indicating no major weather systems moving through the area that would cause significant fluctuations. Wind speeds varied, with stronger winds earlier in the period and calming towards the middle, before increasing again towards the end of the 24-hour period. The wind direction was predominantly from the west-northwest, except for a brief shift to easterly and then northerly directions, which could influence coastal conditions and temperature distribution within the city.
