Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have exhibited a diurnal pattern, with a peak during the day followed by a gradual cool down overnight into the early morning hours, before rising again. Humidity levels have fluctuated significantly, reaching a peak around the same time temperatures were at their lowest, which is indicative of a typical inverse relationship between temperature and humidity. Air pressure has remained relatively stable with only minor fluctuations, indicating no significant weather fronts moving through the area. Wind speeds have varied, with a noticeable increase in the later hours, which could impact local conditions such as increasing the potential for wind-related effects on outdoor activities. The wind direction has been variable but predominantly from a southerly direction, shifting towards the west and then veering to northerly and easterly directions at times, suggesting the passage of different air masses through the region.
