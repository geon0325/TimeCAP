Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable increase in the number of respiratory specimens testing positive for both Influenza A and B, with the total number of positive specimens growing from 432 in the first week to 1011 in the last week. The ratio of positive specimens for Influenza A has risen more sharply than that of Influenza B, peaking at 1.04% in the final week compared to 0.48% for Influenza B, indicating that Influenza A is driving the increase in flu cases. Despite fluctuations, the overall trend shows a progressive increase in the percentage of positive specimens, reaching a high of 1.51% in the last week, more than double the 20-week average of 6.26%. This upward trend is accompanied by an increase in the number of specimens tested, with the final week seeing 66,801 tests, a significant rise from the initial figure of 39,470. The data suggests an intensifying influenza season, which could strain healthcare resources and necessitates preparedness in managing a growing number of flu cases.
