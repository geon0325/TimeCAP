Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown an overall upward trend, increasing from 2743.07 to 2879.39, indicating a positive investor sentiment and a potentially robust equity market. The VIX, which measures market volatility, remained relatively low and stable, with a slight increase from 16.05 to 13.58, suggesting that investors may not be anticipating significant short-term market turbulence. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 also experienced gains, with the Nikkei climbing from 21025.56 to 21724.95 and the FTSE moving from 7104.30 to 7401.90, reflecting strength in global equity markets. Gold Futures prices have been mostly static, starting at 1297.00 and ending at 1289.00, which could imply that investors are not currently seeking safe-haven assets. Lastly, the exchange rates for major currencies have shown minor fluctuations against the US dollar, with the EUR/USD and USD/JPY pairs showing slight depreciation of the dollar, while the USD/CNY pair indicates the dollar has been relatively stable against the Chinese yuan.
