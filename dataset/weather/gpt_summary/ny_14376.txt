Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature, with a general trend of cooling followed by a gradual warming. Humidity levels have seen significant variance, reaching near-saturation at one point, which could indicate the presence or potential for fog and mist, particularly when coupled with low wind speeds observed throughout the day. Atmospheric pressure has been rising steadily, suggesting an incoming high-pressure system that might lead to clearer and more stable weather conditions. Winds have remained light and variable in direction, with no dominant wind pattern, which is typical of a transitioning weather system. The combination of rising pressure, variable winds, and high humidity could lead to a mix of weather patterns, including the possibility of clear skies interspersed with periods of mist or light precipitation.
