Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a moderate fluctuation in temperature, with a general trend toward warming during the daytime, followed by a subsequent cooling period later in the evening and into the night. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, indicative of possible low-level cloud cover or fog formation, but decreased significantly as the day progressed, suggesting the dispersal of such conditions due to rising temperatures. Air pressure remained relatively stable, showing a slight increase towards the middle of the day, which is consistent with fair weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to gentle and displayed minor variability throughout the period. Wind direction was predominantly from the south, shifting occasionally, which is typical for Houston's location on the Gulf Coast and can contribute to the transport of moisture into the area.
