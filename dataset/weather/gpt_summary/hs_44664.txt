Over the last 24 hours in Houston, the temperature exhibited a rising trend, transitioning from mild to notably warmer conditions, particularly during the afternoon hours. Humidity levels started relatively high but decreased significantly as the temperature peaked, indicating drier air moving into the area during the hottest part of the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable with only slight fluctuations, maintaining conditions typical for stable weather patterns. Wind speeds varied modestly, with occasional increases that could contribute to a mild cooling effect, despite the overall warmer temperatures. The wind direction was predominantly from the south to south-east, which is often associated with warm air advection in Houston, reinforcing the observed increase in temperatures.
