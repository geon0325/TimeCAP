Over the past 20 weeks, the testing of respiratory specimens has revealed a fluctuating pattern of influenza positivity with an average positive rate of 6.26%. The data indicates a decreasing trend in the number of specimens tested for influenza, starting from 99,616 in week 1 to 39,470 in week 20. Despite these fluctuations, the proportion of positive Influenza B specimens has shown a generally increasing trend until week 19, contrasting with the more stable, slightly decreasing trend of Influenza A positivity rates. The peak positivity rate for Influenza B was 0.78% in week 17, while Influenza A peaked at 1.95% in week 1. Considering the average positive ratio is relatively low, the current pressure on the healthcare system due to influenza may be moderate; however, the rise in Influenza B rates in recent weeks could indicate a need for increased vigilance and possibly vaccination efforts targeting this strain.
