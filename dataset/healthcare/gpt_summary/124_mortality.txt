Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable decline in the percentage of deaths attributable to influenza or pneumonia when compared to total deaths, with the proportion starting at 5.92% and decreasing to a low of 4.90% before rising to 5.69% in the most recent week. The total number of deaths has fluctuated slightly but shows a modest decreasing trend over the period, starting at 53,679 and ending at 52,357. Despite the overall decrease in the ratio of influenza or pneumonia deaths, the absolute number of deaths from pneumonia has seen a recent uptick, climbing from a low of 2,515 to 2,969 in the last reported week. In contrast, deaths from influenza have remained relatively low and stable, with a slight increase from 16 to 10 deaths in the final week. These trends suggest a potential seasonal reduction in influenza mortality, while pneumonia remains a more consistent contributor to mortality, with a recent increase that warrants close monitoring by healthcare providers and policymakers.
