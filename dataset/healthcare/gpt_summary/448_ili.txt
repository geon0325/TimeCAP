Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a consistent and notable increase in the proportion of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases across all age groups. The data shows that the ratio of ILI patients has escalated from 1.36% to 6.31%, surpassing the threshold of 2.9% from week 13 onwards, indicating a substantial rise in influenza activity. The age groups of 0-4 and 5-24 years have experienced the highest increase in ILI cases, suggesting a potentially higher transmission rate among younger populations. This sustained upward trend has resulted in the ILI ratio more than quadrupling, reflecting an urgent need for healthcare resources to manage the increase in patient volume. The data suggests that the healthcare system may face significant strain, necessitating increased preparedness for influenza management and potentially affecting other healthcare services due to the reallocation of resources.
