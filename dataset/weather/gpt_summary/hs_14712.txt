Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching a peak in the late afternoon before slightly cooling down towards the evening. Humidity levels have shown notable fluctuations, with a peak of saturation around sunrise that could have resulted in early morning fog or dew, and a general decrease during the day which is typical as temperatures rise. Air pressure has been relatively stable with only minor variations, indicating steady weather conditions without the immediate onset of significant weather systems. Wind speeds have been mostly light to moderate, with one period of increased wind speed in the late evening, suggesting the possibility of a passing weather front or localized atmospheric disturbance. The wind direction has been variable, although primarily from the south to southeast, which is common for Houston and can contribute to the city's humidity levels due to the influx of moist Gulf air.
