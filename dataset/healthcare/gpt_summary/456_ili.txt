Over the past 20 weeks, the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) activity has shown a concerning upward trend, surpassing the 2.9% severity benchmark in week 5 and reaching a peak of 6.31% in week 12. This surge indicates a significant increase in ILI cases among all age groups, with the highest proportional increases observed in the 5-24 and 25-49 age brackets, suggesting a greater spread within these more socially active populations. Despite a slight decline post-peak, the ILI ratio remains above the severity threshold, closing at 4.34% in week 20. The sustained high levels of ILI incidence could strain healthcare resources, necessitating increased vigilance and potentially the allocation of additional medical services and preventative measures. Given the trend, it is crucial for health authorities to monitor the situation closely and prepare for continued elevated ILI activity in the coming weeks.
