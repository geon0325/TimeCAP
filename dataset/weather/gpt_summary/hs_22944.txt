Over the last 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual increase in temperature, indicating a warming trend that peaked during the latter part of the period. Humidity levels showed a decreasing pattern towards the end of the 24-hour timespan, which could suggest a degree of increasing comfort or a reduction in the mugginess often associated with the city. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with only a slight decrease, implying stable weather conditions. Wind speeds saw a steady increase, suggesting that conditions may have become breezier as time progressed. The wind direction was predominantly from the south-southeast, which is typical for Houston and can contribute to bringing in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, potentially affecting local weather patterns.
