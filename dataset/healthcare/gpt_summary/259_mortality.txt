Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable decline in the ratio of mortality due to Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, starting at 17.72% and ending at 5.81%, indicating a downward trend well below the average ratio of 7.84%. The total number of deaths fluctuated, with a peak at the second week (86858 deaths), but the overall trend shows a gradual decrease over the period. Deaths from pneumonia significantly outnumbered those from influenza, with pneumonia cases contributing the most to the mortality ratio for this category. The declining mortality ratio suggests either an improvement in the management and treatment of these respiratory conditions or a shift in the cause of mortality to other diseases or factors. These trends could indicate a positive response to public health interventions or seasonal variations and should be considered when allocating healthcare resources and planning for future influenza seasons.
