Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 exhibited a general upward trend, closing higher at 4167.59 from an initial 4097.17, indicating a stable to positive sentiment in the US equity market. The VIX, which measures market volatility, has slightly increased from 16.95 to 19.15, suggesting a growing sense of uncertainty or risk among investors. In contrast, the Nikkei 225 showed a downward trend, ending at the same value for the last four days, which could signify stagnation or a lack of positive triggers in the Japanese market. Gold futures fluctuated but ended with a slight increase from 1756.80 to 1784.10, which can be seen as a hedge against the increased volatility and a sign of cautious investor behavior. Exchange rates saw minor fluctuations with the USD strengthening against the JPY and CNY, while the EUR/USD pair remained relatively stable, indicating a mixed view on the US dollar's strength in the currency markets.
