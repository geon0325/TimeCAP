Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, peaking during the late afternoon hours, indicative of typical diurnal heating patterns. Humidity levels showed a marked decrease from very high values in the early morning to lower levels by the afternoon, which is consistent with the temperature rise and suggests a possible discomfort due to mugginess earlier in the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with slight fluctuations that are not indicative of significant weather changes. Wind speeds varied, with a noticeable increase during the late afternoon, potentially offering some relief from the heat. The wind direction was predominantly southerly, shifting to westerly at one point, which could have contributed to the warmer temperatures due to warm air advection from the south.
