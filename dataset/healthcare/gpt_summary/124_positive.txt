Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable decline in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the initial combined rate of 22.62% dropping to just 1.00% by the end of the observed period. This trend is reflected in both Influenza A and B, with Influenza A decreasing from 11.95% to 0.64% and Influenza B from 10.66% to 0.36%. Despite a decrease in the number of specimens tested (from 60,034 to 6,879), the decrease in positive cases outpaces this decline, suggesting a genuine reduction in influenza prevalence. However, the healthcare system should remain vigilant for potential fluctuations, as a decrease in testing could mask the true incidence of the disease. The significant decrease in influenza positivity rates suggests that the healthcare system may currently face less strain from influenza but should be prepared for seasonal variations or unexpected surges.
