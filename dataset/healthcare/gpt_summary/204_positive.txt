Over the past 20 weeks, the data indicates a concerning upward trend in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a marked increase from an average of 6.26% to a peak of 26.08% in the latest week. Influenza B has been consistently more prevalent than Influenza A, as evidenced by the higher percentages of positive specimens, culminating in near parity in the last week with Influenza A at 12.79% and Influenza B at 13.30%. The number of specimens tested has generally increased over the time period, suggesting heightened surveillance or increased incidence of respiratory illness. The substantial rise in positive specimens, particularly in recent weeks, highlights a significant surge in influenza activity, which could strain healthcare resources and necessitates increased readiness for patient care, vaccination efforts, and public health interventions. The data underscores the need for ongoing monitoring and response coordination to address the growing impact of influenza on the population.
