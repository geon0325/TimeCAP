Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable increase in the mortality ratio of deaths from influenza or pneumonia compared to total deaths, rising from below the 20-week average of 7.84% to a peak of 8.33% in week 13, before settling at 7.55% in week 20. The actual number of deaths attributed to influenza has shown an alarming upward trend, starting at 16 deaths in week 1 and escalating to 483 deaths by week 20, representing a substantial 30-fold increase. Pneumonia-related deaths have fluctuated but remained significantly higher than influenza, starting at 3022 in week 1 and peaking at 4418 in week 13, with a slight decrease to 3896 by week 20. This rise in mortality from respiratory illnesses could indicate a more virulent strain of influenza, an increase in susceptibility within the population, or possibly co-circulation with other respiratory pathogens, which may strain healthcare resources. Public health agencies may need to consider bolstering vaccination programs, issuing health advisories, and preparing hospitals for an increased number of patients with respiratory complications.
