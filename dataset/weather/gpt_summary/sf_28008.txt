Over the last 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, indicative of a typical coastal climate with no significant warm or cold trends. Humidity levels experienced some variability, with instances of higher humidity that could have contributed to a feeling of increased dampness or potential fog development, especially during the early morning hours. Air pressure showed a slight decreasing trend over the period, which may suggest the approach of a weather system that could lead to changes in the weather pattern. Wind speeds varied, with periods of calm followed by a noticeable increase, potentially affecting maritime activities and bringing a wind chill effect that could make the air feel cooler than the actual temperature. The wind direction shifted throughout the day, predominantly from the south and southeast earlier to a more westerly and northwesterly direction later, which could influence coastal weather conditions and the movement of marine layers.
