Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have exhibited a typical diurnal pattern, rising from morning through the afternoon to reach a peak and then gradually declining into the night. Humidity levels have fluctuated, showing higher values during the cooler early hours and reducing as temperatures increased, which is indicative of the relative nature of humidity. Air pressure has been on a steady decline throughout the period, suggesting the possibility of an approaching weather system that could affect local conditions. Wind speed experienced some variability, with occasional higher gusts, while the prevailing wind direction has shifted from southeasterly to more southerly and eventually southwesterly, which could be influencing the temperature and humidity trends. The combination of these factors points towards an unsettled weather pattern that might evolve over the coming days.
