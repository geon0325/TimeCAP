Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have experienced a gradual decline before slightly rising again, reflecting a typical diurnal pattern with cooler temperatures during the early morning hours. Humidity levels followed an inverse trend to temperature, increasing overnight as temperatures fell, and then decreasing throughout the day, which is consistent with the absorption and release of atmospheric moisture in relation to temperature changes. Air pressure has remained relatively high and stable with only slight fluctuations, indicating a period of settled weather and potentially clear skies. Wind speeds have been mostly gentle and have not shown significant variation, suggesting a calm wind pattern without any strong gusts or stormy conditions. The wind direction varied, initially from the south, shifting to northerly directions, and then to easterly, which could imply the passage of a weather front or system through the area.
