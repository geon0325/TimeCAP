Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature exhibited a typical diurnal cycle with a peak during the afternoon hours and a gradual decrease overnight. Relative humidity showed an inverse relationship to temperature, with its highest values recorded during the early morning hours when temperatures were at their lowest, indicating a possibility of morning dew or fog formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting a period of steady weather without significant front activity. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with the highest gusts observed in the late evening, which could have contributed to cooler perceived temperatures and dispersion of humidity. The wind direction was variable throughout the day, with a tendency to shift from southerly to more westerly directions, which often signals a change in weather patterns, possibly due to the passage of a weak front or local thermal effects.
