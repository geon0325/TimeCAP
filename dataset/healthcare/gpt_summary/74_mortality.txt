Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a slight upward trend in the ratio of mortality due to Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, starting at 5.62% and ending at 6.10%, an increase that exceeds the average of 5.21% to 5.85% in the preceding weeks. Despite fluctuations, the total number of deaths increased towards the end of the 20-week period, with the highest recorded in the last week at 52,228. The number of deaths from Influenza has shown an upward trajectory in the last three weeks, culminating in 28 deaths, which is double the count from the start of the period. Pneumonia-related deaths also rose, with an increment from 2,908 to 3,156 deaths over the same timeframe. These trends suggest a growing impact of respiratory infections on overall mortality and could indicate a need for increased healthcare resources and public health interventions targeting Influenza and Pneumonia prevention and treatment.
