Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a fluctuating but generally increasing trend in the ratio of patients experiencing Influenza-like Illness (ILI), with periods where the ratio surpasses the baseline of 2.9%, suggesting heightened levels of ILI activity. Notably, the age group 5-24 shows substantial variability with a peak that coincides with the highest overall ILI patient ratio, possibly reflecting transmission dynamics in schools and among young adults. The oldest age group, 65 or more, although contributing fewer ILI cases in raw numbers, consistently shows ILI presence which is a concern given their vulnerability to complications. The recent decrease in the overall ILI ratio suggests a possible decline in ILI activity, yet it remains above the baseline, indicating that ILI is still more prevalent than usual. This sustained elevation in ILI cases could continue to strain healthcare resources, necessitating ongoing public health vigilance and resource allocation to manage the increased patient load.
