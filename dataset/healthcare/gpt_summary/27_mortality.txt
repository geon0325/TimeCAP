Over the last 20 weeks, mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia as a percentage of total deaths has fluctuated, averaging 5.85%, which is below the historical average of 7.84%. The total number of deaths has shown a slight upward trend, peaking in week 20 with 53,169 deaths. However, deaths specifically attributable to Influenza have not followed a clear trend, ranging from a low of 3 to a high of 22, without a discernible pattern. Deaths from Pneumonia have been more consistent, with a slight increase towards the end of the period, culminating in 3,258 deaths in the final week. These insights suggest a relative stability in the impact of Influenza and Pneumonia on overall mortality rates, although the recent increase in Pneumonia deaths could warrant closer monitoring in case it indicates an emerging healthcare concern.
