Over the past 20 weeks, the analysis of respiratory specimens indicates a fluctuating trend in the positivity rate for both Influenza A and B, with an overall average positivity ratio of 6.26%. The data shows a steady decline in the number of specimens tested, which began at 95,973 tests and reduced to 30,331 tests by the end of the period. Notably, the positivity ratio for Influenza A decreased from an initial 0.81% to 0.73%, while Influenza B experienced a more significant drop from 0.27% to 0.38% in the same timeframe. The highest combined positivity ratio of 1.31% occurred in week 16, suggesting a peak in influenza activity during that period. Given these trends, healthcare systems might anticipate a decline in influenza cases but should remain vigilant and prepared for potential fluctuations in infection rates.
