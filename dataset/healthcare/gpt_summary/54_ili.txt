The analysis of the 20-week Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data shows a significant peak in the ratio of ILI patients, surpassing the baseline at one point, which indicates a period of heightened influenza activity. This peak is particularly pronounced in the age group of 5-24, suggesting a higher transmission rate among school-age children and young adults. Following this surge, there has been a steady decline in ILI ratios across all age groups, with the most considerable decrease observed in the youngest age group (0-4), which often represents a vulnerable population in terms of influenza complications. Despite the decline, healthcare providers should remain vigilant as the ILI ratios, although lower, still indicate the presence of influenza in the community. The overall decreasing trend may ease the burden on healthcare resources but warrants continuous monitoring to manage and prevent potential future outbreaks effectively.
