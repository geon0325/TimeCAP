Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable decline in the number of patients presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI), with the ratio of ILI patients consistently remaining below the baseline of 2.9%. All age groups have shown a similar downward trend in ILI incidence, suggesting a widespread reduction in influenza activity across the population. The youngest age group (0-4 years) consistently reported the highest number of ILI cases compared to other age groups, which is a common pattern given their developing immune systems and high rates of transmission in settings such as daycare and preschool. While the overall trend indicates a decrease in ILI cases, healthcare systems should remain vigilant for potential increases as the ratio has shown a slight uptick in recent weeks. Given the consistently low ILI ratios well beneath the baseline, it is likely that resources allocated for ILI could be adjusted accordingly, but with caution to ensure preparedness for any unexpected surge in influenza activity.
