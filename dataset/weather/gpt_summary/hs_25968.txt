Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the later hours of the day. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, with extremely high levels during the cooler early hours, which then dropped substantially as temperatures rose, indicating the presence of moisture that could contribute to a muggy feel. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with only minor variations, suggesting no immediate indication of significant weather fronts or storms moving into the area. Wind speeds were generally light and showed little variation, which, combined with high humidity and rising temperatures, could lead to a sense of stillness and potential discomfort for residents. The wind direction shifted throughout the day but predominantly came from the south to southeast, which is typical for bringing warmer air into the region.
