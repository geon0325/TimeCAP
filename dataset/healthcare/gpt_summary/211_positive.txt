Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a significant increase in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the rate growing from 2.25% to a peak of 30.26% in week 16 before declining to 22.49% in the most recent week. Influenza A has consistently constituted a larger proportion of positive cases compared to Influenza B, peaking at 19.31% in week 17, although its prevalence has also decreased in the latest data to 17.23%. Conversely, Influenza B exhibited a more pronounced peak at 17.59% in week 10, but has seen a relatively steeper decline to 5.27% by the end of the 20-week period. The total number of specimens tested has fluctuated, with a notable increase in testing volume peaking at 72,224 tests in week 15, which may have contributed to the higher number of detected positive cases during the mid to late period of analysis. The observed trends suggest a waning phase of the influenza season, but healthcare systems should remain vigilant, as the number of positive cases for both Influenza A and B still represent a significant burden on healthcare resources.
