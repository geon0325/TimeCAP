Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the mortality ratio of Influenza or Pneumonia relative to total deaths, with a marked peak in the most recent data. The average ratio for the period is 10.43%, which is significantly higher than the historical average of 7.84%. The number of deaths from Influenza or Pneumonia combined spiked dramatically in the final week to 887 from Influenza and 5516 from Pneumonia, deviating from an otherwise gradual increase observed over the preceding weeks. This recent surge in Influenza-related deaths is particularly concerning, representing an increase of over 6000% from the first week to the last. The healthcare system may need to allocate more resources and efforts to manage and investigate the causes of this sudden rise, as it could indicate an emerging public health threat.
