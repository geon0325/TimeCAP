Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia as a proportion of total deaths has shown variability, with a peak of 8.33% in the fourth week and a low of 6.56% in the first week. This fluctuation indicates that the mortality ratio has generally exceeded the average ratio of 7.84%, suggesting a heightened impact of these diseases on overall mortality during this period. The total number of deaths has seen a gradual decline from 61,090 in the fourth week to 54,458 in the last week, while deaths specifically from Influenza or Pneumonia have also decreased from their peaks during this timeframe. The highest number of deaths from Influenza was recorded at 671 in the fourth week, which notably coincides with the peak in the overall mortality ratio. The data implies a potential strain on healthcare resources during the weeks with higher mortality ratios, necessitating ongoing surveillance and possible intervention measures to manage the impact of Influenza and Pneumonia on the healthcare system.
