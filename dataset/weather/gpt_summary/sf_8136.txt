Over the last 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a notable fluctuation in temperature, with a general warming trend during the day followed by a decrease after sunset. Humidity levels experienced significant variation with notably high levels during the cooler early morning hours, dropping substantially during the peak afternoon temperatures, and then rising again during the night. Air pressure remained relatively stable but showed a slight decreasing trend toward the end of the period, which typically suggests an approaching weather system that could lead to changes in weather patterns, including the possibility of precipitation or wind changes. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a peak in intensity observed during the night, and the wind direction varied significantly, indicating the presence of varying air masses influencing the local weather. Overall, the combination of changing air pressure, variable wind directions, and fluctuating humidity levels suggests a dynamic weather situation that could lead to unpredictable weather conditions in the short term.
