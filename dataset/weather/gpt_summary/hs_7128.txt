Over the last 24 hours in Houston, there has been a gradual increase in temperature reaching its peak in the afternoon before stabilizing towards the evening, indicative of typical diurnal warming trends. Humidity showed a reverse correlation with temperature, starting high in the early morning hours and decreasing as temperatures rose, which is common as warmer air can hold more moisture. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase in the middle of the day, suggesting steady weather conditions without the immediate influence of strong weather systems. Wind speeds were consistently light, with very minor fluctuations, indicating a calm wind situation without significant gusts or storms. The wind direction varied but predominantly came from a southerly direction, with a brief shift to a more northwesterly and then westerly direction in the early morning, likely due to a passing weather front or localized pressure changes.
