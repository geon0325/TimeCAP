Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have exhibited a typical diurnal pattern with the warmest conditions observed during the afternoon hours and a gradual cooling trend into the night and early morning. Humidity levels have fluctuated significantly, with a noticeable increase during the night that could be associated with the coastal marine influence, potentially leading to morning fog or dew. Air pressure experienced a couple of marked drops, indicative of transient weather systems passing through the area, which could have resulted in weather instability at those times. Wind conditions have been variable in both speed and direction, with a general trend of moderate speeds that could have been responsible for periods of wind chill, making temperatures feel cooler than they actually were. The wind direction has been predominantly from the west and northwest, which is typical for San Francisco's climate, occasionally shifting, which could influence coastal fog formation and dispersal.
