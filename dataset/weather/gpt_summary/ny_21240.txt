Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature followed by a moderate increase, suggesting a typical diurnal variation pattern. Humidity levels showed a significant decrease during the day, which, along with the reduction in air pressure later on, could indicate the potential approach of a weather system. Air pressure was relatively stable but started to rise sharply, reaching a peak before slightly declining, which often points to fair weather conditions but also the possibility of changing patterns. Wind speeds varied, with a noticeable increase at certain hours, which could have contributed to a wind chill effect, making the air feel colder than the actual temperature. The wind direction was predominantly from the north-western quadrant, shifting significantly later in the period, which might be associated with the movement of weather fronts or changing weather conditions in the region.
