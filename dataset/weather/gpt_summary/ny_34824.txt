Over the last 24 hours in New York City, there has been a noticeable upward trend in temperature, reaching its peak during the latter part of the day before starting to decrease slightly. Humidity levels saw a significant increase in the early morning, indicative of possible early morning fog or dew, before stabilizing and then dropping sharply as temperatures rose, suggesting drier conditions later in the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with only minor fluctuations, which points to steady weather conditions without significant fronts or systems moving through. Wind speeds were consistent and light, showing no signs of gusty conditions that might indicate approaching weather changes. Lastly, the wind direction varied from northerly in the early hours to easterly and then shifted towards the southeast, which could be associated with the movement of air masses and possibly the advection of different air properties into the area.
