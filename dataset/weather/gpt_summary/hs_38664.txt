Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced an upward trend in temperature, particularly during the daytime, which is typical for the region's warm climate. The humidity levels showed considerable fluctuations but remained high for most of the period, indicating a muggy atmosphere that often precedes or accompanies precipitation events. Air pressure gradually increased, suggesting a stable weather pattern setting in, which could lead to clearer skies and less likelihood of storms or rain. Wind speeds were moderate and increased towards the end of the period, with a significant change in wind direction, shifting from predominantly southerly to northerly, which may bring cooler air and a potential change in weather conditions. This shift in wind direction, combined with the increasing pressure and varied humidity, suggests that Houston may be transitioning to a different weather pattern, possibly influenced by a frontal system moving through the area.
