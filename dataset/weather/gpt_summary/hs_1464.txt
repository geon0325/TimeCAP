Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a modest fluctuation in temperature that eventually saw a notable increase, indicating a warm front may have moved through the area. Humidity levels were high in the earlier part of the day, reaching saturation at one point, but significantly dropped as temperatures rose, suggesting the possibility of a dry air mass intrusion. Air pressure remained relatively stable initially but encountered a noticeable dip, followed by a recovery, which could be associated with the passage of a transient weather system. Wind speeds varied, with calm conditions in the early hours and an uptick later on, indicating a change in weather patterns such as the arrival of the aforementioned warm front. The wind direction was predominantly from the south to southeast, but with periods of variability, which could have contributed to the temperature and humidity variations observed in Houston.
