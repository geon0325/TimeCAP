Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a notable warming trend with temperatures reaching well above the typical average for the region, suggesting a possible heat event. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly but showed a tendency to decrease towards the latter part of the day, which could contribute to the perception of even higher temperatures due to drier conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase in the middle of the period, indicating steady weather conditions; however, a noticeable drop towards the end of the period could signal an incoming change in the weather system. Wind speeds were generally light but exhibited a sharp, brief increase at one point, potentially associated with a localized weather phenomenon or a shift in the larger atmospheric pattern. Wind direction varied throughout the day, suggesting the influence of different air masses moving through the area, which could have implications for temperature and humidity trends as well.
