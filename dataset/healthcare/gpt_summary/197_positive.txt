Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable upward trend in the ratio of positive respiratory specimens for influenza, with a significant increase from an initial 2.22% to 10.94% in the latest week, surpassing the 20-week average of 6.26%. Influenza B has shown a more pronounced rise in its positivity ratio, which escalated sharply from 0.96% to 7.89%, indicating a substantial contribution to the overall increase in positive specimens. Meanwhile, Influenza A also experienced a considerable increase but at a slower pace, growing from 1.26% to 3.05%. This surge in influenza activity, particularly the spike in Influenza B cases, could strain healthcare resources, suggesting a need for increased vigilance, vaccination efforts, and possible allocation of additional medical supplies and personnel to manage the rising number of cases. The data indicates a seasonal trend with a peak in the later weeks, which may require healthcare providers to prepare for continued increases in influenza cases in the short term.
