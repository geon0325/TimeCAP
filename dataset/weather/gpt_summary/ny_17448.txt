The humidity levels have shown fluctuations, starting at moderate levels in the early hours, increasing to high levels by morning, and then decreasing significantly towards the late afternoon, suggesting a drier air mass moving into the area. Air pressure has been on a slight but steady decline throughout the day, which could be associated with a weakening high-pressure system that might lead to less stable weather conditions.
