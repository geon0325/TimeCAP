Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a steady increase in the number of patients presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI) across all age groups, with the most substantial rise observed in the youngest (0-4 years) and the working-age population (25-49 years). The proportion of ILI cases in the older age groups (50-64 years and 65 years or more) also increased, albeit at a slower rate compared to the younger cohorts. The ratio of ILI patients has consistently risen, surpassing the baseline of 2.9% in the final week, suggesting a potential outbreak that could strain healthcare resources if the trend continues. This uptick may necessitate increased surveillance, vaccine campaigns, and public health interventions tailored to the most affected age groups. The escalating prevalence of ILI cases might lead to a higher demand for medical care, including hospitalizations and emergency visits, especially among the vulnerable elderly population and the highly active young and middle-aged adults.
