The time-series data on Influenza-like Illness (ILI) over the last 20 weeks reveals a declining trend in the ratio of ILI patients, indicating a decrease in the prevalence of ILI symptoms among the population. Initially, the ratio of ILI patients was significantly above the baseline, suggesting an elevated ILI activity across age groups. However, recent weeks show the ratio falling below the baseline, signifying a potential easing of the ILI burden on healthcare systems. Notably, the highest number of ILI cases were consistently reported in the younger age groups (0-4 and 5-24 years), which might indicate higher transmission rates or susceptibility within these demographics. The descending trend in ILI cases, if it continues, could lead to reduced healthcare resource utilization and a shift in focus towards other healthcare priorities.
