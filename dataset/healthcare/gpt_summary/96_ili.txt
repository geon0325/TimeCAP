Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a fluctuating but overall increasing trend in the number of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases across all age groups. The ratio of ILI patients started below the baseline and showed a significant rise in the subsequent weeks, surpassing the baseline and reaching a peak before slightly declining towards the end of the observed period. Notably, the age group 5-24 exhibited a marked increase in ILI cases, which could suggest higher transmission rates or increased susceptibility in this demographic. The sustained levels above the baseline ratio point towards an active influenza season, which may place additional strain on healthcare resources and necessitate targeted public health interventions. It's important for healthcare providers and policymakers to monitor these trends closely to manage the potential impact on the healthcare system, including considerations for vaccination strategies and resource allocation.
