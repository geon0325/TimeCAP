Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a slight decline in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia in comparison to the overall death count, with the ratio starting at 6.03% and ending at 6.18%, remaining consistently below the average of 7.84%. The total number of deaths fluctuated modestly, with a peak at week 14 (59727 deaths), while the number of deaths specifically attributed to influenza saw a notable decrease, from 106 in week 1 to 12 in week 20. Pneumonia-related deaths also exhibited a downward trend, with the initial count of 3310 dropping to 3573 by the end of the period. This sustained decrease in both influenza and pneumonia mortality rates could indicate an effective response to seasonal outbreaks or improvements in prevention and treatment strategies. However, the persistently lower-than-average ratio suggests that other causes of mortality may be concurrently rising or that there may be shifts in the patterns of morbidity and mortality within the population.
