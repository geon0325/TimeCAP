Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature with a general trend of cooling followed by a warming period towards the latter part of the day. Humidity levels experienced some variation, with notable peaks that suggest the presence of moisture in the air, potentially leading to fog or mist, especially during the early morning or nighttime. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight decrease towards the end of the observed period, which could signal a change in the current weather pattern or the approach of a new weather system. Wind speeds were mostly light and variable, which is typical for the region and unlikely to result in significant wind-related impacts. The wind direction shifted throughout the day, with some periods of more northerly and easterly winds, which might have influenced local temperature and humidity patterns.
