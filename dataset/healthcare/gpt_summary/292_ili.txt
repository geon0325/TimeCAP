Over the past 20 weeks, the ratio of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) patients has consistently remained below the baseline of 2.9%, suggesting that the ILI incidence is within expected levels. However, there has been a gradual increase in the ILI ratio, indicating a slight upward trend in ILI cases. The age group 25-49 consistently reported the highest number of ILI cases, which may reflect higher transmission rates or increased susceptibility within this demographic. Notably, even the oldest age group (65 or more) showed a rising trend in ILI cases, which is concerning given their potential for more severe illness. Healthcare providers should monitor these trends closely, as continued increases could strain healthcare resources and warrant public health interventions.
