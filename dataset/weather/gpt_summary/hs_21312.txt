Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has shown a gradual increase, indicating a warming trend. Humidity levels have remained consistently high, suggesting a heavy and possibly oppressive atmosphere that could lead to a perception of it being warmer than the actual temperature indicates. Air pressure has been decreasing over this period, which could be indicative of an approaching weather system that may lead to changes such as precipitation or storms. Wind speeds have been relatively steady, with a slight increase noted, while wind direction has gradually shifted from easterly to southeasterly, which could be bringing in moisture from the Gulf, possibly affecting local weather conditions. The combination of these factors points towards a likely increase in cloud cover or the development of rain, with the potential for a muggy and uncomfortable outdoor environment.
