Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable upward trend in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the ratio of positive specimens increasing from 1.51% to 18.53%. During this period, the number of specimens tested weekly rose, peaking at 38,052 in the final week, indicating heightened surveillance efforts. Influenza A has been predominant, with its ratio peaking at 16.50% in the penultimate week, while Influenza B also showed an increase, reaching a ratio of 2.09% in the last week. The substantial increase in the ratio of positive specimens, particularly for Influenza A, suggests a significant influenza activity, which could place additional burden on healthcare resources. As the influenza season progresses, healthcare systems may need to allocate more resources for patient care and vaccination efforts to manage the increased demand.
