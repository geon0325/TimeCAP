Over the last 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, beginning with cooler conditions that warmed up as the day progressed. Humidity levels showed significant variation, with notable peaks indicating the possibility of fog or mist, especially when humidity reached saturation. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with a slight increase towards the end of the 24-hour timeframe, suggesting steady weather conditions may persist. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate and predominantly from the north to northeast direction, with some variability in direction, but no significant gusts or strong wind events were observed. The combination of rising temperatures, variable humidity, and steady pressure indicates that there were no extreme weather events, but the high humidity levels at certain times could have led to periods of reduced visibility or damp conditions.
