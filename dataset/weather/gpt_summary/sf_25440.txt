Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable fluctuation in temperature, with a clear warming trend followed by a slight cooling period towards the end of the observed timeframe. Humidity levels varied widely, indicating the presence of different air masses and possibly the passing of a weather front during this period. Air pressure showed a general decreasing trend, suggesting that the area might have been influenced by an approaching low-pressure system, which can lead to unsettled weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, but there was an increase in wind speed in the latter part of the period, which could contribute to a wind chill effect and increased wave activity along the coast. Wind direction was variable, predominantly coming from the north and west, which is typical for San Francisco and may indicate the passage of a weather system moving in from the Pacific Ocean.
