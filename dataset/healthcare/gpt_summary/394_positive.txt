Over the last 20 weeks, the total number of respiratory specimens tested for influenza has fluctuated, peaking at 55,332 in the final week. The percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza initially increased, reaching a high of 1.31% in week 6, but has since demonstrated a downward trend to 0.70% in the last week, which is below the 20-week average of 1.0%. Influenza A showed an early increase in the positivity rate, peaking at 0.88% in week 11, but ended at 0.47% in week 20, while Influenza B cases have consistently decreased from a peak of 0.78% in week 4 to 0.23% in week 20. This declining trend in positivity rates for both Influenza A and B suggests a decrease in influenza activity, which could indicate an easing burden on healthcare resources dedicated to influenza. However, consistent monitoring is essential to detect any potential resurgence, especially during typical flu seasons or in the context of co-circulation with other respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2.
