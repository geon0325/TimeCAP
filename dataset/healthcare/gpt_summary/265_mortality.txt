Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable decrease in the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, with the percentage falling from 16.41% to 6.31%. This decline suggests a significant reduction in deaths attributable to these respiratory conditions amidst the overall mortality figures. Despite this trend, the mortality ratio has seen a slight increase in recent weeks, from a low of 5.81% to 6.31%, indicating a potential uptick in Influenza or Pneumonia-related deaths. The absolute number of deaths from pneumonia has also decreased substantially from 13,234 to 3,565 over the observed period, while influenza-related deaths have remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations. This observed trend could signal an improvement in the management and prevention of Pneumonia, though the recent increase in the mortality ratio may require close monitoring by healthcare providers and policymakers to address any resurgence in these respiratory diseases.
