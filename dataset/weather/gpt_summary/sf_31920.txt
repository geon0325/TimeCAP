Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature with a general cooling trend during the night that reversed with a warming trend during the daylight hours. Humidity levels varied, with a notable increase during the early morning hours, which is typical due to the decrease in temperature, but then a significant drop occurred in the afternoon, indicating drier conditions that might have been more comfortable for outdoor activities. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with a slight increase observed, suggesting a stable weather pattern without the immediate prospect of significant weather changes such as storms. The wind speed was mostly moderate but showed signs of variability, with occasional increases that might have led to brisk conditions, particularly in exposed areas. Wind direction was predominantly westerly, which is characteristic of San Francisco's maritime climate and could have contributed to the coastal city's temperature moderation and the transport of marine air inland.
