Over the last 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have shown a gradual increase, indicating a warming trend that peaked during the late afternoon hours before stabilizing. Relative humidity levels have generally decreased concurrently with rising temperatures, suggesting more comfortable conditions and possibly lower chances of precipitation. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with only minor fluctuations, which is indicative of steady weather patterns without the immediate presence of strong frontal systems. Wind speeds were consistent, showing no significant changes, and thus not likely to impact short-term weather conditions substantially. The wind direction was predominantly from the south-southeast, which is typical for this region and may have contributed to the slight increase in temperature by bringing in warmer air masses.
