Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a notable increase in temperature, peaking during the afternoon hours, indicative of typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels have fluctuated significantly, starting relatively low but spiking in the early morning, possibly due to overnight cooling and condensation, before gradually decreasing as temperatures rose. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase toward the middle of the period, which could suggest a transient high-pressure system affecting the area. Wind speeds were mostly gentle to moderate, with a slight increase in the late hours, while wind direction varied, suggesting a changing weather pattern, including periods of calm. The combination of increasing temperature, variable humidity, and stable pressure with shifting winds could lead to comfortable but potentially changeable weather conditions for Houston.
