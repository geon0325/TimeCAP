Over the last 24 hours in New York City, there has been a slight decrease in temperature, indicating a cooling trend. Humidity levels fluctuated, but notably increased during cooler temperatures, which is typical due to the inverse relationship between temperature and humidity. Air pressure has been gradually decreasing, which could suggest an approaching weather system that may result in unsettled weather conditions. Wind speeds varied, with some hours experiencing calmer winds and others more gusty conditions; the wind was predominantly coming from northerly directions, occasionally shifting to a more easterly or northerly flow. The combination of the cooling trend, increasing humidity, and decreasing air pressure could lead to cloudier skies and a potential for precipitation in the near future.
