Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has experienced a downward trend, declining from an initial high of 4507.66 to a low of 4273.53 before making a slight recovery to close at 4299.70, indicating increased market volatility which is also reflected in the VIX index's rise from 13.57 to 17.34. The Nikkei 225 mirrored this volatility, with an initial rise to 33241.02 followed by a decrease to 31872.52, showing signs of sell-off in the Japanese market. The FTSE 100, however, showed relative resilience, with an overall upward trend moving from 7439.10 to 7601.90, suggesting stronger investor confidence in the UK market. Gold futures saw a decrease from 1938.20 to 1860.40, which typically indicates a shift by investors towards riskier assets; however, the broader market downturn suggests a more complex interplay of market forces. Currency markets showed a strengthening USD with the EUR/USD pair falling from 1.09 to 1.05 and the USD strengthening against the JPY from 146.10 to 149.50, while the USD/CNY pair remained relatively stable, ending at 7.31, suggesting the potential for increased import costs for the US and complexities in international trade dynamics.
