Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature, generally maintaining a mild and comfortable range. Humidity levels have varied significantly, with some peaks that suggest the presence of moisture in the air, potentially leading to foggy conditions, especially during the early hours. Air pressure has seen a dramatic drop in the later period, which could be indicative of an approaching weather system, possibly leading to unsettled weather conditions. Wind speeds have been mostly light to moderate, with no significant gusts, and the wind direction has been variable, although a consistent pattern from the south to south-west has been observed in the later hours. This combination of dropping air pressure and consistent wind direction could signal a change in weather patterns, perhaps the approach of a new frontal system.
