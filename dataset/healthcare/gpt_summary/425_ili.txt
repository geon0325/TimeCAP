Over the last 20 weeks, the percentage of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases amongst the total patient count has been consistently below the 2.9% severity benchmark, indicating a relatively mild influenza season to date. There has been a noticeable decline in ILI cases across all age groups, with the steepest reduction observed in the youngest age bracket (0-4 years), suggesting a decrease in transmission or reporting among this demographic. The ILI percentage peaked in the initial weeks at 2.44% and has steadily decreased to 1.20% by the 20th week, highlighting a downward trend in ILI prevalence. Despite the overall decrease, the age group 25-49 showed a slight uptick in ILI cases in the last recorded week, warranting close monitoring for any potential reversal of trends. The consistent below-benchmark levels of ILI cases suggest that the healthcare system is not currently strained by influenza, but continuous surveillance is necessary to promptly address any changes in the ILI patterns.
