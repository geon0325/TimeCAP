Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have experienced a notable diurnal variation, with a warming trend observed in the daytime, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before gradually cooling towards the early morning hours. Humidity levels have fluctuated significantly, with the highest humidity occurring in the early morning, which is typical due to cooler overnight temperatures and potential coastal fog, but then dropping substantially during the warmer, sunnier afternoon hours. Air pressure has been relatively stable, showing only minor variations, which suggests a steady weather pattern without the immediate approach of any significant weather fronts. Wind speeds have been mostly gentle to moderate, with periods of calm, especially during the night, and prevailing winds have shown variable directions, shifting from northerly to easterly and then to southerly, which may indicate the passage of localized weather systems. The combination of these factors points to a typical pattern of coastal weather for San Francisco, with no immediate indication of severe weather conditions.
