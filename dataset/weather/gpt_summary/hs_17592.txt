Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak during the later hours of the day, indicative of a typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels showed a slight fluctuation, with higher values during the cooler early morning hours, which decreased as temperatures rose, suggesting a common inverse relationship between temperature and humidity. Air pressure has been on a slight but steady decline throughout the period, which could be associated with a gradual shift in weather patterns, potentially leading to changing weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate and have slightly increased towards the current hour, while wind direction was predominantly from the southeast, which is consistent with Houston's prevailing winds and could contribute to the transport of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. These combined factors indicate relatively stable weather conditions but with the decreasing air pressure, there might be a chance for changing weather patterns in the near future.
