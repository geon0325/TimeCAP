Over the last 20 weeks, the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia to the total number of deaths has shown fluctuations but remained mostly below the 20-week average of 7.84%. The highest ratio was observed in the most recent week at 6.98%, which, while showing an upward trend from the previous weeks, is still below the overall average. The total number of deaths peaked at 63,265 in the last week, with deaths from Influenza and Pneumonia also showing an increase to 204 and 4,213, respectively, indicating a possible seasonal surge. The lowest ratios were seen mid-series at 5.70% and 5.78%, correlating with the lowest total deaths of 24,395 in the 10th week, suggesting a possible reduction in respiratory infections or improved management during that period. Healthcare systems must remain vigilant, as the recent upward trend in mortality ratios may signal a need for increased preventive measures, vaccination, and resource allocation to manage a potential rise in Influenza and Pneumonia cases.
