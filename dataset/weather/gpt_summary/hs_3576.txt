Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, reaching its lowest point during the early morning hours before rising significantly in the afternoon. Humidity levels showed significant variation, with a peak in the early morning coinciding with the lowest temperatures and dropping sharply as temperatures rose later in the day. Air pressure saw a notable increase midday, suggesting the potential influence of a high-pressure system moving through the area, which subsequently stabilized towards the evening. Wind speeds were generally light but increased towards the end of the period, with a notable shift in direction indicating a change in the prevailing weather system. The wind direction varied from northerly to easterly and then predominantly northwesterly as the day progressed, which could have contributed to the fluctuating temperature and humidity levels experienced in Houston.
