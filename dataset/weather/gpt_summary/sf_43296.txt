Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperature experienced a noticeable diurnal fluctuation, with a warming trend peaking in the late afternoon hours, indicative of clear skies and strong solar heating. Relative humidity levels inversely followed the temperature curve, with the highest humidity occurring during the cooler early morning hours and dropping significantly as temperatures rose. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable with a slight decrease noted towards the end of the period, which could suggest the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds were generally light with a few moderate gusts, and wind direction varied significantly throughout the day, suggesting a lack of a dominant weather front. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and falling pressure may lead to the development of local weather phenomena such as sea breezes or fog, particularly along coastal areas.
