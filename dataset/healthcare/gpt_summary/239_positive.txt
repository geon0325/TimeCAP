Over the last 20 weeks, the testing of respiratory specimens has shown an overall low prevalence of influenza, with an average positive rate of 6.26%, but with fluctuations in the weekly ratios. Both Influenza A and B are present, yet Influenza B has shown a higher peak positivity rate of 0.22% in the most recent week, compared to the highest Influenza A peak of 0.18% in week 2. There is a notable increase in positive specimens for both Influenza A and B in the last recorded week, with rates jumping to 0.17% and 0.22% respectively, indicating a potential uptick in influenza activity. The ratio of positive specimens has reached its highest at 0.40% in the 20th week, suggesting an upward trend that could pose challenges if it continues. Healthcare resources may need to be adjusted to accommodate potential increases in influenza cases, as suggested by the recent data trends.
