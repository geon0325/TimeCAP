Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a general uptrend, rising from 4293.93 to 4398.95, which suggests a positive sentiment amongst investors. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, has remained relatively low with a slight increase towards the end of the period, indicating that while the market has been calm, there may be increasing uncertainty or expected fluctuations. The Nikkei 225 initially rose, reflecting optimism in the Asian markets, but later experienced a decline, possibly due to profit-taking or shifting investor sentiment, ending lower at 32388.42 from a peak of 33502.42. Both Gold and Crude Oil Futures have seen price increases, suggesting that investors may be hedging against potential inflation or market instability. The exchange rates have remained relatively stable, with the EUR/USD and USD/CNY showing slight movements, while the USD/JPY experienced a noticeable appreciation, which could impact export-driven sectors in Japan.
