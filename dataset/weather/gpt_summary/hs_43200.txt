Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have shown a cyclical pattern with a peak during the daytime and a decrease at night, indicative of normal diurnal variation. Humidity levels have fluctuated significantly, reaching saturation at one point, which could have led to fog or mist formation, especially when combined with lower nighttime temperatures. Air pressure has remained relatively stable with a slight increase over the period, suggesting steady weather conditions without the immediate approach of any major weather systems. Wind speeds have been mostly gentle to moderate but experienced some variability, with occasional higher gusts that could affect loose objects and potentially impact outdoor activities. The prevailing wind direction has been variable, with a general tendency to shift, which is typical for inland areas where local landforms and temperature gradients can influence wind patterns.
