Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a significant decline in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the initial ratio of positive specimens at 24.47% dropping to 0.95% in the most recent week. The number of specimens tested has decreased over time, suggesting potential seasonal variability or a reduction in the prevalence of influenza-like illness prompting testing. The data shows a consistent decline in Influenza A cases, which contributed the most to the overall positivity rate, with its peak at 24.34% and falling to 0.41%. In contrast, Influenza B has remained a minor contributor to the overall positivity rate, with a slight increase in its ratio from 0.12% to 0.54% over the period, indicating a potential shift in the dominant influenza strain. The overall downward trend is positive for the healthcare system, likely leading to reduced hospitalization and resource allocation towards influenza; however, the slight increase in Influenza B's ratio warrants continued surveillance.
