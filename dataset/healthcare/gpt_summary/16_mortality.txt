Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable decline in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia in comparison to the total number of deaths, starting at 6.66% and decreasing to a low of 5.36%, before a slight increase to 5.56% in the final week. The absolute number of deaths from pneumonia has also decreased from 3458 to 2825, while deaths from influenza have seen a significant drop from 90 in the first week to 12 in the last week. Despite the overall decline, the ratio experienced a slight resurgence in the last two recorded weeks, which could indicate a potential uptick in Influenza or Pneumonia-related mortality. The average mortality ratio for the 20-week period stands at 5.94%, which is below the historical average of 7.84%, suggesting a better control or lower impact of these conditions during this timeframe. This trend could signal an improvement in prevention and treatment strategies for Influenza and Pneumonia but warrants continued monitoring for any signs of reversal that could strain healthcare resources.
