Over the past 20 market days, the S&P 500 has exhibited a downward trend, closing lower at 4008.01 from an opening of 4462.21, indicating a bearish market sentiment. Concurrently, the VIX, a measure of market volatility, showed heightened levels, peaking at 34.75, which corresponds to the increased uncertainty and risk aversion among investors. International markets reflected similar trends, with the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 experiencing volatility, but the FTSE 100 recovered slightly towards the end, suggesting regional market variations. Gold futures, traditionally seen as a safe haven, declined from 1955.70 to 1813.50, indicating that investors might be seeking liquidity or other defensive positions. Crude oil futures rose sharply to 114.20 from an opening at 102.56, which could signal future inflationary pressures, while the weakening of the EUR/USD and USD/JPY exchange rates suggest a strengthening dollar amidst global market uncertainty.
