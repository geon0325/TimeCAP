International markets reflected mixed sentiments, with Japan's Nikkei 225 showing volatility but ending slightly lower, and the UK's FTSE 100 demonstrating a stronger uptrend, closing at 7080.50 from an initial 6923.20. Gold Futures saw a consistent rise in value, indicating a possible move by investors towards safe-haven assets amidst market uncertainties.
