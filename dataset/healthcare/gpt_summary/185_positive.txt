Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a fluctuation in the prevalence of influenza with the overall percentage of positive specimens being 6.26%, peaking at 5.84% in week one and hitting a low of 1.90% in week nine. The ratio of specimens testing positive for Influenza A has decreased from 4.17% to 1.15%, while Influenza B showed an increase from 1.67% to 1.95% over the same period. Notably, the ratio of positive tests for Influenza B more than doubled from week nine to the final week, suggesting a late-season surge that could place a strain on healthcare resources. Despite the overall decrease in positive specimens for Influenza A, the consistent presence of both strains A and B highlights the need for continued surveillance and influenza vaccination efforts. The data also suggests that the healthcare system should be prepared for potential fluctuations in influenza cases and the associated impacts on healthcare service demand.
