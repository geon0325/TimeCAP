Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a marked decline in the ratio of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, decreasing from a peak of 26.03% in week 4 to 2.79% in week 20. During the same period, the number of specimens tested decreased by 71.45%, suggesting a possible seasonal decline in influenza activity or a reduction in testing. Influenza A has been the predominant strain throughout the time frame, with its positive specimen ratio peaking at 25.36% in week 5 and falling to 1.14% by week 20, while Influenza B has maintained a smaller and more stable presence, peaking at 1.85% in week 13. The overall downward trend in positive cases, despite a decrease in testing, indicates a possible waning of the influenza season, which could lessen the burden on healthcare resources. However, continuous monitoring is essential as any uptick in positive influenza cases could signal a resurgence, necessitating preparedness in the healthcare system for potential increases in patient volume.
