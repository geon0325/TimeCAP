Over the past 24 hours in New York City, temperatures experienced a modest fluctuation, with a general cooling trend overnight followed by a gradual increase during the day before stabilizing towards the evening. Humidity levels varied significantly, starting at moderate values before dipping to much lower levels and then returning to a moderate range, suggesting a transition in air masses affecting the area. Air pressure remained relatively stable, indicating a period of calm weather, though there was a slight downward trend towards the end of the period which could signal a change in weather patterns. Wind speeds were mostly light, with some increase in intensity during the later hours, and wind directions were predominantly from the south, with occasional variability that included periods of calm. Overall, the consistent air pressure and mild wind conditions suggest stable weather for the immediate future, but the changes in humidity and slight drop in air pressure may hint at an incoming weather system.
