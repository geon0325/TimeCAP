Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has exhibited volatility with a general downtrend, falling from 4588.96 to 4405.71, which may indicate increased investor caution or a response to underlying economic concerns. Correspondingly, the VIX, which measures market volatility, has fluctuated but ended slightly higher, suggesting that investor uncertainty remains elevated. In international markets, the Nikkei 225 has also shown a decline, though with some recovery towards the end, while the FTSE 100 has remained relatively more stable with minor fluctuations, ending slightly lower than its starting point. Commodity prices have seen some declines, with Gold Futures retreating from 1970.50 to 1911.10, and Crude Oil Futures decreasing overall, despite some intermittent rises, indicating potential concerns over global demand. Currency markets have seen the USD strengthen against the JPY and the CNY, while the EUR/USD exchange rate has remained largely flat with a slight weakening of the Euro, which could reflect a stronger perceived outlook for the US economy relative to its peers or differing monetary policy expectations.
