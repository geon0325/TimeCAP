Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable increase in the proportion of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the total ratio of positive specimens escalating from 1.00% to 5.97%, significantly surpassing the 20-week average of 6.26%. Influenza A has been more prevalent than Influenza B, with its positive specimen ratio rising from 0.61% to 4.55%, indicating a marked increase in cases. Meanwhile, Influenza B also showed an upward trend but with a smaller rise from 0.39% to 1.42%. The total number of specimens tested peaked at 100,657 in week 19, coinciding with the highest recorded number of positive Influenza A specimens (3,647) during the period. This upward trend in influenza cases could indicate the onset of a more severe flu season, potentially increasing the burden on healthcare resources and necessitating enhanced surveillance and preventive measures.
