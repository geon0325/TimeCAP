Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a slight downtrend, starting from 4409.53 and closing at 4478.03, indicating a period of uncertainty and potential caution among investors. The VIX, commonly known as the fear gauge, has increased from 15.07 to 17.10, suggesting that market volatility has heightened and investor sentiment could be turning toward risk aversion. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have also experienced some fluctuations; however, the Nikkei 225 ended this period with a slight gain, while the FTSE 100 showed more resilience with a more significant upward trend, signaling stronger investor confidence in the UK market.

Commodity prices have seen mixed movements, with Gold Futures slightly increasing over the period, which may imply a hedge against market volatility, while Crude Oil Futures have demonstrated a steady increase from $72.99 to $82.82, indicating potential inflationary pressures or geopolitical concerns affecting oil supply. Exchange rates have remained relatively stable, with minor fluctuations in EUR/USD, USD/JPY, and USD/CNY pairs, suggesting that currency markets are not experiencing drastic shifts, but still require monitoring for signs of economic changes or policy adjustments.
