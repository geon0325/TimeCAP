The VIX, often referred to as the "fear index," has experienced fluctuations but ended higher at 20.00 compared to the starting point of 19.46, suggesting increased market volatility. International markets have seen mixed movements with Japan's Nikkei 225 initially falling but recovering towards the end, while the UK's FTSE 100 has steadily climbed, ending higher at 7146.90, reflecting resilience in the European region. Gold Futures have marginally decreased, indicating a potential shift in investor preference towards riskier assets or confidence in the market's ability to manage current challenges. Both the energy sector and currency exchange rates have seen volatility; Crude Oil Futures have increased notably, suggesting higher energy costs ahead, while the exchange rates of EUR/USD and USD/JPY have remained relatively stable, with a slight weakening of the USD against the JPY, which could impact international trade dynamics.
