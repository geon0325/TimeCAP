Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a general uptrend, increasing from 4423.15 to 4528.79, indicating a bullish market sentiment. The VIX, which measures market volatility, has decreased slightly from 18.04 to 16.19, suggesting that investors are feeling more confident, as lower volatility typically indicates less fear in the market. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 have been relatively volatile with some fluctuations, but both indices closed the 20-day period slightly up, suggesting cautious optimism in these markets.

Gold Futures experienced a dip mid-period, touching a low of 1723.40, but have since recovered to 1809.00, which may indicate a flight to safety or inflationary concerns among investors. Crude Oil Futures gradually increased from 70.56 to 69.21, which could signal a recovering demand or tightening supply, potentially impacting inflation and economic recovery. The currency markets showed the EUR/USD and the USD/JYP remaining fairly stable, which suggests that there are no immediate shocks expected in these currency pairs, while the USD/CNY pair showed minor fluctuations, ending the period almost unchanged, hinting at a stable outlook for trade between the United States and China.
