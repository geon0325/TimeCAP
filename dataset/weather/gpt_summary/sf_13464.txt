Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a moderate fluctuation in temperature, with a cooling trend overnight that transitioned into a warming trend during the day. Humidity levels remained relatively stable, with a slight increase during the coolest hours, which is typical as cooler air can hold less moisture before reaching saturation. Air pressure varied slightly but showed a general decrease, suggesting the possibility of changing weather patterns or the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds were mostly light, with occasional moderate gusts, and wind direction varied significantly throughout the day, indicating the presence of variable and possibly unsettled weather conditions. The combination of decreasing air pressure and varying wind directions could imply that residents and visitors in San Francisco should prepare for potential changes in weather, including the increased likelihood of precipitation or fog.
