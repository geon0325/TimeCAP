Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before slowly declining towards the evening. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuation, with a notable spike to saturation around dawn, which likely contributed to early morning fog or mist, followed by a steady decrease throughout the day, indicative of drier conditions by late afternoon. Air pressure showed a slight downward trend, suggesting the possibility of a developing weather system that could affect the region. Wind speeds remained relatively light with some variability, but there was a significant shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly and then to easterly, which could signal a change in weather patterns. Overall, these conditions suggest a typical warm and humid day for Houston, with potential for atmospheric instability as indicated by the declining air pressure.
