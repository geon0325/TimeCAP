Over the last 20 weeks, the data demonstrates a significant peak in Influenza-like Illness (ILI) that exceeded the baseline threshold, particularly in the early weeks, indicating a substantial outbreak period. The age group of 25-49 experienced the most dramatic increase in ILI cases during this peak, which could suggest higher transmission or susceptibility in this demographic. Following the peak, there was a notable decline in ILI cases across all age groups, with the current ratio of ILI patients falling below the baseline, indicating a return towards normal levels. The youngest (0-4 years) and school-age (5-24 years) groups initially had the highest numbers of ILI patients, which could have implications for pediatric healthcare resources and school health policies. However, as the current trend shows a decrease in ILI percentages, the immediate strain on the healthcare system appears to be easing, but continued surveillance is necessary to monitor for potential resurgences.
