Over the last 24 hours in New York City, there has been a slight decrease in temperature, indicating a cooling trend. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly and reached saturation at one point, which could have led to fog or mist conditions, especially when combined with low wind speeds. Air pressure experienced minor fluctuations but remained relatively stable, suggesting steady weather conditions without major systems moving through the area. Wind speeds were generally light to calm, with a few periods of gentle breeze, which would not contribute significantly to wind chill or the dispersal of any precipitation. Wind direction varied widely throughout the period, suggesting the presence of variable and possibly unsettled local air currents.
