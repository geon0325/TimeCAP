Over the last 20 weeks, the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data has exhibited a gradual increase in the ratio of ILI patients across all age groups, with a notable rise as the weeks progressed, eventually exceeding the baseline ratio considered indicative of a significant influenza situation. The youngest age group (0-4 years) consistently showed the highest increase in ILI cases, followed by the 25-49 and 5-24 age brackets, suggesting that children and younger adults are currently the most affected populations. The age groups of 50-64 and 65 or more, while also experiencing an upward trend, reported fewer cases in comparison to the younger age groups. The overall number of patients presented a fluctuating yet upward trajectory, pointing to a potential strain on healthcare resources due to the increasing ILI activity. Considering the current trends, healthcare providers may need to prepare for heightened demand for medical care and possibly consider initiating public health interventions to mitigate the spread of ILI.
