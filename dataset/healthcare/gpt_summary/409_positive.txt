Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a significant upward trend in both the number and percentage of positive respiratory specimens for influenza, with a notable increase in the latter half of the observed period. The ratio of positive specimens has more than doubled from the 20-week average of 6.26% to 17.38% in the most recent week, indicating a substantial rise in influenza prevalence. Influenza A has been the dominant strain, with its positivity rate escalating from 0.51% to 14.36%, while Influenza B also saw a considerable increase from 0.35% to 3.02%. The sharp rise in influenza cases, particularly in the recent weeks, is likely to put additional strain on healthcare resources, necessitating increased vigilance and potentially impacting vaccination and treatment strategies. The data suggests a growing need for public health interventions to mitigate the spread of influenza and manage the rising healthcare demand.
