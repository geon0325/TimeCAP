Over the past 24 hours in New York City, there has been a gradual decrease in temperature, transitioning from mild to cooler conditions. Humidity experienced a significant drop, indicating a shift towards drier air, which often brings clearer skies and less precipitation. Air pressure has been steadily rising, suggesting the strengthening of a high-pressure system that is typically associated with stable and calm weather conditions. Wind speeds varied, with periods of stronger gusts interspersed with calmer intervals, and predominantly came from a southerly direction, shifting to westerly and later to southwesterly, which could influence temperature fluctuations and weather patterns. The combination of increasing pressure, decreasing humidity, and variable winds suggests the likelihood of fair weather in the short term, with a potential for cooler temperatures due to the observed downward temperature trend.
