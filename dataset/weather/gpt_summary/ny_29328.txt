Over the past 24 hours in New York City, temperatures have experienced a gradual increase, indicating a warming trend that peaked in the late afternoon before slightly cooling down towards the evening. Humidity levels have fluctuated significantly, with instances of very high humidity, especially in the early hours, potentially hinting at fog or mist formation during those times. Air pressure has been steadily rising, which generally suggests stable weather conditions are prevailing or approaching. Wind speeds have been mostly gentle to moderate, with some increase in speed observed later in the day, while the wind direction has been variable, shifting predominantly from northwestern to southern directions throughout the period. This combination of rising temperatures, variable humidity, steady air pressure, and changing wind patterns could mean New Yorkers experienced a mix of clear and possibly misty conditions with a gradual transition to more stable and drier weather by the end of the observed period.
