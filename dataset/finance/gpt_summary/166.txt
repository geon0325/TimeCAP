Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a slight overall upward trend, moving from 2924.58 to 2977.62, though with some volatility in between, suggesting a cautiously optimistic stock market sentiment. In contrast, the VIX, a measure of market volatility, has fluctuated but ended slightly lower than its starting point, indicating that while there is some uncertainty, it has not escalated significantly. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 indices have both experienced a general increase, which may point to strengthening international markets, particularly in Asia and Europe. Gold Futures have seen some volatility but remained relatively stable, closing at 1507.50 compared to an opening of 1526.50, which can be interpreted as investors maintaining a hedge against potential market downturns. Finally, the exchange rates show a marginal weakening of the USD against the JPY and CNY, with no significant change against the EUR, suggesting a mixed view on the strength of the US dollar.
