Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have exhibited a slight upward trend, indicating a mild warming pattern throughout the city. Humidity levels have varied significantly, hitting saturation at times and then dropping, which could have led to periods of fog or mist, especially during the early hours when temperatures were at their lowest. Air pressure experienced a gradual increase followed by a slight decrease, suggesting a stable weather pattern with no immediate signs of major weather disturbances. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate but increased towards the end of the period, which could disperse any coastal fog and bring clearer conditions. The wind direction varied, with some consistency in coming from the south to southeast, which is typical for this region's weather patterns and could influence coastal temperatures and cloud cover.
