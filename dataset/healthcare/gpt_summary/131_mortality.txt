Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a slight upward trend in the mortality ratio of deaths from influenza or pneumonia compared to total deaths, increasing from 5.36% to 5.85%, though it remains below the average ratio of 7.84%. The number of deaths from pneumonia has been consistently higher than those from influenza, with pneumonia-related deaths peaking at 3,178 in the final week. Influenza mortality started low but showed a gradual increase over the period, ending with 31 deaths in the last week, its highest point. The total number of deaths fluctuated throughout the 20 weeks, with an overall increase towards the end, reaching a high of 54,847 deaths in the last recorded week. These trends suggest a growing burden on the healthcare system from respiratory illnesses, which may require increased resource allocation to manage the rise in influenza and pneumonia cases.
