Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before slightly decreasing towards the evening. The humidity levels showed a significant decrease through the afternoon, indicative of drier air moving into the area, which coincided with the peak temperatures. Air pressure has been relatively stable but showed a slight downward trend, suggesting a potential change in weather patterns or the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate with some variability, and the predominant wind direction was northerly, with a brief shift to easterly before returning to a northerly flow. These conditions are typical for a warm and relatively stable weather pattern, but the slight decrease in pressure could signal an upcoming change in the weather.
