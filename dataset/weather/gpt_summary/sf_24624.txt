Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a noticeable drop in temperature from its peak during the day to a cooler night, indicative of the typical diurnal temperature variation. The humidity levels fluctuated significantly, suggesting variable atmospheric moisture that could contribute to changes in cloud cover and the potential for fog, particularly given the city's coastal location. Air pressure showed a rising trend throughout most of the day, stabilizing at a higher value before a sharp decrease, which could signal an approaching weather system that may alter the current conditions. Wind speeds varied, with some gustier periods, while the wind direction shifted predominantly between westerly and northerly, reflecting the influence of both land-sea interactions and larger-scale weather patterns. Overall, these indicators point to fairly typical weather dynamics for San Francisco, with the recent decrease in air pressure being the most notable feature that could presage changes in the near-term weather outlook.
