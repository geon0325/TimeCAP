Humidity levels remained relatively high throughout the day, suggesting a persistent level of moisture in the air, which could contribute to a feeling of mugginess and potentially lead to morning fog typical of the region. Air pressure showed a steady increase, reflecting a trend towards more stable weather conditions and possibly clearer skies. Wind speeds varied, with a period of calm followed by a sharp increase in the evening, which could lead to cooler night-time temperatures if the trend persists.
