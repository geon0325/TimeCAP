Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a significant fluctuation in the rate of positive influenza specimens, with an overall average positivity rate of 6.26%. The data show a steady increase in the positivity rate for both Influenza A and B from Week 1 through Week 10, reaching a peak positivity of 21.11% in Week 10, with Influenza A accounting for a higher proportion of positive cases than Influenza B throughout the period. Following Week 10, there was a downward trend in the positivity rate, dropping to 6.69% by Week 20, suggesting a potential decline in influenza activity. Despite the overall decrease, the ratio of positive specimens for Influenza B remained consistently high relative to Influenza A in the latter weeks, indicating a persistent circulation of Influenza B. These trends are significant for healthcare planning and resource allocation, as they suggest a seasonal peak has passed but continued monitoring and preparedness for Influenza B cases are necessary.
