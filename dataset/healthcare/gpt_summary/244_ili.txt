Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a clear upward trend in the ratio of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) patients, with recent weeks surpassing the baseline threshold, indicating a growing intensity in ILI activity. The age group 0-4 years has experienced a substantial increase in ILI cases, which may suggest higher vulnerability or transmission rates within this demographic. Adolescents and young adults (age 5-24) have seen the most significant rise in ILI cases, which could have implications for schools and universities. The increase in ILI cases among the working-age population (25-49) and older adults (50-64 and 65 or more) highlights the need for readiness in workplaces and senior care facilities to manage absenteeism and healthcare demands. The observed patterns suggest that healthcare facilities should prepare for continued or increased ILI cases, which may strain healthcare resources and necessitate public health interventions to mitigate the spread of infections.
