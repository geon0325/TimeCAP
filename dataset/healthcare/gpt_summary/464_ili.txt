Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a significant influenza-like illness (ILI) activity, with the percentage of ILI cases among the total number of patients consistently exceeding the 2.9% severity benchmark in all weeks except the last two. The highest ILI activity was recorded between weeks 4 and 5, where the ratio reached 6.31% and 6.90%, respectively, suggesting a peak in influenza cases during this period. Since then, there has been a general downward trend in ILI ratios, culminating in a drop below the severity threshold to 2.58% in the most recent week. Notably, all age groups show a decline in the number of ILI cases over time, with the most substantial decrease observed in the 0-4 and 25-49 age groups, which could indicate the effectiveness of public health interventions or the end of the influenza season. The sustained high levels of ILI cases for the majority of the 20-week period could have placed considerable strain on healthcare resources, and the recent decline suggests a potential easing of this burden.
