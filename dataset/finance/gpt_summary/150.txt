Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with an initial decline followed by a recovery, closing higher at 2937.78, indicative of a potentially cautious yet upward market sentiment. The VIX, or Fear Index, has generally trended downward from a high of 21.09 to 17.33, suggesting that investor anxiety has subsided somewhat, corresponding with the recovery in the S&P 500. During the same period, the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 have experienced fluctuating patterns, with the Nikkei closing slightly higher and the FTSE showing a more distinct upward trend, ending at 7311.30, which could reflect regional economic optimism. Gold Futures have risen from 1507.30 to 1550.30, indicating a flight to safety and investment hedging amidst market uncertainties. The exchange rates have seen the USD strengthening against the EUR and JPY but weakening against the CNY, which may imply shifts in trade dynamics and international currency confidence.
