Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have shown a slight decreasing trend during the night, reaching a minimum in the early hours, before gradually rising again closer to the end of the observed period. Humidity levels have been high and increasing, maintaining saturation for a significant portion of the day, which may suggest the presence of fog or mist, particularly during the latter half of the period. Air pressure has been generally decreasing, indicating a potential change in weather patterns, such as the approach of a weather front which could bring precipitation or a change in temperature. Wind speeds have varied, with some hours experiencing calm conditions and others moderate breezes; the wind direction has been predominantly from the west, shifting more significantly towards the north and east in the latter part of the period. This combination of high humidity, varying wind speeds, and the gradual decrease in air pressure could lead to cooler and potentially damp weather conditions in the near future.
