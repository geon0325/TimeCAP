Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has demonstrated a general upward trend, climbing from 4205.52 to 4378.41, indicating a positive momentum in the U.S. equity market. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, has fluctuated but remained relatively low with a slight upwards move in the latter part of the period, suggesting that investors' fear has not significantly increased despite some daily market swings. The Nikkei 225 showed a remarkable recovery after a dip, with a consistent rise towards the end, reflecting strengthening sentiment in the Japanese stock market. Gold futures have seen a decline from 1958.00 to 1914.00, which may point to investors shifting towards riskier assets as gold often acts as a safe haven. Exchange rates show the U.S. dollar strengthening against the Japanese yen (from 140.44 to 143.46), while it has experienced volatility against the Euro and a notable depreciation against the Chinese yuan (from 7.07 to 7.24), which could indicate shifting economic expectations or changes in trade dynamics.
