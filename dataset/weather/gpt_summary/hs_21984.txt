Over the last 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has shown a slight increasing trend, indicating warmer weather as the day progressed. Humidity levels started high and gradually decreased throughout the period, which may have contributed to a more comfortable feeling later in the day despite the rise in temperature. Air pressure remained relatively stable with only minor fluctuations, indicative of steady weather conditions without significant short-term changes. Wind speeds were consistent, with a slight increase observed later in the period, suggesting that the air movement became slightly more pronounced as time went on. The wind direction shifted from southeasterly to southerly and then veered towards the south-southwest, which could be associated with the transportation of moisture and the observed changes in humidity.
