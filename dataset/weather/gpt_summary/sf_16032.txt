Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have shown a diurnal pattern with a nocturnal low and a daytime high, indicative of typical daily variation. Humidity levels have remained relatively stable, with a slight decrease during the warmest part of the day, which is a common response to increasing temperatures. Air pressure experienced a gradual increase through the majority of the period, suggesting a period of stable weather conditions, but there was a notable drop preceding the report cutoff, which could signal an approaching change in weather patterns. Wind speeds varied, with periods of calm and gusts, including a noteworthy increase towards the latter part of the analysis period, possibly associated with the pressure changes observed. The wind direction was variable but predominantly came from the northerly and westerly directions, with a shift to a northerly direction by the end of the period that could influence incoming weather systems.
