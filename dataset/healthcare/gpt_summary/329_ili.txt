Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a gradual increase in the percentage of patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) across all age groups. The trend shows that while the initial weeks recorded ILI percentages well below the baseline, there has been an upward trajectory, eventually surpassing the baseline in the later weeks. The age group of 5-24 years has seen a notable surge in ILI cases, which could be indicative of higher transmission rates in schools and colleges. Although the oldest age group (65 or more) has the lowest number of ILI cases, the consistent presence of ILI in this demographic is concerning given their increased vulnerability to complications. This upward trend in ILI percentages suggests a potential strain on healthcare resources and highlights the need for enhanced surveillance, vaccination efforts, and public health interventions to mitigate the impact of influenza on the population.
