Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant increase in the number of respiratory specimens tested for influenza, with a peak at week 16 when 81,687 tests were conducted. The percentage of positive specimens surged to a high of 27.37% in week 15, with Influenza A accounting for the majority of cases, peaking at a positivity rate of 22.19% in week 13. Influenza B also showed an upward trend, with its highest positivity rate at 10.95% in week 18, indicating a notable presence alongside Influenza A. However, there has been a recent decline in both the number of specimens tested and the positivity rates, with week 20 showing a decrease to 18.49% overall positivity, suggesting a possible downturn in influenza activity. This observed pattern suggests a taxing influenza season with a peak in the mid-season, followed by a recent decline, which could potentially ease the strain on healthcare resources if the downward trend continues.
