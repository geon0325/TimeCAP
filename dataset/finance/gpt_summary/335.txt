Conversely, the VIX, which measures market volatility, has generally declined from 37.19 to 27.51, indicating a reduction in investor fear and market stress. International markets such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have also experienced upward movements, with the Nikkei 225 showing notable gains, particularly in the latter half of the period, suggesting positive sentiment in Asian markets.
