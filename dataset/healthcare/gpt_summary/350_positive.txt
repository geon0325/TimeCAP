Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable upward trend in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the overall positivity ratio escalating from 1.69% to 12.80%. The increase in positive specimens is predominantly driven by Influenza A, which surged from a ratio of 1.63% to 12.69%, indicating a significant seasonal outbreak that could strain healthcare resources. In contrast, Influenza B has remained a relatively minor contributor to the total positive cases, with its positivity ratio fluctuating narrowly between 0.05% and 0.13%. Despite the overall average positivity ratio being 6.26%, the current value of 12.80% suggests that the infection rate is now well above the average, potentially signaling a peak in the flu season. This trend warrants close surveillance and may necessitate increased healthcare preparedness, including vaccination campaigns, antiviral stockpiling, and resource allocation for the diagnosis and treatment of influenza patients.
