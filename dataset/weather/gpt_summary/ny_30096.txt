Over the last 24 hours, New York City experienced a significant rise in temperature, which suggests a warming trend. Humidity levels showed a marked decrease during this period, possibly due to the increase in temperature, indicating drier air moving into the area. Air pressure has been relatively stable, with a slight decrease that could be associated with the incoming warmer weather. Wind speeds were generally light but increased notably later in the period, which could contribute to the dispersal of humidity and impact local weather conditions. The wind direction was variable but predominantly from the east and shifted towards the west-southwest, which is consistent with the movement of a weather system across the region.
