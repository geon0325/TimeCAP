Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable increase in both the number of respiratory specimens tested for influenza and the percentage of those testing positive. The data indicates a concerning upward trend, with the ratio of positive specimens rising from 0.96% in the first week to 14.26% in the twentieth week, far exceeding the 20-week average of 6.26%. Influenza A has been the predominant strain, with its positivity rate escalating significantly from 0.63% to 13.77%, while Influenza B has shown a smaller increase from 0.32% to 0.50% in the same period. The peak in the ratio of positive specimens aligns with the highest number of tests conducted, suggesting a widespread transmission that could strain healthcare resources due to increased hospitalizations and outpatient visits. The trend underscores the need for public health interventions, including vaccination and antiviral treatment strategies, to mitigate the impact of the ongoing influenza season.
