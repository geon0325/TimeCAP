Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a downward trend, falling from 3327.71 to 2972.37, indicating increased market uncertainty or negative sentiment. This is mirrored by a sharp rise in the VIX, often known as the "fear index," which more than doubled from 15.47 to 41.94, suggesting heightened volatility and investor anxiety. International markets have also experienced declines, with Japan's Nikkei 225 and the UK's FTSE 100 both dropping significantly, signaling a broader global market retreat. Commodity prices have reacted differently: Gold Futures have increased from 1568.60 to 1670.80, indicating a flight to safety by investors, while Crude Oil Futures have plummeted from 50.32 to 41.28, likely due to concerns over reduced demand amidst global economic slowdown. The forex market saw the Euro and Japanese Yen strengthen against the US Dollar, while the Chinese Yuan appreciated slightly, reflecting a potential shift in currency dynamics amid the market volatility.
