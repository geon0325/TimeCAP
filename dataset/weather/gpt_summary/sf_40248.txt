Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a notable fluctuation in temperature, with a general trend of cooling during the early hours followed by a gradual warming towards the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels experienced a significant increase reaching very high levels, indicative of a potentially moist air mass over the area, before decreasing markedly as the temperature rose. Air pressure showed a slight but consistent decrease through much of the period, suggesting a possible change in weather patterns, such as the approach of a weather front. Wind speeds varied with periods of stronger gusts, particularly during times of lower temperatures, while the wind direction was predominantly from the west with shifts to the north and south, which is typical for coastal cities like San Francisco. These indicators suggest variable weather conditions, with changes in wind and pressure pointing to the possibility of an incoming weather system that could affect local conditions in the near future.
