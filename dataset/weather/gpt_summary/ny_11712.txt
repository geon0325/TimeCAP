Over the last 24 hours in New York City, temperatures have shown a gradual increase, transitioning from cooler to milder conditions. Humidity levels were relatively steady in the first few hours but experienced a substantial increase, indicating a possible influx of moisture into the area. Air pressure readings decreased slightly, suggesting a weakening of the high-pressure system that may lead to more dynamic weather patterns. Wind speeds were generally light, with a few periods of calm; however, there was an increase in wind activity later in the day, which could contribute to changes in the current weather conditions. The wind direction was variable, with a notable shift from southerly to westerly winds, potentially bringing in different air masses that could affect the local climate.
