Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable upward trend in the number of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases across all age groups, indicating a growing burden on the healthcare system. Particularly, the most significant increases have been observed in the youngest (ages 0-4) and school-aged (ages 5-24) populations, a trend that may have implications for pediatric healthcare services and educational institutions. Although the overall ratio of ILI patients has remained below the baseline of 2.9%, the consistent upward trajectory suggests that the healthcare system should prepare for the possibility of reaching or exceeding this threshold. The increase in ILI cases also raises concerns about the potential for co-circulation with other respiratory illnesses, which could complicate diagnosis and treatment efforts. Proactive measures, including vaccination and public health education, may become increasingly important to mitigate the spread of ILI and reduce its impact on both public health and healthcare resources.
