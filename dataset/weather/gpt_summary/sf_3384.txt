Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a slight decrease in temperature, indicating a moderately cooling trend. Humidity levels varied considerably, with a notable peak suggesting a period of higher moisture content in the air, which could have implications for fog formation, especially in coastal and bay areas. Air pressure showed a gradual decrease, which is often associated with the approach of a weather system that could result in changing weather patterns such as increased cloudiness or precipitation. Wind speed saw some fluctuations, ending on a higher note, which might influence wave conditions along the coast and contribute to the dispersal of any fog or low-level clouds. The wind direction has been predominantly westerly, with some variability, which is typical for San Francisco's weather and could result in cooler ocean temperatures affecting the local climate.
