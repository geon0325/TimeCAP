Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have experienced slight fluctuations with a general downward trend into cooler conditions before rising slightly again. Humidity levels remained high throughout the period, reaching full saturation at times, which may have contributed to a feeling of mugginess and the potential for fog or dew. Atmospheric pressure showed variability with a significant rise followed by a gradual decrease, indicating changing weather patterns that could lead to instability in the local weather conditions. Wind speeds varied, with periods of stronger gusts giving way to calmer conditions, and the wind direction shifted significantly at certain points, suggesting the passage of a weather front through the area. Overall, these indicators point to an active weather system affecting Houston, with the possibility of changing conditions that could include cooler temperatures, increased humidity-related phenomena, and varying wind conditions.
