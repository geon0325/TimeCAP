Over the last 24 hours in New York City, the temperature exhibited a slight increase, followed by a moderate decrease, and then a gradual rise towards the end of the period, suggesting variable but mostly stable conditions. Humidity levels were very high in the early hours, reaching saturation, before a significant drop occurred, which can often lead to a feeling of increased comfort and potentially reduce the chance of rain. Air pressure decreased steadily into the lower range of the typical atmospheric pressure, indicating a possible approach of a weather system that could cause unsettled weather conditions. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate throughout the period, with a couple of brief increases, which is generally not indicative of severe weather. Lastly, wind direction varied but primarily blew from a southerly direction, shifting more westerly later on, which could influence temperature and humidity as it potentially brings in different air masses.
