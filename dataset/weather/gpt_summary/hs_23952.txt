Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual decline in temperature from its peak during the day, followed by a subtle increase towards the latter part of the series, consistent with the typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels were high, peaking at full saturation during the night and early morning hours, which could have led to foggy conditions and potentially caused visibility issues. The air pressure remained relatively steady, with only minor fluctuations, indicating stable weather conditions without significant frontal activity. Wind speeds varied modestly, mostly light to gentle breezes, with a notable decrease in wind activity during the night, which is common due to the reduction in surface heating and the weakening of pressure gradients. The wind direction was predominantly from the south to south-west, with occasional shifts, suggesting the influence of local sea breezes or passing weather systems.
