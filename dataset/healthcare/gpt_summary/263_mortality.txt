Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable decrease in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia, starting at a high of 17.01% and reducing to 6.28% by the end of the period. This decline outpaces the reduction in total deaths, which decreased from 85,537 to 57,525. The absolute number of deaths from both Influenza and Pneumonia has also fallen significantly, with pneumonia deaths dropping from 14,398 to 3,530, and influenza deaths from 149 to 83. Despite the overall decrease, the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia to total deaths remained above the 20-week average of 7.84% for the first 11 weeks, suggesting a heightened impact of these illnesses during that period. The downward trend in mortality due to these conditions suggests an improvement in public health measures or seasonal variations but warrants continued monitoring to manage healthcare resources effectively.
