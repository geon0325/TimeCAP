The VIX, which measures market volatility, has gradually declined from 16.42 to 15.07, suggesting that investors are experiencing less anxiety and uncertainty in the market. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have displayed a degree of volatility, with the Nikkei experiencing a significant drop mid-period before partially recovering, and the FTSE 100 showing moderate fluctuations but closing relatively flat.

Commodity prices have experienced mixed movements; Gold Futures saw a sharp drop around the mid-point of the period but have since recovered towards the end, while Crude Oil Futures have risen, indicating potential inflationary pressures or growing economic activity. Exchange rates have shown the USD strengthening against the EUR and JPY but remaining relatively stable versus the CNY, which could impact international trade dynamics and merit attention for potential currency effects on multinational companies.
