Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant upward trend in the proportion of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases across all age groups, with the ratio of ILI patients increasing from 1.83% to a peak of 6.90% before slightly decreasing to 5.76% in the most recent week. This trend surpasses the 2.9% threshold for severity assessment beginning from week 11 and continues to do so, indicating a substantial and sustained influenza activity. The age groups that have seen the most notable increases are those aged 5-24 and 25-49, with the former peaking at a remarkable increase in ILI cases from week 15 onwards, suggesting a high transmission rate among school-aged children and young adults. The substantial rise in ILI cases among the elderly (age 65 or more) and the subsequent high demand for healthcare resources could be particularly concerning due to the increased risk of complications in this age group. This sustained increase in ILI incidence highlights the need for heightened public health interventions, increased vaccination efforts, and preparedness in the healthcare system to manage the growing number of patients effectively.
