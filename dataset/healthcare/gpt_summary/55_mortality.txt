Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable decrease in both the total number of deaths and the number of deaths from influenza and pneumonia. The proportion of deaths attributed to influenza or pneumonia compared to total deaths started at 10.57% but showed a declining trend, ending at 5.62%, which is below the 20-week average of 7.84%. This decline suggests an improvement in the control or treatment of these respiratory conditions or could be indicative of seasonal variations in disease prevalence. The significant drop in influenza-associated deaths, from 1448 to 14, could also reflect the impact of public health interventions, such as vaccination campaigns. However, while pneumonia-related deaths also decreased, they did so at a slower rate, maintaining a more consistent presence among the causes of death, which requires ongoing attention from healthcare providers and policymakers.
