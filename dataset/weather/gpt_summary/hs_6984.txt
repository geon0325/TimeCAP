Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature, exhibiting a diurnal pattern with the warmest conditions in the late afternoon transitioning to cooler temperatures overnight and warming again toward the following afternoon. Relative humidity levels have increased significantly overnight, which is typical when temperatures drop, indicating a higher likelihood of morning condensation or fog development. Air pressure has remained relatively stable with only a slight decrease recently, suggesting stable weather conditions without the immediate approach of a significant weather system. Wind speeds have been generally light, with occasional increases that could contribute to minor wind chill effects during cooler periods. Wind direction has varied, with notable shifts from easterly to southerly, then westerly, and finally northerly, which could have influenced local temperature and humidity levels due to the advection of air masses with different characteristics.
