Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a significant uptick in the incidence of Influenza-like Illness (ILI), with the ratio of ILI patients rising from 1.62% to a peak of 7.37%, far exceeding the 2.9% benchmark indicating a severe influenza situation. This increase is observed across all age groups, with the most notable surges in the 5-24 and 25-49 age brackets, which could suggest higher transmission rates among school-aged children and working-age adults. The trend indicates that ILI cases have consistently surpassed the severity threshold since week 10, with a slight decrease noted in the most recent weeks, though still above the critical level. The sustained high proportion of ILI cases may indicate a longer and more intense influenza season, which could strain healthcare resources, necessitate increased healthcare services, and potentially impact workforce productivity. Healthcare providers and public health officials should consider bolstering influenza prevention strategies, vaccination efforts, and prepare for continued elevated demand for medical care for the foreseeable future.
