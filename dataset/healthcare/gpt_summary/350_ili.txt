The analysis of the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data over the last 20 weeks reveals a fluctuating yet notable upward trend in the ratio of ILI patients, with a peak that significantly surpassed the baseline threshold for determining an influenza situation. This peak is particularly pronounced in the age groups 25-49 and 5-24, indicating that these demographics were the most affected during the highest incidence period. Following the peak, there has been a decline in the ILI ratio across all age groups, suggesting a waning phase of the influenza outbreak. However, the highest age group, 65 or more, consistently showed the lowest number of ILI patients, which may reflect either lower incidence or underreporting in this demographic. The healthcare system likely experienced increased demand during the peak period, necessitating resource allocation to manage the influx of ILI cases, and should remain vigilant for potential future surges.
