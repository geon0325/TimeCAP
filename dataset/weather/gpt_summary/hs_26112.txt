Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature, initially decreasing to a minimum during the early hours before rising significantly towards the afternoon and evening, indicating typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels were high throughout the night and early morning, which is common in this area, but they dropped sharply as temperatures peaked, suggesting a possible increase in thermal discomfort during the hottest part of the day. Air pressure showed a general increasing trend with a slight dip towards the evening, hinting at a brief and likely minor change in weather patterns. Wind speeds remained relatively low and constant, suggesting a calm weather period without significant wind-related events. However, the wind direction varied considerably, which could have contributed to changes in temperature and humidity levels, as differing wind directions can transport air masses with varying characteristics.
