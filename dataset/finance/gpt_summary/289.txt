Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown significant volatility with a downward trend, starting at 3116.39 and reaching a low of 2237.40 before a slight recovery to 2447.33, indicating investor uncertainty and potential bear market conditions. The VIX, or Volatility Index, has surged, starting at 27.56 and spiking to a high of 82.69, underscoring the heightened market volatility and risk aversion among investors. Global equity markets mirrored this trend, with Japan's Nikkei 225 and the UK's FTSE 100 both experiencing sharp declines, although the Nikkei showed a notable rebound in the most recent days. Commodity prices also reflected the market's instability; Gold Futures initially held steady but then spiked, suggesting a flight to safety, while Crude Oil Futures plummeted from 48.73 to a low of 20.37, reflecting both the price war and diminished demand due to the global situation. Exchange rates saw the Euro and the Japanese Yen strengthening against the US Dollar, indicating a possible shift towards perceived safer currencies, while the US Dollar remained relatively stable against the Chinese Yuan.
