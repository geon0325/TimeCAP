Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant upward trend in the ratio of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the overall positivity rate growing from 1.68% to 15.37%. Influenza A has been the predominant strain, with its positivity rate increasing more markedly from 1.10% to 14.02%, while Influenza B also showed an increase but at a slower rate, from 0.58% to 1.35%. The most substantial week-over-week increases were observed in the latter weeks, with a notable surge between weeks 15 and 16, where the positivity rate for Influenza A almost doubled from 5.79% to 9.52%. The highest recorded weekly positivity rates for both Influenza A and B occurred in the final week, indicating a peak in influenza activity. This trend suggests a rising burden on healthcare resources, necessitating increased vigilance, resource allocation for patient care, and possibly influencing vaccination and prevention strategies.
