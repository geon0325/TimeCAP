The analysis of the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data over the last 20 weeks indicates a downward trend in the ratio of ILI patients, which has consistently remained below the baseline threshold of 2.9% in recent weeks. Initially, there was a significant surge above the baseline, suggesting a widespread prevalence of ILI symptoms which could have placed additional strain on healthcare resources. The age group of 5-24 years old showed the highest number of ILI cases, which could be attributed to high levels of social interaction and potential school-based transmission. The decrease in overall ILI cases across all age groups suggests a reduction in the spread of viral illnesses or effective public health interventions. Nevertheless, healthcare systems should remain vigilant for any signs of resurgence, especially in the younger and older populations who are often more vulnerable to complications from ILI.
