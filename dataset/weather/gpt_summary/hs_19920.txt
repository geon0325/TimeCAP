Over the past day, Houston has experienced a relatively stable temperature profile with a gradual increase toward the latter part of the series, indicating a slight warming trend. Humidity levels remained high throughout the period, which could contribute to a muggy or damp feeling in the air, potentially leading to discomfort for individuals sensitive to such conditions. Air pressure showed a slow decreasing trend, which might suggest an approaching weather system that could alter the current stable conditions. Wind speeds were consistent and moderate, with no significant gusts or lulls, suggesting steady atmospheric conditions. The wind direction was predominantly from the northeast, shifting slightly eastward over time, which is typical for this region and may influence coastal weather patterns.
