Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a notable increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before gradually declining towards the evening. Humidity levels have shown significant fluctuation, with a general trend of increasing overnight and early morning hours, suggesting a muggy start to the day that gave way to drier conditions in the afternoon. Air pressure remained relatively steady with minor variations, indicating a stable atmospheric condition that is unlikely to drive significant weather changes in the short term. Wind speeds were mostly light throughout the day with occasional gentle breezes, and the wind direction shifted from predominantly southeast to east and then to a more northeasterly direction in the early hours, before returning to a southeasterly direction by the end of the period. These conditions suggest that the weather in Houston has been generally stable, but the high humidity levels in the morning could have led to some discomfort for residents.
