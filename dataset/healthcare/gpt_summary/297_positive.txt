Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the testing and detection of influenza with an average positive specimen ratio of 6.26%. The number of specimens tested for influenza has increased steadily, reaching a peak in the last week, while the number of positive cases for both influenza A and B has also escalated, particularly in the last week where a significant spike in influenza A cases is observed. The ratios of positive specimens for both strains of influenza remained relatively stable in the initial weeks but have shown an upward trend in recent weeks, with influenza A positivity increasing markedly to 0.19% from a low of 0.01%. This trend suggests a possible surge in influenza activity, with the latest ratio of positive specimens more than threefold the average, which could signal the onset of a more widespread outbreak. Given these trends, healthcare providers might need to prepare for an increased burden on healthcare resources, including diagnostic testing, treatment for flu-related complications, and potentially heightened public health measures.
