Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable decline in both the number and ratio of deaths attributed to Influenza or Pneumonia in relation to the total number of deaths. The ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia has decreased from 6.58% in the first week to 5.00% in the twentieth week, consistently staying below the average ratio of 7.84%. Total deaths have also shown a slight downward trend, starting at 60,696 and ending at 55,665. Deaths from pneumonia have decreased from 3,938 to 2,768, while influenza-related deaths have similarly fallen from 54 to 16. This overall downward trend could suggest an improvement in the control and treatment of these respiratory conditions or a seasonal decline, potentially easing the burden on healthcare resources dedicated to these diseases.
