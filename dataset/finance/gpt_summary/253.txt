Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown signs of volatility with an overall downtrend, reducing from a high of 3274.70 to a low of 3225.52, which may indicate growing investor caution. The VIX, or Volatility Index, reflects this uncertainty, with a marked increase from lows around 12.54 to a peak of 18.84, suggesting a higher level of market stress. International markets like the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have also experienced fluctuations, with the Nikkei showing a slight downward trend and the FTSE 100 notably declining from 7622.40 to 7286.00, possibly influenced by domestic and global economic concerns. Commodity prices have been mixed; Gold Futures have generally increased, hinting at a flight to safety, while Crude Oil Futures have trended downwards, potentially due to concerns over global demand. Currency markets have seen the EUR/USD and USD/JYP pairs hold relatively steady with slight depreciation of the USD, while the USD/CNY exchange rate remained remarkably stable, indicating that currency markets have not reacted strongly to the other observed market trends during this period.
