Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a consistent upward trend, increasing from 2893.06 to 3078.27, which suggests a positive sentiment among investors. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, has generally declined from 20.28 to 12.83, indicating that investors are facing lower uncertainty and risk. International markets such as the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 have also experienced gains, with the Nikkei showing some fluctuations but ending flat, and the FTSE increasing notably, which could reflect broader global market confidence. Gold Futures have seen modest fluctuations but ended the period nearly unchanged, suggesting that while there is some appeal for safe-haven assets, the urgency for them has not increased. Crude Oil Futures have increased slightly, hinting at a cautiously optimistic outlook on global economic growth, while the exchange rates for EUR/USD and USD/CNY have remained relatively stable, with a slight depreciation of the USD against these currencies, which could have implications for international trade dynamics.
