Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, indicating a warming trend. Humidity levels have remained consistently high, at or near saturation, which could contribute to the feeling of mugginess and the potential for fog or mist. Air pressure has shown a slight declining trend, which is often associated with the approach of a low-pressure system that could lead to changing weather conditions, possibly including increased cloudiness or precipitation. Wind speeds have been generally light and variable, with a significant shift in wind direction occurring in the latter part of the period, suggesting a change in the local weather pattern. The combination of these factors points to a dynamic weather situation that may lead to more pronounced changes in the near future.
