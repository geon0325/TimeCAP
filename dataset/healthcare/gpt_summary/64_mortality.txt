Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable decline in the mortality ratio of deaths attributable to influenza or pneumonia when compared to total deaths, starting from 7.40% and decreasing to 5.26%. This decline in the mortality ratio indicates a reduction in the impact of these respiratory conditions relative to other causes of death. Despite fluctuations, the number of deaths from pneumonia has also shown a downward trend, with initial figures at 3779 decreasing to 2673 by the end of the 20-week period. Deaths from influenza have significantly dropped from 284 to 10, showing a marked decrease in influenza-associated mortality. These trends suggest an improvement in the management or prevalence of influenza and pneumonia, which could alleviate some of the burdens on healthcare resources dedicated to these diseases.
