Over the last 20 weeks, the average ratio of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza has been below the reported average of 6.26%, with a peak positivity rate of 0.15% in weeks 12 and 13, which coincides with a decrease in the number of specimens tested during those weeks. Influenza B has consistently shown higher positivity rates compared to Influenza A, with the highest recorded at 0.09% for Influenza B, versus 0.08% for Influenza A. Both strains of influenza exhibited a slight increase in positivity rates in the latter weeks, suggesting a potential uptick in influenza activity. Despite this, the overall low positivity rates indicate that influenza is not widely prevalent during the observed period. The healthcare system should continue monitoring these trends closely, as even small increases could signify the beginning of an upward trend in influenza infections, which could have implications for public health measures and resource allocation.
