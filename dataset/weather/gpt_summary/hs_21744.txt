Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable trend of rising temperatures following a cooler period, indicative of a warming pattern. Humidity levels have fluctuated moderately but remained relatively high, suggesting a muggy atmosphere throughout the city. Air pressure has been quite stable with a slight decrease noted recently, which could hint at a potential change in weather patterns, possibly leading to developing weather systems. Wind speeds have been mostly gentle to moderate with some variability, and the prevailing winds have shifted direction from northerly to more westerly, which may influence local weather conditions such as temperature and precipitation. Overall, the combination of increasing temperatures, high humidity, stable pressure, and changing wind direction could suggest a fair but possibly unsettled weather outlook for Houston in the near term.
