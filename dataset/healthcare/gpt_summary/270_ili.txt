The time-series data for influenza-like illness (ILI) over the last 20 weeks shows a significant early peak in the ratio of ILI patients, which was well above the baseline, indicating a heightened period of ILI activity. Subsequently, there was a notable decline in ILI percentages, eventually dropping below the baseline, which suggests a decrease in ILI incidence across all age groups. The most substantial early burden of ILI was observed in the youngest (0-4 years) and the oldest (65 years or more) age groups, which are traditionally the most vulnerable populations. However, as the weeks progressed, the ILI rates in these age groups decreased, aligning with the overall downward trend in ILI activity. This decline in ILI rates is likely to reduce the strain on healthcare resources, but continued monitoring is essential to respond effectively to potential fluctuations in ILI incidence.
