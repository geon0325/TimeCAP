Over the past 24 hours in New York City, there has been a notable fluctuation in temperature, starting off relatively high then tapering off before rising once again. Humidity levels have seen significant variation, with particularly high levels during the cooler early morning hours, indicating the potential for morning fog or dew. Air pressure has remained fairly steady, suggesting stable weather conditions without the presence of strong frontal systems. Wind speeds varied, being calm at times and breezy at others, with an interesting shift in wind direction from westerly to northerly and then to southerly, which may have influenced temperature changes throughout the day. Such wind direction shifts could have also contributed to variations in humidity levels, by bringing different air masses into the region.
