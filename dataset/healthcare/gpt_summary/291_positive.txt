Over the last 20 weeks, the testing for influenza shows a consistent presence of both Influenza A and B strains, albeit at low levels, with an overall average positivity rate of 6.26%. The number of specimens tested peaked in week 20 at 43,510, a significant increase from the initial count of 30,176 in week 1. Despite fluctuations, the ratio of positive specimens for Influenza A has remained relatively stable with a slight peak around week 3 (0.08%), but it has not exceeded this value since then. Influenza B showed a similar pattern of stability, with a slightly higher ratio early on, peaking at week 4 (0.09%), and generally trending alongside Influenza A in terms of positivity rates thereafter. The low and stable ratio of positive specimens suggests controlled influenza activity, but continued surveillance is necessary to monitor for potential outbreaks or increases in infection rates which could strain healthcare resources.
