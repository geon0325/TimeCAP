Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a notable fluctuation in temperature, exhibiting a significant rise during daylight hours followed by a modest decrease as the evening approached, suggesting typical diurnal variation influenced by solar heating and nighttime cooling. Humidity levels experienced a general decrease throughout the day, indicative of drier air moving into the area, which could lead to increased comfort and a lower heat index. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight tendency to increase, which is often associated with steady weather patterns and possibly the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were mostly light and variable, which are not likely to cause significant wind-related impacts. The wind direction showed a gradual shift from southerly to more westerly and then veering towards the southeast, which might be indicative of a changing weather system moving through the region.
