Over the past 20 weeks, the data reveals a notable upward trend in the ratio of ILI patients, with the most recent figures surpassing the baseline threshold that indicates an elevated influenza activity. This increase is consistent across all age groups, with the most significant uptick observed in the youngest (0-4 years) and school-aged children (5-24 years), suggesting a higher transmission rate among these demographics. The progressive rise in ILI case ratios suggests a potential strain on healthcare resources, particularly in pediatrics and family medicine. Given that the ratio of ILI patients has now risen above the baseline, public health interventions may be necessary to mitigate the spread of influenza-like illnesses. Healthcare providers should be prepared for a continued influx of ILI cases, and vaccination strategies along with other preventive measures should be emphasized to control the outbreak.
