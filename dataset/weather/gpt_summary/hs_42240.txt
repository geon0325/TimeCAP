Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have experienced a gradual rise, indicative of a warming trend that reached its peak in the late afternoon before a slight dip in the evening. Humidity levels showed a marked decrease during the day, suggesting drier air moving into the area, possibly leading to increased discomfort or heat stress for individuals outdoors. Air pressure has been relatively stable, but there is a slight downward trend, which could signal a minor change in weather patterns, such as the potential for developing weather fronts or systems. Wind speeds have remained generally light to moderate throughout the period, with no significant gusts, indicating stable weather conditions. The wind direction has varied but maintained a general southerly component, which is typical for Houston and may contribute to the transport of warmer air from the Gulf of Mexico into the region.
