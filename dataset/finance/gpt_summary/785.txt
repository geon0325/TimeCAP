Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a downward trend, declining from 4418.64 to 4204.31, indicating a potential increase in investor caution or response to negative market stimuli. The VIX, commonly referred to as the "fear index," has fluctuated but ended the period slightly higher, moving from 27.36 to 30.75, which aligns with the increased volatility and uncertainty within the stock market. International equity indices such as the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 have also experienced declines, suggesting a global trend of risk aversion among investors. Commodity prices like Gold and Crude Oil Futures have risen, with Gold moving from 1840.80 to 1982.70 and Crude Oil jumping significantly from 93.10 to 109.33, likely reflecting a hedge against inflation and geopolitical tensions impacting oil supply, respectively. Currency exchange rates have seen the EUR/USD and USD/JPY pairs experiencing mild fluctuations, while the USD/CNY pair has remained remarkably stable, indicating current exchange rate policies and market reactions to broader economic conditions.
