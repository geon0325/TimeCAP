Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature experienced a general increasing trend, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before slightly dipping in the evening. Humidity levels showed a significant drop during daytime hours, likely due to increased temperatures, and peaked at full saturation in the early morning, indicating the possibility of fog or dew. Air pressure remained relatively stable but experienced a notable increase during midday, which could suggest the transient influence of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds varied, remaining low for much of the period but increasing towards the evening, which might have contributed to the dispersal of humidity and a clearer sky. Wind direction was predominantly from the south-southeast, shifting briefly to a northwesterly direction in the morning, before returning to southeasterly winds, consistent with the passage of a weather front through the area.
