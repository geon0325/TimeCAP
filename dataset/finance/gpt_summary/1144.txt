Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a downward trend, decreasing from 4534.87 to 4404.33, signaling potential investor concern and a possible shift toward a bearish market sentiment. Volatility, as indicated by the VIX, has increased slightly from 13.99 to 16.78, reflecting rising uncertainty among investors. Both the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have also experienced declines, with the Nikkei dropping from 32490.52 to 31766.82, and the FTSE falling from 7646.10 to 7356.90, suggesting a broader global market retreat.

Commodity prices have shown mixed signals; Gold Futures have decreased modestly, indicating a reduced appeal for traditional safe-haven assets, whereas Crude Oil Futures have seen some volatility but ended on a lower note from 75.63 to 79.38, potentially due to fluctuating demand expectations. Currency exchange rates have seen the EUR/USD and USD/CNY pairs weaken against the dollar, moving from 1.12 to 1.09 and 7.23 to 7.28 respectively, while the USD/JPY has strengthened from 139.60 to 145.61, suggesting a stronger dollar amidst global market uncertainty.
