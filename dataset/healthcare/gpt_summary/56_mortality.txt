Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable decline in the percentage of deaths attributed to influenza or pneumonia relative to total mortality, with a decrease from 10.23% to 5.74%. This decrease indicates a positive trend in the control or reduction of these respiratory diseases as causes of death. Despite fluctuations in total mortality numbers, the absolute number of deaths from influenza has significantly decreased from 1,360 to 14, suggesting a substantial reduction in influenza-related mortality. Pneumonia-related deaths have also decreased but less dramatically, from 4,877 to 2,935, which may point to continued challenges in managing pneumonia outcomes. This trend could alleviate some of the pressure on healthcare systems, but continued vigilance and preventive measures are necessary to sustain this progress, especially considering the potential for seasonal variations.
