Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching a peak in the late afternoon before slightly decreasing towards the evening. The humidity levels have shown significant fluctuations, with the highest readings occurring during the early morning hours when the temperature was lower, indicative of a muggy atmosphere. Air pressure has been gradually rising throughout the day, which typically suggests stable weather conditions are prevailing or approaching. Wind speeds have been relatively light but saw a noticeable uptick in the afternoon, coinciding with the highest temperature reading of the day, which could have contributed to a temporary relief from the heat.
