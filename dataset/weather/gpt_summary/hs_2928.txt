Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a gradual increase in temperature during the day, peaking in the afternoon before stabilizing in the evening. Humidity levels have shown a significant decrease as temperatures rose, suggesting drier air moving into the area. Air pressure experienced a noticeable drop in the later hours, which could indicate the approach of a weather system that might lead to changing weather conditions. Wind speeds have generally been mild, although there was an increase towards the end of the period, which, along with the varying wind directions, could signal a shift in weather patterns or the presence of a frontal system. The combination of lowering humidity, decreasing pressure, and increasing wind speeds may suggest the likelihood of upcoming meteorological changes in Houston.
