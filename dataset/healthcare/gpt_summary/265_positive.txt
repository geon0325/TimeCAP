Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a fluctuating but generally low prevalence of influenza, with the average positive rate for specimens at 6.26%, and weekly positive rates ranging from 0.09% to 0.29%. Influenza B has consistently shown a higher incidence compared to Influenza A, with its peak ratio of positive specimens at 0.21% in week 10, while Influenza A peaked at 0.11% in the first week. There is a notable decline in the positivity rate for both Influenza A and B towards the end of the 20-week period, with Influenza A dropping to 0.07% and Influenza B to 0.05% in the last week. The highest number of specimens tested occurred in week 5 (42,526), yet this did not correspond with the peak in positive specimens, indicating variability in transmission that is not directly proportionate to testing volume. Given the overall low positivity rates, the impact on the healthcare system is likely manageable at this time, but continued surveillance is crucial to detect and respond to any potential spikes or shifts in the pattern of infection.
