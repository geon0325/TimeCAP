Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced highly stable meteorological conditions. The temperature has remained constant, which is unusual for any location, suggesting a potential error in data reporting or recording. Humidity levels have also been steady at a relatively low value, indicating dry air prevailing in the area. Atmospheric pressure has shown no variation, maintaining a stable value that suggests no immediate change in weather patterns such as the onset of a storm system. The wind has been consistent in both speed and direction, originating from the southeast, which could contribute to the transport of air masses from that direction, potentially affecting coastal conditions and temperature over time.
