Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, which is typical as it transitions from day to night, followed by a moderate increase during the daytime. Relative humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with markedly lower values in the middle of the day, suggesting drier conditions that could have an impact on comfort levels and possibly increase the risk of wildfires. Air pressure saw an overall increase, reaching its peak in the afternoon, which typically indicates stable weather conditions and a lower chance of precipitation. Wind speeds varied, with some stronger gusts observed, which could contribute to cooler perceived temperatures and might affect maritime activities in the bay. The predominant wind direction was westerly, which is common for San Francisco, bringing in the cool marine air from the Pacific Ocean that characterizes the city's climate.
