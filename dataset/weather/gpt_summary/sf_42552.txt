Over the past day, San Francisco has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, peaking in the later hours, indicating a typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels have shown significant fluctuations, with a notably high percentage during the early hours likely due to overnight cooling and possible fog development, which subsequently decreased towards the afternoon as temperatures rose. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight decreasing trend toward the end of the period, which could suggest an approaching weather system. Wind speeds varied, with calmer conditions prevailing in the latter half of the day, and wind directions shifted throughout the day, including a notable change from northerly to easterly winds, which could influence the local climate by bringing different air masses into the region. Overall, these indicators suggest a dynamic weather pattern with potential implications for changing weather conditions in the near term.
