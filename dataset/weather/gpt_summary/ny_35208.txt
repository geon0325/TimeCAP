Over the past 24 hours in New York City, the temperature experienced a gradual increase from early cooler conditions to warmer temperatures by afternoon, before slightly decreasing again. The relative humidity was very high, often reaching saturation, which suggests the possibility of fog or mist, particularly during the cooler early hours, and could have led to a damp feel in the air. Air pressure showed a slow decreasing trend, indicative of a change in the weather pattern, possibly a transition towards less stable conditions. Wind speeds remained light and fairly consistent throughout the period, with no significant gusts that could impact outdoor activities. The wind direction varied but was predominantly from the east to southeast, which can bring moisture from the Atlantic Ocean into the city, potentially contributing to the high humidity levels experienced.
