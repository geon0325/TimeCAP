The data indicates a peak in the ratio of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) patients during the mid-section of the 20-week period analyzed, surpassing the baseline level that defines an elevated influenza situation. This peak is followed by a consistent decline in ILI percentages across all age groups in the subsequent weeks, ultimately falling below the baseline. Such a trend suggests that the healthcare system faced higher demand during the peak weeks, especially from the age groups 5-24 and 25-49, which may have impacted resources, including staffing and bed availability. With the recent downtrend in ILI percentages, the pressure on the healthcare system seems to be easing. However, continued surveillance is necessary to monitor for potential resurgences or new outbreaks, and to ensure that the healthcare system remains prepared for fluctuations in ILI cases.
