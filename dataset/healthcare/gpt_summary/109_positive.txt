Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the proportion of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a peak ratio of 27.37% observed in week 11, followed by a downward trend settling at 15.33% in week 20. Influenza A has consistently been more prevalent than Influenza B throughout the period, peaking at 21.62% in week 8 and decreasing to 6.05% by week 20. In contrast, the proportion of Influenza B rose steadily to a high of 9.65% in week 14, despite a slight decrease to 9.28% by week 20, its impact remained significant. The overall decline in positive test ratios for both Influenza A and B in recent weeks suggests a possible downtrend in influenza activity; however, the healthcare system must remain vigilant due to the sustained presence of Influenza B and the potential for new spikes. These trends are critical for healthcare planning and resource allocation, especially in preparing for potential surges and managing the seasonal burden on healthcare facilities.
