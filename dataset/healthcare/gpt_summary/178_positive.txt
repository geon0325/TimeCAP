Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a general downward trend in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a peak positivity rate of 26.13% in week two declining to 2.22% by week 20. Influenza A has consistently been the predominant subtype, with its highest positivity of 25.07% in week two, reducing to 1.26% by the end of the period. The positivity rate for Influenza B has been significantly lower than for Influenza A, peaking at 1.79% in week six and decreasing to 0.96% in week 20. Despite the overall decrease in positivity rates, the ratios of positive specimens (6.26% average) suggest that influenza remains a significant concern for the healthcare system. The declining trend could signal a waning influenza season but also warrants continuous monitoring to manage potential healthcare demands and inform vaccination and prevention strategies.
