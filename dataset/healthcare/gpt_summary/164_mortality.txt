Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia to the total number of deaths has fluctuated, with a marked peak of 15.78% in week 7, significantly higher than the average ratio of 7.84%. The total number of deaths peaked in week 7 at 78,946, coinciding with the highest recorded weekly mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia. Following this peak, there has been a general downward trend in deaths attributed to Influenza or Pneumonia, with the lowest numbers seen in week 19 for influenza-related deaths (4 deaths) and a substantial decrease in pneumonia deaths from week 7 to week 20 (11,988 to 5,535 deaths). However, the final week shows an uptick in the mortality ratio (8.97%) and pneumonia-related deaths, suggesting a potential resurgence that the healthcare system should monitor closely. The fluctuations and the observed peak in Influenza or Pneumonia deaths could indicate seasonal trends or an outbreak that requires continued public health attention and resources to manage.
