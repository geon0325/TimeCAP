Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before slowly declining towards the evening. Humidity levels showed significant variability, with a noticeable drop in the afternoon indicating drier conditions which persisted into the night. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with only minor fluctuations that suggest steady weather patterns without any significant disturbances. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, increasing during the day before tapering off in the evening, with prevailing winds shifting from easterly in the early hours to predominantly westerly and then settling on a southwesterly direction. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and stable pressure likely contributed to pleasant weather conditions, although the increase in wind speeds during the afternoon may have made it feel cooler despite the warmth.
