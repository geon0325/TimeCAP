Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced relatively stable and cold temperatures with slight fluctuations, remaining close to the freezing point. Humidity levels varied considerably, reaching near saturation overnight which could have led to foggy conditions, but also showed significant drops suggesting periods of drier air. Atmospheric pressure has been on a gradual increase throughout the day, indicating a trend towards more stable weather conditions. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate with some variability, and wind direction shifted throughout the day, with a general trend from southerly to northerly directions, which could have influenced the temperature and humidity changes observed. The combination of increasing pressure, variable winds, and fluctuating humidity suggests that New York City weather has been dynamic, but may be trending towards clearer and more stable conditions.
