Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a mild decline in temperature during the night followed by a gradual increase throughout the day, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels have fluctuated significantly, with periods of complete saturation suggesting the possibility of fog formation, especially during times when temperature and humidity were both high. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable, with only slight variations, indicating steady weather conditions without the immediate likelihood of significant weather disturbances. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with some variability in direction, which could have contributed to the dispersal of any fog or low-lying clouds, particularly when wind speeds were higher. The wind's shift from southerly to westerly and northerly directions throughout the period may have influenced coastal conditions, potentially affecting maritime activities.
