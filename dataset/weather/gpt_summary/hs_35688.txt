Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced a noticeable fluctuation in temperature, with a warming trend observed during the day followed by a cooling trend in the evening and early morning hours. Humidity levels were inversely correlated with temperature changes, showing higher humidity during cooler periods and substantially lower humidity when temperatures peaked. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with only slight variations, indicating a period of stable weather conditions without the presence of significant frontal systems. Wind speeds were generally light and variable, with no significant gusts that would indicate stormy conditions. The wind direction shifted throughout the day, primarily coming from the east and southeast, which is typical for Houston's climate and may contribute to the transport of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico into the area.
