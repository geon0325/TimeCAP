Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual decline in temperature, which later reversed, culminating in a significant rise towards the later hours. Humidity levels showed a marked fluctuation, with a peak during the early hours which is common due to nighttime cooling, followed by a substantial drop during the hottest part of the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor variations, indicating no significant weather fronts passing through the area. Wind speeds were generally light but increased notably in the latter part of the period, suggesting a possible change in weather conditions. The wind direction was variable, with a notable shift from predominantly southerly to a more northwesterly direction, which could signal the arrival of a cooler air mass moving into the region.
