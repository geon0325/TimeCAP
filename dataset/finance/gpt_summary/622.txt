Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a general upward trend, closing higher at 4323.06 from an initial 4246.44, despite minor fluctuations and a notable dip towards the end of the period. The VIX, commonly known as the "fear index," has experienced increased volatility, ending at a heightened level of 19.73 from a starting point of 16.66, indicating growing market uncertainty. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 indices both reflected bearish trends, with the Nikkei declining significantly from 28884.13 to 27388.16 and the FTSE 100 dropping to 6881.10 from an initial 7090.00, which could signal concerns about international market stability. Gold Futures remained relatively stable with a slight increase, suggesting investors may be seeking safe-haven assets amidst market uncertainty, ending at 1810.90 from a starting point of 1776.30. Meanwhile, Crude Oil Futures faced a sharp decline to 67.42 from 73.06, which could indicate a shift in energy market sentiment or response to broader economic factors, while currency exchange rates remained largely stable with minor depreciations in the EUR/USD and USD/JPY pairs, and a slight appreciation of the USD against the CNY.
