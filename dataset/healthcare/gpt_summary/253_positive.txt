Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a fluctuating but overall increasing trend in the number of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the total number of specimens tested peaking in week 17 at 42,526. The ratio of positive specimens for both Influenza A and B has remained relatively low, with Influenza B consistently showing a higher positivity ratio than Influenza A, culminating in a peak of 0.20% and 0.18% respectively in weeks 19 and 20. Despite the low percentages, the absolute number of positive cases for Influenza B has increased more significantly than for Influenza A, reaching a high of 81 and 67 positive specimens respectively in the last two weeks. The overall positivity ratio for influenza peaked at 0.40% in week 6, and has since varied, ending the 20-week period at 0.28%, which is still below the average ratio of 6.26% for positive specimens. This data suggests a relatively stable influenza activity with occasional spikes, but the healthcare system should remain vigilant for any signs of increasing trends that could indicate a surge in influenza cases.
