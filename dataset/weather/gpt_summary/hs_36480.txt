Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, suggesting a cooling trend. Humidity levels showed significant variation, with a notable dip during the midday hours, indicating that there may have been periods of drier conditions followed by a sharp increase towards the evening. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, which typically suggests stable weather conditions are prevailing or approaching. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a peak in the afternoon, which could have contributed to the temporary decrease in humidity by dispersing moisture in the air. The wind direction was predominantly from the north, shifting slightly between north-northeast and north-northwest, which is consistent with the cooler temperatures observed.
