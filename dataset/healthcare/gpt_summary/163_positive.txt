Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable increase in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the ratio peaking at 26.24% in week 14 before declining to 14.94% by week 20. Influenza A remains the predominant strain, accounting for most of the positive cases, reaching a high of 25.36% positivity in week 14 and then decreasing to 13.32% by week 20. Despite being less prevalent, the Influenza B positivity ratio has shown a gradual increase, rising from 0.31% in week 1 to 1.63% in week 20. The total number of specimens tested peaked at 54,061 in week 14, correlating with the highest positivity rates observed, indicating a potential surge in influenza activity during this period. The recent downward trend in both the number of specimens tested and the positivity rates suggests a possible decrease in influenza activity, which could alleviate some of the burden on healthcare resources.
