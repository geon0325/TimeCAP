Over the past 20 weeks, the data indicates a concerning upward trend in the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia relative to total deaths, starting at 5.41% and escalating to 9.15%, which is significantly higher than the average ratio of 7.84%. This increase suggests that Influenza and Pneumonia are becoming more prevalent or severe causes of death. The number of deaths from Influenza has risen sharply from 22 in the first week to 993 in the last week, while deaths from Pneumonia have also shown a significant increase from 3038 to 5428 in the same period. The total number of deaths has also been on an upward trajectory, starting at 56,569 and reaching 70,168 by the end of the 20-week period. These trends could indicate a strain on healthcare resources and may necessitate a public health response to address the growing impact of respiratory illnesses on mortality.
