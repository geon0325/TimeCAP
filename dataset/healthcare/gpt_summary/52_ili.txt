The review of the past 20 weeks of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data reveals that there was a significant period where the ratio of ILI patients exceeded the baseline threshold, indicating a heightened level of ILI activity within the population. Notably, the age group of 5-24 experienced the highest count of ILI patients, which could suggest a higher transmission rate in schools or among young adults. However, following this peak period, there has been a consistent decline in the ratio of ILI patients across all age groups, indicating a subsiding of ILI cases. The sustained decrease to below the baseline in recent weeks signals a return to lower levels of ILI incidence, which may reduce the burden on healthcare resources. Nonetheless, continued surveillance is critical to monitor for potential fluctuations and to manage healthcare resources efficiently.
