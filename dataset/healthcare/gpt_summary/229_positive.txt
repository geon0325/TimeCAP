Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a substantial decline in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the initial weeks showing a peak ratio of 25.75% that dramatically decreased to 0.17% in the most recent week. The number of specimens tested remained relatively high throughout the period, although it showed some fluctuations and a general decreasing trend, suggesting a sustained effort in surveillance despite varying levels of influenza activity. Influenza A has been the predominant strain throughout the period, with its peak positivity ratio of 18.76% decreasing to 0.09%, indicating a significant reduction in its circulation. Influenza B showed a similar downward trend, yet it has consistently represented a smaller proportion of the positive cases, with its highest ratio at 6.99% dropping to 0.08%. The overall reduction in influenza positivity rates suggests a current low level of influenza transmission, which may lead to a decrease in related healthcare demand, but continuous monitoring is essential to detect any potential resurgence.
