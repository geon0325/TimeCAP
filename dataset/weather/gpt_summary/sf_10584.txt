Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperature has exhibited a natural diurnal cycle with a noticeable dip during the early morning hours before gradually warming up towards the afternoon. Humidity levels varied significantly, with a marked increase during the night, which might be associated with the typical coastal influence of marine air, leading to a higher likelihood of morning fog that San Francisco is known for. Air pressure remained relatively stable, although there was a slight downward trend towards the end of the period, which could indicate an approaching weather system that may affect local conditions in the near future. Wind speeds were generally light and showed little variation, while wind direction was more variable, with shifts from calm conditions to a predominantly northwesterly flow, which is common for this region and can bring cooler, oceanic air inland. Overall, these conditions are typical for San Francisco's climate, with no immediate indicators of severe weather events on the horizon.
