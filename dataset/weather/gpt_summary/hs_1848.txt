Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual decline in temperature followed by a moderate increase, indicating a typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels were exceptionally high during the night and early morning hours, suggesting the presence of moisture that could lead to foggy conditions, but as the day progressed, a significant drop in humidity was observed.
