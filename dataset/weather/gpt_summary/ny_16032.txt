Over the last 24 hours, New York City has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperatures, with a general trend of cooling during the night and warming up during the day, which is typical of the diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels showed a notable increase towards the late evening and early morning hours, possibly contributing to a feeling of increased mugginess or potential for early morning fog. Air pressure remained relatively stable, indicating a period of consistent weather patterns without immediate signs of significant weather fronts or storms approaching. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with the calmest conditions in the late evening, which would have minimal impact on urban activities but could lead to the accumulation of pollutants in the absence of stronger winds. Wind direction varied throughout the day, predominantly coming from the south and shifting slightly, which might have influenced the temperature and humidity levels experienced in the city.
