The analysis of the 20-week Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data indicates a decreasing trend in the percentage of ILI patients, with the current ratio falling below the baseline of 2.9%. This suggests a decline in the prevalence of ILI symptoms among the patient population. Notably, every age group has shown a reduction in the number of ILI cases, with the most significant decrease observed in the 0-4 years age group, followed by the 5-24 years age group. The consistent decrease in ILI ratios could potentially result in a reduced burden on healthcare resources dedicated to managing acute respiratory infections. However, vigilance is still required as the ILI ratios, even though below the threshold, may fluctuate, and healthcare providers should be prepared to respond to any potential resurgence.
