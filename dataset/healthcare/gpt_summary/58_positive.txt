Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant increase in the percentage of positive respiratory specimens for influenza, with a peak observed in week 14 at 24.73%, and subsequently declining to 18.48% by week 20. Notably, Influenza A has shown a marked prevalence over Influenza B, peaking at a 20.21% positivity rate in week 14 but decreasing to 7.22% by the last week. In contrast, the rate of positive specimens for Influenza B has steadily increased, reaching its highest at 11.26% in week 20, suggesting a potential shift in the dominant influenza strain. The total number of specimens tested peaked at 49,356 in week 14, coinciding with the highest combined positivity rate, indicating a possible surge in flu cases during that period. These trends highlight the need for continued surveillance and resource allocation in the healthcare system to manage the evolving impact of influenza.
