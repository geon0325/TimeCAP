Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, with the warmest conditions occurring in the late afternoon, indicative of a typical diurnal pattern. During this time, the relative humidity showed a notable decrease, suggesting an inverse relationship with the rising temperatures. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, indicating no significant frontal systems affecting the area. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a slight uptick in the later hours, which could contribute to a perceived decrease in temperature due to the wind chill effect. The wind direction was predominantly southerly to southwesterly, which in Houston is often associated with warm air advection from the Gulf of Mexico, potentially contributing to the overall rise in temperatures.
