Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable increase in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the average ratio of positive specimens rising from 2.17% to 26.13%. The number of specimens tested for influenza peaked at 54,030 in week 15, while the incidence of positive cases for Influenza A has consistently been higher than for Influenza B, peaking at a 25.36% positivity rate in week 17. The ratio of Influenza A to B indicates that Influenza A has been the dominant strain throughout the period. Despite fluctuations, an overall upward trend in the percentage of positive specimens suggests an increasing prevalence of influenza, which could indicate a surge in cases that may strain healthcare resources. The recent uptick in the Influenza B positivity rate to 1.07% in week 20, the highest in the observed period, warrants attention for potential shifts in dominant strains and implications for treatment and prevention strategies.
