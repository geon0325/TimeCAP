Over the past 20 weeks, the data indicates a fluctuating pattern in the incidence of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) across different age groups. After an initial period below the baseline, the ILI ratio surpassed the threshold, suggesting a significant increase in ILI cases, especially marked in the age groups 0-4 and 5-24, which saw a substantial rise in patient count. The peak of ILI activity was observed mid-period, with the highest ratios recorded, indicating a period of intense ILI spread that could have strained healthcare resources. Following this peak, there has been a gradual decline in ILI percentages across all age groups, yet the figures have remained above the baseline for several weeks, which may still indicate a higher demand for healthcare services related to ILI. As the latest data shows a downward trend towards the baseline, it is important for healthcare providers to continue monitoring these trends for any signs of resurgence and to allocate resources effectively to manage potential outbreaks.
