Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable increase in the proportion of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the overall positivity rate rising from 0.77% to a peak of 18.27% before declining to 13.80% in the most recent week. Influenza A has been the predominant strain, with its positivity rate climbing from 0.49% to 14.99%, although it has recently decreased to 11.13%. Meanwhile, Influenza B has shown a similar upward trend, starting at 0.28% and reaching a maximum of 3.28%, followed by a decrease to 2.66%. The increasing positivity rates indicate a significant influenza activity, which peaked around weeks 18-19 and has since shown a slight decline. These trends underscore the need for heightened healthcare preparedness, including increased resources for testing, vaccination, and treatment, to manage the seasonal surge in influenza cases.
