Over the last 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, transitioning from below-freezing conditions to slightly above freezing by the end of the period. Humidity levels started relatively moderate but peaked at 100% before settling back to moderate levels, suggesting the possibility of fog or precipitation during the peak. Air pressure has shown a consistent downward trend, indicating the potential for worsening weather conditions, such as increased cloudiness or storm development. Wind speeds have been generally light with some variability, including a period of increased speed, which could contribute to wind chill effects, particularly when temperatures were at their lowest. The wind direction varied widely throughout the period, which could have led to shifting weather patterns and inconsistent conditions.
