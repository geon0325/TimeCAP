Over the last 24 hours, the weather in Houston has exhibited a gradual decrease in temperature, reaching its lowest value overnight before steadily climbing back up throughout the day. Humidity levels started moderately, increasing significantly during the early morning hours, indicative of possible morning fog or dew, and then sharply declined as temperatures rose, suggesting a drier atmosphere later in the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a sudden notable drop and a quick recovery, likely associated with a transient weather system that may have led to short-term changes in weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a brief period of higher speeds, possibly signaling the passage of a front or weather disturbance. The wind direction varied, with a tendency to shift from northerly to easterly, and then to varying degrees throughout the period, which could have influenced local temperature and humidity patterns.
