Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable diurnal fluctuation in temperature with a cooler period during the early hours, followed by a warming trend as the day progressed, and a slight drop again in the later hours. Humidity levels remained high throughout the day, with a peak in the early morning hours, which could contribute to a feeling of mugginess and potential for morning fog. Air pressure experienced a gradual decrease, indicating a potential change in weather patterns, such as the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a significant increase observed during the afternoon, and the predominant wind direction shifted notably from northeasterly to varying directions including a southerly component in the afternoon, which could signal the arrival of different air masses. Overall, these indicators suggest a stable weather pattern with the possibility of some changes in the coming hours, particularly in wind direction and air pressure that may affect local weather conditions.
