Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature with a general cooling trend during the early hours, followed by a warming trend peaking in the late afternoon and then tapering off slightly. Humidity levels showed an inverse relationship with temperature, reaching their highest as the temperature dropped and vice versa, suggesting a typical diurnal pattern. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase toward the end of the period, indicating steady weather conditions with no immediate signs of significant weather systems moving in. Wind speeds were light to moderate throughout the day with some increase around midday, which could have contributed to the dispersal of humidity and a more comfortable feel in the air. The wind direction was predominantly from the north to northeast, shifting more easterly at times, which is consistent with a cooler and drier air mass affecting the area.
