Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable increase in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia in relation to the total number of deaths, starting from below average at 5.85% and rising sharply to a peak of 14.40% in the final week. This uptrend is concurrent with the growth in absolute numbers, with the deaths attributable to Influenza or Pneumonia growing from 3209 to 10387, a more than threefold increase. The total number of deaths also surged in the last week to 72145, a significant jump compared to the previous weeks, suggesting a potential exacerbation in overall mortality. The rise in Influenza and Pneumonia deaths, particularly the rapid ascent in the latter weeks, could indicate an outbreak or a seasonal spike, necessitating heightened healthcare resources and public health interventions. This trend, if sustained or unmitigated, could place considerable strain on the healthcare system, emphasizing the need for immediate attention to respiratory illness prevention and control strategies.
