Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a notable fluctuation in temperature, with a peak during the earlier hours and a gradual decrease towards the latter part of the time series, indicative of a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels started relatively low but increased significantly, maintaining high values throughout most of the period, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air which could be associated with foggy or overcast conditions. Air pressure showed a substantial increase at one point, which could signal the movement of a high-pressure system into the area, often associated with clearer skies and calmer weather. Wind speeds varied minimally, mostly staying on the lower end of the scale, which could result in stagnant air conditions and potentially contribute to the build-up of pollutants or allergens. The wind direction was predominantly from the west and southwest, which is typical for San Francisco's climate, influenced by maritime air masses coming from the Pacific Ocean.
