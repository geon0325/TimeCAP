The time-series data over the last 20 weeks indicates a peak in the ratio of positive specimens for influenza at 23.65% in week 5, followed by a general declining trend to 1.71% by week 20. Influenza A has been the predominant strain, with its highest positivity rate at 18.16% in week 5, decreasing to 0.59% in week 20, while Influenza B peaked slightly later at 6.69% in week 10 and decreased to 1.12% by week 20. The overall ratio of positive specimens has consistently remained above the 20-week average of 6.26% until week 15, suggesting a significant burden on the healthcare system during this period. The declining trend in positive cases indicates a potential easing of the healthcare burden related to influenza. However, continued surveillance is necessary to monitor for potential resurgences or new strains that may impact public health.
