The data indicates a steady increase in the ratio of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) patients over the last 20 weeks, with the percentage exceeding the baseline of 2.9% in the latter part of the period, suggesting a significant uptick in ILI cases. Notably, the highest increases in ILI cases are seen among the age groups 5-24 and 25-49, with these demographics showing a pronounced surge that could suggest higher transmission rates or increased susceptibility. The consistent rise in ILI cases across all age groups, but particularly in the working-age population, could put a strain on healthcare resources and impact workforce productivity. The latest weeks show the ratio of ILI patients reaching its peak, indicating an ongoing upward trend which may necessitate public health interventions. The healthcare system may need to prepare for continued increases in patient volume, potentially reallocating resources to cope with the rising demand for medical care associated with ILI symptoms.
