Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has exhibited a slight diurnal variation with cooler temperatures during the early morning hours, followed by a modest increase towards the afternoon. Humidity levels have remained high, suggesting a muggy atmosphere, but showed a noticeable decrease in the later hours, which could indicate a shift towards drier conditions. Air pressure has been steadily rising, which is typically associated with the approach or presence of a high-pressure system, often leading to stable and clearer weather conditions. Wind speeds have been moderate, with a slight decreasing trend, and the wind direction has been predominantly from the northwest, shifting slightly to the north-northwest, which may contribute to the gradual changes in temperature and humidity experienced.
