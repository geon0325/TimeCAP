Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a fluctuation in the number of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with an average positivity rate of 6.26%. The ratio of positive specimens reached its lowest at 1.90% and peaked at 3.84%, indicating a variability in influenza incidence. The data shows a higher prevalence of Influenza B, especially in recent weeks, with its positivity ratio surpassing that of Influenza A, which could suggest a shift in the dominant strain or a seasonal variation. Notably, there was a significant increase in the number of positive Influenza B specimens in the last week, jumping from 180 to 253, which may indicate an emerging trend or outbreak that could strain healthcare resources. Overall, the fluctuating but persistent presence of influenza necessitates continued surveillance and preparedness in the healthcare system to manage potential increases in patient volume.
