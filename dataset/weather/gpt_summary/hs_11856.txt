Over the last 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual rise in temperature, indicating a warming trend. Humidity levels fluctuated but showed a slight decrease towards the latter part of the period, which, combined with increasing temperatures, could lead to a perception of more comfortable conditions. Air pressure gradually decreased, suggesting a potential change in weather patterns or an approaching weather system. Wind speeds were generally low, with occasional calm conditions, and the primary wind direction shifted significantly only towards the end of the period, which might hint at a change in the local weather dynamics. Overall, the combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and falling air pressure could signal the onset of a new weather front, affecting conditions in the near future.
