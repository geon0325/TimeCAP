Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a decrease in temperature during the early hours, followed by a gradual warming trend as the day progressed, which is typical for the coastal climate influenced by maritime air masses. The humidity levels varied significantly, with notably high values during the cooler early morning hours, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air that could lead to foggy conditions, particularly in areas close to the water. Air pressure saw a substantial drop during the day, which typically indicates an approaching weather system that might result in unsettled weather, including increased cloudiness or precipitation. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with a peak in the afternoon, and the wind direction shifted throughout the day, indicating variable weather patterns and the possible passage of a frontal system. Overall, these fluctuations in weather parameters point towards a dynamic weather situation with the potential for changes in cloud cover, visibility, and possibly precipitation in the near term.
