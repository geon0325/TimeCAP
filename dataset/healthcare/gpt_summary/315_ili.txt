Over the last 20 weeks, the ratio of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) patients remained consistently below the baseline threshold of 2.9%, suggesting a relatively stable influenza activity within the monitored population. However, there has been a gradual increase in the ILI ratio, with a slight dip towards the end of the observed period before rising again to match the previous peak. The age group 0-4 years has shown a noticeable uptick in ILI cases, indicating heightened vulnerability or increased exposure among young children. All other age groups experienced fluctuations in ILI cases, with the 65 or more age group having the least variation and maintaining the lowest numbers throughout the period. These patterns suggest that while the overall ILI activity remains below the baseline, monitoring and preparedness should be focused on the youngest age group, which is currently showing an upward trend in ILI cases.
