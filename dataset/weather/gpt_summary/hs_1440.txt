Over the last 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have experienced a gradual increase, indicating a warming trend that peaked during the late afternoon before slightly decreasing towards the evening. Humidity levels remained high throughout the period, which, combined with the rising temperatures, could have contributed to a muggy and uncomfortable atmosphere. Air pressure showed a slight but steady decline, suggesting a possible change in weather patterns or the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds were generally light to gentle and exhibited minimal variation, with wind direction predominantly from the east to southeast, which is typical for this region. The combination of high humidity, rising temperatures, and decreasing air pressure could lead to the development of clouds and potential precipitation if the trend continues.
