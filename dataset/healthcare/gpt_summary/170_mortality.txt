Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to total deaths has shown a general decreasing trend, starting from a high of 15.78% and ending at 9.58%, which is above the average ratio of 7.84%. The total number of deaths fluctuated, with an initial decrease from 78,946 to 58,804, followed by a slight increase, and then a gradual decline to 62,440 in the final week. Deaths from pneumonia have consistently outnumbered those from influenza, with pneumonia deaths decreasing from 11,988 to 5,968, while influenza deaths showed a significant drop early in the period from 473 to 11, followed by minor fluctuations. The peak mortality ratio from these respiratory conditions in week 1 suggests a potential seasonal impact or an outbreak, but the consistent decline thereafter could indicate a subsiding pattern or effectiveness of public health interventions. The data suggest a significant burden on the healthcare system at the start of the period, which may have gradually eased, but the consistently higher ratios compared to the average indicate a sustained pressure on healthcare resources for managing respiratory illnesses.
