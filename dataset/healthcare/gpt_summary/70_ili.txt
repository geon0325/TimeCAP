Over the last 20 weeks, the data shows a consistent decline in the overall number of patients experiencing Influenza-like Illness (ILI), with the youngest age group (0-4 years) persistently having the highest count of ILI cases compared to other age groups. Despite a general downward trend in ILI cases, there has been a notable upswing in recent weeks, particularly in the 5-24 and 0-4 age brackets. Throughout the period, the ratio of ILI patients to total patients has remained significantly below the baseline threshold used to determine heightened influenza activity, indicating a relatively mild ILI season thus far. However, the gradual increase in the ILI ratio in the latest weeks suggests a potential uptick in ILI prevalence that warrants close monitoring. The healthcare system should be alert to these trends to manage resources effectively and prepare for any potential increase in demand for healthcare services related to ILI.
