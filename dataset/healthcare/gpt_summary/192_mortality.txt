Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant fluctuation in the mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia in comparison to the total number of deaths. The data indicates a concerning spike in the ratio of deaths from Influenza or Pneumonia to total deaths in the last four weeks, with values ranging from 17.54% to 19.40%, which far exceed the 20-week average of 7.84%. This surge is primarily due to an exceptionally high number of pneumonia-related deaths during this period, notably in the 16th week, where the total deaths peaked at 86,888 and pneumonia deaths at 16,800, contributing to the highest ratio observed. The number of deaths specifically from influenza remained relatively low and stable, suggesting that pneumonia is the driving factor behind the increased mortality ratio. These trends indicate a potential stress on healthcare resources and could signal the need for increased vigilance and healthcare response to respiratory illnesses, particularly pneumonia.
