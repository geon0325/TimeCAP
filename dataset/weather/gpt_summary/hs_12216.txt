Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, indicating a warming trend that peaked in the late afternoon before slightly cooling off. Humidity levels remained high throughout the day, with a period of full saturation during the early morning hours likely contributing to foggy conditions or dew. The air pressure has been relatively stable, showing minor fluctuations which are typical for the region and suggest stable weather patterns in the short term. Wind speeds were generally light and variable, with occasional calm periods; however, there was an increase in wind velocity towards the evening, which could have helped to disperse humidity and clear any earlier fog or mist. Notably, the wind direction shifted from easterly in the early hours to predominantly westerly by the end of the day, which may signal a change in weather systems affecting the area.
