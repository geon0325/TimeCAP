Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual decline in temperature from its peak during the day to a cooler temperature by night, following a typical diurnal pattern. The relative humidity has shown an inverse relationship with temperature, increasing as the night progressed and decreasing as the temperatures rose again. Air pressure remained relatively stable and high throughout the period, suggesting stable weather conditions. Wind speeds were mostly light and variable, with a slight increase in the early morning hours, which is common as the land cools. Finally, the predominant wind direction was from the south-southeast, which is typical for Houston and can contribute to warmer, more humid conditions due to the flow of air from the Gulf of Mexico.
