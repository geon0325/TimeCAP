Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality rate from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to total deaths has been consistently below the average ratio of 7.84%, with the lowest recorded at 5.36% and the highest at 6.19%. The total number of deaths fluctuated, with the lowest count at 49,362 and the highest at 52,143, but without a clear upward or downward trend. Deaths from pneumonia were notably higher than those from influenza, with pneumonia accounting for a significant majority of the combined mortality. The ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia has shown slight variability but remained within a narrow range of 5.36% to 6.19%, indicating a relatively stable pattern in this period. Given the consistent proportion of deaths from these respiratory conditions below the average rate, it may suggest either an overall reduction in their impact or improvements in treatment and prevention, which could alleviate some pressures on the healthcare system.
