Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a significant fluctuation in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a peak ratio of 27.37% in week 10 decreasing to 12.69% by week 20. Influenza A showed a more pronounced peak earlier in the time series with a high of 21.62% positivity in week 6, followed by a decline to 4.14% by week 20, indicating a subsiding wave of Influenza A infections. Conversely, Influenza B displayed a steady increase in its positivity ratio up to week 14, reaching 10.95%, and then a gradual decline to 8.55% by week 20, suggesting a later peak in Influenza B activity relative to Influenza A. The overall decrease in the positivity rate for both strains in the latter weeks may indicate a downtrend in influenza activity; however, healthcare systems should remain vigilant as the combined positivity rate remains above the 20-week average of 6.26%. The data underscores the need for continued influenza surveillance, vaccination efforts, and resource allocation to manage potential surges and protect vulnerable populations.
