Over the past 20 weeks, the percentage of patients presenting with Influenza-like Illness (ILI) has shown a marked decline, transitioning from well above the baseline in the initial weeks to consistently below the baseline in the most recent weeks. This decline is observed across all age groups, with the most significant decreases noted in the younger populations (ages 0-4 and 5-24), which initially had the highest counts of ILI cases. The reduction in ILI incidence is indicative of a waning influenza season or effective public health interventions. However, the sustained number of ILI cases in the older age groups (ages 50 and above), although decreasing, warrants continued monitoring due to potential complications and the healthcare system burden associated with this demographic. The current trend, if continued, suggests a relieving pressure on the healthcare system, but vigilance is required to manage and respond to any unexpected upticks in ILI activity.
