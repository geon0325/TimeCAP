Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature with a general cooling trend towards the early hours followed by a warming trend later in the day. Humidity levels were high, staying mostly above average, indicative of a potentially damp atmosphere which could have resulted in foggy conditions, especially during the early morning and late evening when humidity peaked. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with a minor decreasing trend, which is unlikely to have a significant impact on the weather pattern in the short term. Wind speeds were mostly light to gentle, with no significant gusts, suggesting a calm weather period. The wind direction varied but predominantly came from the west-northwest, which is typical for this region and may have contributed to the maritime air influence on the city's weather.
