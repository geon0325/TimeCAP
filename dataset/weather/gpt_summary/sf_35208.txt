Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable fluctuation in temperature, which began at a relatively high point, dipped significantly during the cooler nighttime hours, and then rose again. Humidity levels increased as the temperature dropped, indicating a typical diurnal pattern where the air can hold less moisture when it's cooler, and peaked during the night and early morning before decreasing as temperatures climbed. Air pressure remained fairly steady throughout the period, with a slight decrease observed towards the end of the 24 hours, which could suggest a minor change in weather conditions approaching. Wind speeds were generally light and variable, with a brief period of calm conditions, suggesting a tranquil weather pattern without significant wind-related impacts. Wind direction shifted throughout the day, predominantly coming from the north and northwest, but ended with a notable shift to coming from the west-southwest, which could influence coastal weather conditions and potentially bring in moisture from the ocean.
