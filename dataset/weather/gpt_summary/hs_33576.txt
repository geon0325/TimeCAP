Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have experienced a moderate fluctuation, initially decreasing during the early hours, followed by a significant increase towards the afternoon, and then stabilizing in the evening. Humidity levels showed a marked variation, with very high humidity in the morning, which then decreased sharply as the day progressed, potentially indicating the presence of morning dew or fog that cleared later on. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with a slight increase towards the afternoon, suggesting stable weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to gentle, with an increase in speed observed in the late evening hours, which could contribute to a slight cooling effect. The wind direction was predominantly from the south to south-east, shifting more towards the south-west later in the day, which is typical for Houston and could be associated with the movement of a weather system in the area.
