Over the last 20 weeks, data indicates an increasing trend in the mortality ratio from influenza and pneumonia relative to total deaths, with the ratio rising from 5.26% to 7.31%. Notably, the increase in deaths attributed to influenza has been significant, with a more than thirtyfold rise from 14 to 480 deaths per week. Deaths from pneumonia have also increased but at a slower rate, from 2709 to 3810 deaths per week. The peak mortality ratio of 7.64% in recent weeks surpasses the 20-week average of 7.84%, suggesting a worsening impact of these respiratory illnesses on overall mortality. This trend could indicate a growing burden on healthcare resources and necessitates increased vigilance and potentially enhanced public health measures to manage the spread and impact of these diseases.
