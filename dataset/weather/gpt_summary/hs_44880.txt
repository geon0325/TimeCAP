Over the past 24 hours, the temperature in Houston has experienced a typical diurnal cycle, starting and ending in cooler conditions with a noticeable peak during the afternoon hours, indicative of seasonally expected behavior. Humidity levels have been high throughout the period, reaching their maximum in the early morning, which could have contributed to a feeling of mugginess, particularly when temperatures were at their highest. Air pressure has remained relatively steady with only minor fluctuations, suggesting a stable weather pattern without the presence of significant frontal systems. Wind speeds have been mostly light to moderate, with no significant gusts, indicating a generally calm wind regime. The wind direction has varied, with occasional shifts, but predominantly southeasterly winds prevailed, which is typical for the Houston area and may influence moisture levels due to the proximity of the Gulf of Mexico.
