Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has experienced a gradual decline overnight, reaching its lowest point in the early morning before rising steadily throughout the day to peak in the late afternoon. Concurrently, humidity levels have shown an inverse relationship to temperature, with higher humidity occurring during the cooler morning hours and lower humidity as the temperature increased. Atmospheric pressure has remained relatively stable, with only minor fluctuations, indicating a period of stable weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to gentle and increased towards the end of the 24-hour period, which could contribute to a slight wind chill effect during the cooler evening hours. The wind direction has been predominantly from the south to southeast, with some variability, which is typical for Houston and may bring moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, potentially impacting local humidity levels.
