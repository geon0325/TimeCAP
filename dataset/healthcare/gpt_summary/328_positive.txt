Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a fluctuating trend in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with an overall average positivity rate of 6.26%. The peak positivity rate occurred at week 13 with 9.89%, while the latest week shows a decline to 4.90%. Influenza A has been the predominant strain throughout the period, reaching its highest positivity rate of 9.85% in week 13, but it has since decreased to 4.84% in the latest week. Conversely, Influenza B has remained a minor contributor to the overall positivity rate, with a peak of 0.17% at week 11, and a slight increase from 0.03% to 0.06% in the most recent weeks. This trend suggests a subsiding wave of influenza A, although healthcare systems should remain vigilant for potential changes in the pattern, especially with the slight uptick in influenza B detections.
