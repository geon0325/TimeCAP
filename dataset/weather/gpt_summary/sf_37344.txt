Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have experienced a slight fluctuation, generally decreasing during the early hours and then rising again, indicative of the typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels have shown significant variability, with periods of complete saturation suggesting the possibility of fog or mist, particularly during times when temperature and humidity values were both high. Air pressure has been fairly stable, with a slight decreasing trend, which could be associated with the approach of a weak weather system. Wind speeds have remained mostly light to gentle, with occasional moderate gusts, and the wind direction has been predominantly from the north to the northwest, which is common for the region. The combination of high humidity, light winds, and stable air pressure points to calm weather conditions, with the potential for morning coastal fog that clears as the day progresses.
