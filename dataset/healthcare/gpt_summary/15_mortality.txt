Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable downward trend in the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, with the percentage decreasing from 6.88% to 5.36%, remaining consistently below the 20-week average of 7.84%. The number of deaths from Influenza has significantly decreased, from 162 to 7, suggesting an effective response to influenza-related health challenges or seasonal variations. However, deaths from pneumonia have shown less fluctuation, with initial numbers at 3489, decreasing to a low of 2695, and slightly increasing again to 2716, indicating a persistent burden on healthcare resources from pneumonia. The overall trend in total deaths has been relatively stable, with minor fluctuations, suggesting that the observed changes in Influenza or Pneumonia mortality are not due to overall mortality but to specific changes in the incidence or management of these conditions. This data highlights the need for continued monitoring and targeted healthcare interventions to address pneumonia, alongside a successful approach towards managing influenza that should be maintained or adapted as necessary with seasonal trends.
