Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a gradual increase in the percentage of deaths due to Influenza or Pneumonia relative to total mortality, rising from 5.11% to 7.55%, which exceeds the average ratio of mortality from these diseases (7.84%) in the most recent week reported. The total number of deaths has also shown an upward trend, with a significant spike in the final week to 60,028. Notably, deaths from Influenza have seen a sharp rise in the last week, jumping from 141 to 432, which is a potential indicator of an Influenza outbreak. Deaths from Pneumonia have consistently contributed more to the overall mortality ratio compared to Influenza, but both have shown an increasing trend over the period analyzed. The observed trends indicate a growing burden on the healthcare system and may necessitate increased healthcare resources and public health interventions to manage the rise in Influenza and Pneumonia-related mortality.
