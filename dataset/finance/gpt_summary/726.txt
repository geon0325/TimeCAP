Over the past 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with a general decline in the earlier days followed by a partial recovery, closing slightly above the 20-day period's opening value, indicating a potential stabilization after initial fluctuations. The VIX, which gauges market volatility, experienced a significant spike mid-period, correlating with the S&P 500's downturn, but has since receded towards its initial levels, suggesting a decrease in investor anxiety. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 both reflected similar trends of initial decline with subsequent recovery, albeit the FTSE 100 closed noticeably lower than its starting point, which may reflect region-specific market concerns. Gold futures saw a decline over the period, indicating a possible shift in investor sentiment towards riskier assets, as supported by the partial recovery in equity indices. The currency markets showed relative stability in the EUR/USD and USD/CNY exchange rates, while the USD/JPY experienced a slight appreciation, potentially indicating a modest strengthening of the dollar or a shift in regional economic expectations.
