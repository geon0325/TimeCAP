Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a mild decrease in temperature following a peak during the earlier hours, suggesting a typical diurnal pattern with cooler conditions prevailing into the night. Humidity levels have shown variability, with a significant increase during the night which could have led to a perception of chillier conditions or the formation of fog, a common occurrence in the region. Air pressure remained relatively stable initially but increased significantly later on, potentially indicating the arrival of a high-pressure system that could lead to clearer skies and calmer conditions. Wind speeds were consistently light throughout the period, with some variability in direction, which is characteristic of coastal areas where local breezes can be influenced by land-sea interactions. A notable shift in wind direction from westerly to variable directions, and then settling into an easterly flow, could suggest changing weather patterns, possibly influenced by local topography or larger-scale weather systems moving through the area.
