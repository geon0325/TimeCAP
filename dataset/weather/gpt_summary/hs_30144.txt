Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature with a general trend of cooling overnight followed by a warming trend during the day. Humidity levels were quite high, peaking at saturation in the early hours, which could have implications for fog or dew formation, potentially affecting visibility conditions in the morning. Air pressure showed a slight variability but ended on a higher note, which may indicate a transient high-pressure system moving over the area, possibly leading to clearer skies. Wind speeds were mostly light to gentle, with a few periods of moderate speed, and the wind direction shifted throughout the day, suggesting the presence of varying weather fronts or local breeze effects. These combined atmospheric conditions point to a dynamic weather pattern with changes in cloud cover and the possibility of morning fog or dew, followed by clearer conditions as the air pressure rose.
