Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a general downward trend in the proportion of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a notable decline from 13.24% in the first week to 1.40% in the final week. The incidence of Influenza A has decreased more significantly than Influenza B, as demonstrated by the drop in positive specimen percentages from 6.95% to 1.01% for Influenza A, compared to a less steep decline from 6.29% to 0.40% for Influenza B. This suggests that Influenza A was more prevalent at the start of the period but decreased more rapidly than Influenza B. The overall ratio of 6.26% positive specimens across the 20 weeks is skewed by the higher rates in the initial weeks, indicating that the latter weeks have seen ratios well below the average. This declining trend in influenza positivity suggests a decrease in the spread or incidence of the disease, which could potentially lessen the burden on healthcare resources dedicated to managing influenza cases.
