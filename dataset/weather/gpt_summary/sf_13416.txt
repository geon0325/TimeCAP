Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have exhibited a typical diurnal pattern with a peak during the afternoon hours and a noticeable dip overnight, indicating a relatively stable weather pattern without extreme variations. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with a peak during the early morning hours that could have resulted in a feeling of higher chill factor or potential for morning fog, which is common in coastal areas like San Francisco. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout most of the period but showed a sharp decrease towards the end of the 24-hour window, which could suggest the approach of a new weather system, potentially bringing changes in weather conditions. Wind speed varied moderately, with periods of calm interspersed with breezier conditions; however, no strong gusts were observed, suggesting that winds did not have a severe impact on the local weather. Finally, wind direction was predominantly from the west and northwest, which is typical for San Francisco's climate and indicates the influence of oceanic winds on the city's weather.
