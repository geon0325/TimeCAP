Over the last 20 weeks, the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia to total deaths fluctuated below the average of 7.84%, with the exception of the last two weeks, where there was a sharp increase to 14.15% and 13.15%, respectively. This sudden rise in the ratio coincides with a substantial increase in total deaths, from an average of around 58,000 to 68,969 and 67,422 in the final two weeks. The number of deaths attributed solely to influenza remained relatively low and stable, with a slight decline towards the end of the period, suggesting that pneumonia was the primary driver of the increased mortality ratio. The number of deaths from pneumonia showed a significant spike in the last two weeks, aligning with the overall increase in deaths and the higher ratio of Influenza or Pneumonia mortality. This trend indicates a potential outbreak or a seasonal increase in severity, warranting close monitoring and possibly an urgent healthcare response to address the sudden escalation in pneumonia-related mortality.
