Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a mild and consistent temperature drop, which reached its lowest point just before sunrise, typical of the diurnal pattern. The humidity levels were significantly high throughout the period, peaking at full saturation during the early morning hours, which likely led to foggy conditions, particularly when coupled with stable high air pressure. Speaking of pressure, it remained relatively steady, indicating stable weather conditions with a slight decrease towards the end of the period that could suggest a minor change in weather patterns approaching. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a gradual increase towards the latest hours, which could contribute to a dispersal of the morning fog as the day progresses. The wind direction shifted from westerly to a more southerly direction throughout the day, which is consistent with the passage of a weather front and could result in a change in weather conditions, potentially bringing clearer skies or a change in temperature.
