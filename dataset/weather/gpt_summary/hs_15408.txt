Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual rise in temperature, peaking during the afternoon hours, which is typical for this subtropical region. Humidity levels have remained very high for the majority of the day, hitting saturation at several points, which could lead to a muggy and uncomfortable atmosphere for residents, and potentially trigger the development of fog and mist in the early morning. Air pressure has shown a slight but consistent decrease throughout the period, suggesting an increasing likelihood of changing weather patterns, possibly indicating an approaching weather system. Wind speeds have been relatively light but increased in the later hours, which can help to disperse humidity and may bring a slight relief from the heat. The wind direction has been variable, although predominantly coming from the south to southeast, which is in line with the warm temperatures observed, as it is likely bringing warm air from the Gulf of Mexico inland.
