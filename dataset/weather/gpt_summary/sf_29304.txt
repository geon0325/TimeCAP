Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a noticeable decrease in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a gradual warming trend peaking in the late afternoon. Concurrently, humidity levels exhibited significant fluctuations, with particularly high values in the early morning, indicative of possible fog or mist, and very low levels towards the afternoon, which could lead to drier conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight tendency to increase, suggesting steady weather patterns without the immediate approach of significant weather fronts. Wind speeds were generally light, with some increase in the afternoon, which might have contributed to the dispersal of any early moisture and a decrease in humidity. The wind direction varied considerably, with notable shifts from north-easterly to southerly, then predominantly north-westerly, potentially influencing local temperature variations and the movement of marine air masses inland.
