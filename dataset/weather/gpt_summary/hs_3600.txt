Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, reaching its lowest point in the early morning before slowly climbing back up. The humidity levels have shown a corresponding inverse relationship to temperature changes, with an increase during the cooler early morning hours and a decrease as temperatures rose. Air pressure remained relatively stable and high throughout the period, suggesting that the weather has been and will likely remain settled and dry. Wind speeds were moderate to light, with some variability, but without significant gusts, indicating no immediate concern for wind-related weather events. The wind direction was primarily from the north-northwest, shifting slightly throughout the day, which is typical for the region and does not suggest any drastic weather changes imminently.
