Over the last 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable upward trend in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before gradually tapering off. Humidity levels started high during the early hours, peaking at saturation during the morning, but significantly dropped as the temperature rose, indicating a possible heat-induced lowering of relative humidity. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with only minor fluctuations, suggesting a steady atmospheric condition without the immediate presence of strong weather fronts. Wind speed varied slightly, generally remaining light to gentle, with a more pronounced increase towards the current hour, which could contribute to a slight cooling effect. The wind direction was predominantly southerly, shifting to a more westerly direction later in the day, which could be associated with the movement of weather systems across the region.
