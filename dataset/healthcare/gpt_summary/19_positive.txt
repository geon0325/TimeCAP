Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a consistent decline in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for both influenza A and B, with the initial ratios of 11.52% and 4.01% decreasing to 0.41% and 0.81%, respectively. The peak positivity occurred between weeks 3 and 4, with influenza A reaching its highest at 18.16% and influenza B at 5.49%, after which a steady decrease was observed. Despite a fluctuating volume of specimens tested, the overall trend shows a reduction in the number of positive specimens, aligning with the declining positivity ratios. The current low positivity rate of 1.22% suggests a significant decrease in influenza activity, which could indicate a potential easing of the burden on healthcare resources related to influenza cases. However, continuous surveillance is essential to monitor for potential resurgences or seasonal variations that could impact the healthcare system in the future.
