Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a general warming trend with temperatures reaching their peak in the late afternoon before gradually starting to decrease. Humidity levels were high throughout the day, hitting saturation during the early morning hours, which could have led to morning fog or dew; however, humidity decreased as temperatures rose. Air pressure showed a slight but steady decrease, suggesting a potential change in the weather pattern, such as the approach of a weather front. Wind speeds were mostly light and variable, with a notable increase towards the current hour, which could influence the dispersion of any localized air pollution. Wind direction varied significantly, with a tendency towards southeasterly winds, shifting to a southerly and then southwesterly direction, which is typical for bringing warmer air masses into the Houston area.
