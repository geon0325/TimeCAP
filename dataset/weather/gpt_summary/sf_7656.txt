Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, transitioning from warmer to cooler conditions. Humidity levels have shown a significant increase through the night, reaching very high levels, which may have led to a feeling of increased mugginess or potential fog development. Air pressure remained relatively stable with only minor fluctuations, indicating a period of steady weather without the immediate approach of significant weather systems. Wind speeds were generally light and variable, with a slight increase towards the end of the period, suggesting calm conditions that would not contribute to any immediate weather changes. The wind direction was predominantly from the west-southwest, which is typical for San Francisco and indicative of the maritime influence on the local climate.
