Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, transitioning from relatively cooler conditions earlier in the day to warmer temperatures by the end of the period. Humidity levels started high but showed a significant decrease later on, which could indicate the presence of a drying trend in the area. Air pressure saw some fluctuation but ultimately increased, suggesting the potential development or strengthening of a high-pressure system over the region. Wind speeds remained mostly light with some variability, while wind direction shifted throughout the day, including a notable shift to a southeasterly direction towards the end of the period, which may bring in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. Overall, the combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and increasing pressure could lead to more stable weather conditions, but the wind direction change could introduce some variability in the local weather pattern.
