Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable decline in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a peak ratio of 8.45% in week 1 dropping to a low of 0.48% by week 15 before slightly rebounding to 0.87% by week 20. The majority of positive specimens are attributed to Influenza A, which dominates the positive specimen percentages throughout the period, although its incidence has also decreased from 8.39% to 0.81%. Influenza B has remained a very minor component of positive specimens, with percentages consistently below 0.1%, peaking at 0.08% and concluding at 0.06% in the last week. This decline in positivity rate may indicate a waning flu season, potentially leading to a decrease in healthcare system burden related to influenza. However, the recent slight uptick suggests vigilance is still needed as it may signal a possible resurgence or the arrival of a late-season wave.
