Over the last 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable drop in temperature indicating that cooler air has moved into the region. Accompanying this temperature change, there was a significant increase in air pressure, suggesting the arrival of a high-pressure system which is often associated with clearer and calmer weather conditions. Humidity levels experienced a dramatic fluctuation, dropping sharply towards the latter part of the time series, which could have contributed to more comfortable conditions despite the cooler temperatures. Wind speeds remained relatively moderate throughout, but there was a notable shift in wind direction from predominantly southerly to a northerly component, which could be indicative of a frontal passage. Overall, these indicators suggest that Houston's weather has transitioned towards a drier and more stable pattern due to the influence of the high-pressure system.
