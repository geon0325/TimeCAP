Over the past day in Houston, there has been a notable fluctuation in temperature, showing a general cooling trend towards the latter part of the period. Humidity levels experienced a significant peak, reaching saturation at one point, which could indicate the presence of fog or heavy dew during that time. Air pressure varied but showed a tendency to increase, suggesting a potential for stable weather conditions to develop. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate throughout the period, with a few hours of calmer conditions, and the wind direction shifted significantly, indicating the passage of a weather front or a changing weather pattern. These conditions, combined with the high humidity, could have led to the development of localized weather phenomena such as morning fog followed by clearer conditions as the day progressed.
