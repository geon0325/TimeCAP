Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a slight increase in temperature, suggesting a warming trend that could affect comfort levels and energy usage patterns in the area. Humidity levels have shown minor fluctuations but remained relatively high throughout, which may lead to a muggy feeling and could potentially exacerbate certain health conditions. Air pressure has been notably stable, with a slight decrease observed recently, which might indicate the potential for changing weather patterns, including the possibility of precipitation or the onset of a weather front. Wind speeds have been consistent and moderate, which may offer some relief from the humidity but are not strong enough to significantly disperse atmospheric pollutants. The wind direction has been predominantly from the southeast, maintaining a consistent pattern, which is typical for Houston's climate and suggests a steady flow of air from the Gulf of Mexico.
