Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a significant increase in both the number of respiratory specimens tested for influenza and the number of positive cases, with a noticeable peak in the ratio of positive specimens at 27.37% in week 17, followed by a slight decrease. The data shows a higher prevalence of Influenza A than Influenza B; however, the growth in positive cases for Influenza B has been steeper, with the ratio of positive specimens for Influenza B increasing from 0.72% to 10.95%, compared to Influenza A which increased from 1.48% to 15.17%. The overall positive specimen ratio grew from 2.20% to 26.12%, suggesting a widespread influenza outbreak. The peak testing period coincided with a substantial rise in positive Influenza A and B cases, indicating a potential strain on healthcare resources due to increased patient load. The trends suggest a need for heightened public health measures, increased vaccination efforts, and preparedness in healthcare settings to manage the rising cases of influenza.
