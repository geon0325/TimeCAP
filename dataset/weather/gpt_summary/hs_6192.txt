Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable diurnal cycle in temperature with values peaking in the late afternoon and reaching their lowest just before dawn. Humidity levels have shown an inverse relationship with temperature, increasing overnight and decreasing during the day, which is typical for this region. Air pressure has remained fairly stable with a slight decrease observed, possibly indicating a weak weather system moving through the area. Wind speeds have been generally light with some variability, and while predominantly coming from the south-southeast, there have been shifts to a more westerly direction at times. The wind direction variability, along with the observed changes in air pressure, could suggest the presence of passing weather fronts or local convective activity affecting Houston's weather.
