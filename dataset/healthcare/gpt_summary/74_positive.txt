Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable overall decrease in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a peak positivity rate of 19.71% in week 3 and a significantly lower rate of 1.84% by week 20. Influenza A showed a declining trend from a high of 12.04% to 1.21%, while Influenza B also decreased from 10.56% to 0.63% over the same period. The decline in positive specimens for both types of influenza suggests a waning phase of the influenza season or effective public health interventions. The notable drop in positivity rates could lead to a reduction in the burden on healthcare resources, including hospital admissions and use of antiviral medications. However, continued surveillance is essential to monitor for potential resurgences or new strains that could impact the current trend.
