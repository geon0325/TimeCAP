Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a noticeable decline in temperature during the early morning hours followed by a consistent rise reaching its peak in the late afternoon, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuation, with notably higher values during the cooler morning period, suggesting the potential for morning fog or dew, and lower values in the afternoon, which is common as temperatures rise. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor variations, indicating steady weather conditions without the presence of significant frontal systems. Wind speeds varied modestly throughout the day, with a period of calm winds around midday, and generally increased towards the evening, which could lead to cooler nighttime conditions if the trend persists. The wind direction was predominantly from the south to the southeast, which in Houston is often associated with warmer and more humid air coming from the Gulf of Mexico, contributing to the overall mugginess felt during the day.
