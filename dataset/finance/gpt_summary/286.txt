Over the past 20 market days, the S&P 500 has exhibited significant volatility, with a notable downward trend, dropping from 3337.75 to 2409.39, indicating a bearish market sentiment. Concurrently, the VIX, or fear index, has seen a dramatic increase from 17.08 to 72.00, reflecting heightened market uncertainty and risk aversion among investors. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have mirrored this decline, with the Nikkei falling from 23386.74 to 16552.83 and the FTSE 100 from 7403.90 to 5151.60, suggesting a global market downturn. Commodity prices have also been affected, with Gold Futures experiencing fluctuations but ending slightly lower at 1478.60 from 1644.60, while Crude Oil Futures plummeted from 53.38 to 25.22, indicating a severe contraction in demand. Exchange rates have seen the USD strengthening against the JPY but weakening against the CNY, and remaining relatively stable against the EUR, which may signal a flight to liquidity and safety in currency markets.
