Over the last 20 weeks, the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data indicates a consistent decline in both the total number of patients presenting with ILI symptoms across all age groups and the ratio of ILI patients as a percentage of total patient visits. The ILI ratio has steadily decreased from 2.59% to 1.29%, remaining below the 2.9% benchmark that signifies a more severe influenza situation. The age group 0-4 years consistently reported the highest number of ILI cases, but like other age groups, showed a downward trend, suggesting a reduction in ILI spread or severity. The most significant decrease in ILI percentages is observed in the 5-24 years age group, which could imply effective containment or reduced transmission among school-aged and young adults. The declining trend across all age demographics implies a currently less strained healthcare system in terms of ILI, but continued surveillance is necessary to monitor for any changes that could signal a resurgence.
