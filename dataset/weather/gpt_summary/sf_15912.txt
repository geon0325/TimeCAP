Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a noticeable fluctuation in temperature, with the warmth peaking in the late afternoon before gradually cooling towards the early hours of the morning. Humidity levels remained fairly constant, with a slight dip occurring during the afternoon hours, likely in response to the increase in temperature. Air pressure showed a general increasing trend throughout the day, with a significant spike in the latest hour, which could potentially lead to changes in weather patterns, such as clearer skies or the development of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were mostly gentle to moderate and showed no extreme variations, while the wind direction was predominantly from the west-northwest, with occasional shifts towards the north and northwest. These consistent wind patterns, along with the current air pressure rise, suggest stable weather conditions may persist in the short term.
