Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures exhibited a typical diurnal pattern with a peak during the afternoon hours and a cooling trend into the night, leading into a gradual warming trend towards the following afternoon. Humidity levels remained relatively high throughout the period, suggesting a presence of moisture in the air which could contribute to the feeling of mugginess or potential for fog, especially during the cooler early morning hours. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight decrease noted towards the end of the period, which could indicate an approaching weather system.
