Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a gradual decrease in temperature which eventually rose again, suggesting a typical diurnal pattern with cooler conditions at night and warming during the day. Humidity levels were consistently high, indicating a significant amount of moisture in the air, but a sharp drop was observed, which could relate to a change in weather conditions such as the passage of a frontal boundary. Air pressure has been slowly decreasing, which is often associated with the approach of a low-pressure system that can lead to unsettled weather. Wind speeds remained light and variable, which is typical for the region and does not suggest any immediate severe weather conditions. Wind direction varied but predominantly came from the west and the north, which are common directions for coastal San Francisco and could influence the temperature and fog conditions in the area.
