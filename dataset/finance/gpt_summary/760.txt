Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with a notable downward trend, having decreased from 4696.05 to 4477.44, which might suggest a weakening investor confidence. The VIX, commonly referred to as the "fear index," corroborates this market anxiety, with an uptick from 19.61 to 24.35, indicating increased market volatility and risk aversion. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 also experienced fluctuations, but the FTSE 100 ended on a slightly positive note from its starting point, potentially reflecting stronger resilience or regional market dynamics. Gold Futures prices have remained relatively stable with a slight decline, suggesting that investors are not rushing to safety in gold, while Crude Oil Futures have increased from 79.46 to 90.27, potentially indicating supply concerns or expectations of rising demand. Lastly, the currency exchange rates show the Euro and the Japanese Yen weakening against the U.S. Dollar, while the Chinese Yuan remained stable, suggesting diverging economic outlooks or policy responses among major economies.
