Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a variable but generally increasing trend in the number of specimens tested for influenza, peaking in week 14 with 42,526 tests. Despite fluctuations, the ratio of positive specimens has remained below the 20-week average of 6.26%, peaking at 0.40% in week 3, indicating a relatively low prevalence of influenza in the tested population. Influenza B has consistently shown a higher positivity rate than Influenza A, with its peak at 0.22% in week 3 and a notable spike in week 19 at 0.21%, suggesting a possible late-season surge. The highest combined positivity rate for both strains occurred in week 3, which could have indicated a potential early season peak, but subsequent rates did not sustain this upward trend. The overall low positivity rates indicate that influenza has not been widespread during this period, which could imply less strain on healthcare resources for influenza; however, the late-season uptick in Influenza B cases warrants continued surveillance.
