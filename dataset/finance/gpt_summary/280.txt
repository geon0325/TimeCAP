Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has exhibited volatility with a significant drop from 3386.15 to 2741.38, indicative of market uncertainties and potential investor caution. The VIX, or Volatility Index, has seen a marked increase from 13.74 to 53.90, reinforcing the heightened market volatility and investor fear. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have mirrored this downtrend, with the Nikkei dropping from 23861.21 to 19416.06 and the FTSE 100 from 7534.40 to 5876.50, suggesting a global impact. Gold Futures initially spiked from 1567.40 to 1674.50, reflecting its status as a safe-haven asset during market turmoil, but retracted slightly to 1641.40, indicating a consolidation phase. Exchange rates have seen the Euro and Japanese Yen appreciate against the USD, moving from 1.09 to 1.13 and 109.84 to 105.03 respectively, while the USD/CNY has remained relatively stable with a slight depreciation of the USD, which could point to a flight to perceived safer currencies and a rebalancing of currency values due to changing market dynamics.
