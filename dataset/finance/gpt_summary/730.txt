Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with a general downtrend, starting at 4690.70 and ending at 4649.23, indicating potential investor caution. The VIX, which measures market volatility, peaked at 28.62 and ended at 21.01, reflecting the fluctuations in the S&P 500 and suggesting a period of increased market uncertainty. International markets have also experienced instability, with the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 both showing declines, although the FTSE 100 had a slight recovery in the latter days. Gold futures have remained relatively stable, with minor fluctuations indicating its role as a potential safe-haven asset during this period of market turbulence. Crude oil futures plummeted to a low of 65.57 before recovering to 71.12, and the stability in major currency pairs EUR/USD and USD/JPY suggests that currency markets have not reacted as sharply to these equity and commodity movements.
