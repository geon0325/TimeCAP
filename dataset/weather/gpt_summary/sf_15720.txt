Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have fluctuated, indicating a typical diurnal pattern with a rise during the daytime and a drop at night, remaining within a comfortable range. Humidity levels have shown slight variability but generally remained high, which could lead to a feeling of mugginess and potential fog development, especially during the cooler early morning and late evening hours. Air pressure has been relatively stable, suggesting steady weather conditions without significant short-term changes in the weather pattern. Wind speeds have varied with a period of calm winds followed by an increase towards the current hour, which could disperse any fog or low-lying clouds, contributing to clearer skies. Lastly, wind direction has been predominantly from the west and southwest, which is typical for San Francisco's maritime climate and may bring in cooler ocean air, affecting local temperatures and fog presence.
