Over the past day in Houston, temperatures have shown a gradual warming trend, particularly in the afternoon hours, which is typical due to increased solar heating. Humidity levels have decreased as temperatures rose, suggesting that the air has become drier, which could contribute to increased comfort levels despite the higher temperatures. Air pressure has shown a slight decreasing trend, which could indicate the approach of a weather system that may bring changes in the near future. Wind speeds have been generally low, with occasional calm conditions, and the wind direction has varied, showing no dominant pattern, which is common in a region without strong pressure gradients. Overall, the weather in Houston has been relatively stable, but the slight drop in pressure could signal a change in the coming days.
