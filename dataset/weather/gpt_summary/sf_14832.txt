Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have exhibited a cooling trend during the early hours, reaching a minimum before gradually warming up towards the latter part of the time series. Humidity levels started relatively low but increased significantly, reaching saturation at one point, which could have been associated with fog or mist, especially during the cooler early morning hours. Air pressure experienced fluctuations but showed a general increasing trend, which could indicate the approach or presence of a high-pressure system, potentially leading to more stable weather conditions. Wind speeds were mostly light to gentle but increased to moderate levels during the day, which could enhance the feeling of cooler temperatures, particularly when combined with higher wind speeds. Wind direction varied but predominantly came from the south-west to the west, which is typical for coastal San Francisco and could bring in marine air influencing local weather patterns.
