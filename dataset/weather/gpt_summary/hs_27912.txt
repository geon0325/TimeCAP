Over the last 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual increase in temperature during the day with a peak in the late afternoon before cooling down towards the evening. Humidity levels were notably high throughout, reaching saturation at several points, which could indicate the presence of fog or mist, especially during the early hours when temperatures were lower. Air pressure varied slightly but showed a significant rise in the late evening, suggesting a potential shift in weather patterns or the movement of a high-pressure system into the area. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate and predominantly came from southerly directions, shifting more westerly as the day progressed. The combination of high humidity, increasing temperatures, and varying air pressure could lead to the development of unsettled weather, including the possibility of thunderstorms or rain showers.
