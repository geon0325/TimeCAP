Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before starting to decline towards the evening. Humidity levels were high throughout the day, with a notable spike to saturation at one point, which could have increased the likelihood of fog or precipitation. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight increase midday, suggesting steady weather conditions. Wind speeds varied moderately, with no significant gusts, while the predominant wind direction was from the south-southeast, which is typical for Houston's climate and could contribute to the moisture levels observed. The combination of these factors indicates a warm and humid day with stable atmospheric conditions, typical of Houston's subtropical environment.
