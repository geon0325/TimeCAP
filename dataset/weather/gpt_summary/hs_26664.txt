Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual decline in temperature during the early hours, followed by a significant increase as the day progressed, which is typical of the diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels showed considerable fluctuation, reaching their peak during the coldest part of the early hours, indicative of possible morning fog or dew, then plummeting to much lower levels as temperatures rose, which could have led to drier conditions later in the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight increase towards the end of the period, suggesting stable weather conditions may persist. Wind speeds varied modestly, with a noticeable increase around midday that could have contributed to the dispersal of any early humidity or cloud cover. Wind direction was predominantly from the east to east-northeast, which is common for Houston and may have contributed to the transport of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico during periods of higher humidity.
