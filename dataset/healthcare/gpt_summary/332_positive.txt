Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a peak ratio of 9.89% in week 9, followed by a declining trend to the current low of 1.27% in week 20. The majority of positive specimens were for Influenza A, which showed a similar trend with a peak at 9.85% and a subsequent decrease to 1.21%. Influenza B has remained a minor contributor to the overall influenza positivity rate, with the ratio of positive specimens for Influenza B consistently staying below 0.17% throughout the 20-week period. This declining trend in positive influenza specimens, particularly the sharp drop after week 9, suggests a waning influenza season, which could potentially alleviate some pressure on healthcare resources. However, healthcare systems must remain vigilant for possible new outbreaks and continue promoting influenza vaccination as a key preventive measure.
