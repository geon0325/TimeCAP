Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have exhibited a slight warming trend, increasing from cooler conditions to moderate warmth. Humidity levels fluctuated moderately but remained generally high, suggesting a presence of moisture in the air that could lead to a feeling of mugginess or the potential for fog, especially during the early hours. Air pressure remained relatively stable, indicating steady weather conditions without the immediate likelihood of significant weather disruptions. Wind speeds varied from calm to light breezes, with some variability in direction, including instances of northerly and southerly winds, which are typical for coastal cities like San Francisco and can affect coastal fog and temperature distribution. The combination of these factors suggests a stable weather pattern, with the potential for cooler and possibly foggy conditions in the mornings, giving way to clearer and milder conditions during the day.
