Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable decline in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the ratio of positive specimens dropping from 12.69% to 0.76%. This decline is reflected in both Influenza A and B subtypes, with Influenza A rates decreasing from 4.14% to 0.51% and Influenza B rates from 8.55% to 0.25%. Despite the overall reduction in positivity rates, the percentage of specimens tested for Influenza A and B that were positive remained above the 20-week average of 6.26% for the first five weeks but has since fallen below average, indicating a downward trend in influenza activity. The highest number of specimens tested was 27,339 in week one, decreasing over time to 7,065 in week 20, which may suggest a decreasing demand for influenza testing as the infection rates decline. The observed decrease in influenza cases could potentially alleviate some of the seasonal strain on healthcare resources, but continual monitoring is essential to manage and respond to any future changes in influenza activity.
