Over the past 24 hours in New York City, there has been a notable upward trend in temperature, reaching a peak in the late afternoon before a slight decrease toward the evening. Humidity levels have experienced an overall decrease throughout the day, suggesting a shift toward drier conditions. Atmospheric pressure has been on a gradual decline, which could indicate the approach of a weather system with the potential to bring changes in the near future.
