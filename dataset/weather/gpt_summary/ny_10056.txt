Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, transitioning from below-freezing conditions early in the period to milder temperatures later on. Humidity levels have seen a moderate decrease throughout the day, suggesting drier air moving into the area. Air pressure has been notably stable initially, but there was a significant rise in the middle of the period, which is indicative of a high-pressure system potentially leading to clearer skies and calmer weather conditions. Wind speeds have been mostly gentle but showed a slight increase towards the end of the period. Furthermore, there was a notable shift in wind direction from predominantly westerly to a more northerly and then easterly flow, which could affect temperature and precipitation patterns in the following hours.
