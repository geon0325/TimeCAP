Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility but ended with a moderate net decrease, suggesting a cautious outlook among investors. The VIX, while fluctuating, has trended downwards overall, indicating that market volatility is decreasing, albeit with a spike in the last day that could signal renewed uncertainty. International markets have been similarly unstable, with Japan's Nikkei 225 and the UK's FTSE 100 experiencing fluctuations but generally trending upwards, pointing towards some investor confidence in these regions. Commodity markets have seen remarkable movements, particularly with an unprecedented negative dip in Crude Oil Futures, although prices have somewhat recovered since, and Gold Futures have remained relatively stable with slight increases, reflecting its status as a safe-haven asset. Lastly, the foreign exchange rates have shown the USD weakening against the EUR and JPY but slightly strengthening against the CNY, which may affect international trade dynamics and could indicate shifting investor sentiment towards these currencies.
