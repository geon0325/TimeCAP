Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a noticeable drop in temperature, which then gradually increased, suggesting a cool period followed by a warming trend. Humidity levels peaked at one point, indicating the possibility of fog or mist, particularly during the cooler early hours, but later showed a decrease, which may have led to clearer conditions. Air pressure varied, with a slight increase initially, followed by a decrease, and then a rise again towards the end of the period, which could be associated with changing wind patterns and possibly the movement of a weather front through the area. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with a few instances of calmer conditions, likely contributing to the fluctuation in temperature and humidity. The wind direction was variable, predominantly coming from the north, but with significant shifts to other directions at times, which may have influenced local weather conditions, such as wind chill and dispersal of any fog or mist.
