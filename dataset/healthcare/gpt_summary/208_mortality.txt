Over the past 20 weeks, the data indicates a declining trend in both the absolute number of deaths attributed to influenza or pneumonia and their proportion relative to total deaths. Initially, the mortality ratio from these causes was significantly higher than the average ratio of 7.84%, starting at 19.37% and peaking at 19.40% in the second week, but it has since decreased consistently to a low of 7.43% in the last week. The total number of deaths has fluctuated but shows a slight overall decreasing trend, with initial figures at 86,888 and ending at 58,634 in week 20. The number of deaths from pneumonia has almost halved from 16,800 in week 1 to 4,350 in week 20, while influenza-related deaths have remained low with minor fluctuations, indicating that the majority of the respiratory-related mortality is due to pneumonia. This downward trend could signal a reduction in the incidence or severity of these illnesses or improvements in prevention or treatment methods, which could alleviate some of the burden on healthcare services.
