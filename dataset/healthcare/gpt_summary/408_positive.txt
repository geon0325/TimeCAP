Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant increase in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a marked upward trend from 1.06% to 13.46%. Influenza A has been the predominant subtype throughout this period, with its positive specimen ratio rising sharply from 0.63% to 11.03%, while Influenza B also showed a substantial increase but to a lesser extent, from 0.44% to 2.42%. The highest weekly increase in overall positive specimens occurred in the last observed week, jumping from 8.49% to 13.46%, which suggests a rapid spread of the virus. Given the growth in positive cases, particularly for Influenza A, healthcare systems may face increased demand for medical services, diagnostic testing, and potential strain on healthcare resources. Public health interventions and vaccination campaigns may need to be intensified to mitigate the impact of this rising trend in influenza activity.
