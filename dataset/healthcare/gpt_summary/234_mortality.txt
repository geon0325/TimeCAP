Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable increase in the proportion of deaths attributed to influenza or pneumonia relative to total fatalities, rising from 6.23% to 11.76%, which exceeds the average ratio of 7.84%. This upward trend suggests a significant seasonal impact or a possible outbreak, warranting increased healthcare resources and public health interventions. The total number of deaths peaked around the 5th week at 73,352 before gradually decreasing, yet the absolute numbers for influenza or pneumonia-related deaths continued to rise, indicating a growing burden of these respiratory conditions. Pneumonia, in particular, has shown a marked increase in mortality, from 3,554 to 8,060 deaths over the observed period, reflecting a critical area for healthcare focus. These trends underscore the need for heightened surveillance, vaccination efforts, and treatment strategies to manage and mitigate the impact of respiratory infections on public health.
