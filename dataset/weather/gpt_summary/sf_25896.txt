Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have experienced a gradual increase from the early hours, peaking during the afternoon before slightly declining towards the evening, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels showed a significant fluctuation, with a notable spike towards the late night hours, which could suggest the presence of increased moisture or fog, a common occurrence in the region. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase at one point, which might be associated with transient high-pressure conditions affecting the area. Wind speeds varied, starting stronger and decreasing towards the middle of the day, then slightly picking up again towards the end of the period, which could influence oceanic conditions such as wave heights along the coast. The wind direction was predominantly westerly, with some variability, aligning with the common wind patterns for the city, influenced by both the Pacific Ocean and the local topography.
