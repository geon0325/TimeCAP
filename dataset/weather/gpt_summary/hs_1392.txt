Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have experienced a gradual increase, particularly noticeable during the afternoon hours, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Relative humidity has shown a decreasing trend as temperatures peaked, which is characteristic of the inverse relationship between temperature and humidity. Air pressure remained relatively stable but showed a slight decrease later in the period, which could suggest a minor change in the weather pattern or the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds were mostly light and variable, with a tendency towards calm conditions in the late hours, which could lead to the formation of fog or dew if temperatures drop near the dew point overnight. Notably, the wind direction shifted significantly in the final hours, implying a change in the local weather system that could influence upcoming weather conditions.
