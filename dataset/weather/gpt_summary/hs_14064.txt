Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has exhibited a diurnal pattern, starting off warm in the early hours, cooling slightly, and then rising to very warm conditions by the afternoon. Humidity levels have been high throughout, typical for Houston's subtropical climate, but showed a modest decline during the peak afternoon temperatures, which could increase the discomfort index for residents despite the temperature peak. Air pressure has seen fluctuations, with a notable increase towards the middle of the time frame, which could indicate the transient influence of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds have been generally low, with a few hours of calm conditions, but there were periods of moderate breeze which might have contributed to slight relief from the humidity. Wind direction has been variable, with no dominant pattern, suggesting a lack of a strong weather front influencing the local climate during the observed period.
