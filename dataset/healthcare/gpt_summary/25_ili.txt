Over the last 20 weeks, the incidence of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) has shown an upward trend across all age groups, with a persistent increase in the ratio of ILI patients that has consistently risen above the established baseline. The most significant increases in ILI cases have been observed in the youngest (0-4 years) and school-age (5-24 years) populations, suggesting a higher level of transmission or susceptibility within these demographics. Although there has been a general rise in ILI cases across all age brackets, the elderly population (65 years or older) has shown a relatively smaller increase in the number of ILI cases compared to other age groups. The consistent rise in the ratio of ILI patients indicates a growing burden on the healthcare system, which may necessitate increased healthcare resources, including medical staff, hospital beds, and medications. Given the progressive nature of the observed trend, public health initiatives to control the spread, such as vaccination and public awareness campaigns, may be critical in mitigating the impact on the community and healthcare infrastructure.
