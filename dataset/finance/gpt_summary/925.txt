Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a downward trend, declining from 3924.26 to 3585.62, which indicates a bearish sentiment in the market. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, remained elevated with slight fluctuations, suggesting persistent investor uncertainty. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 also reflected a similar downward tendency, with the Nikkei dropping from 27650.84 to 25937.21 and the FTSE 100 from 7281.20 to 6893.80, indicating a broader global market retreat. Gold futures have experienced volatility but ended slightly lower than the starting point, moving from 1709.80 to 1662.40, which may signal a flight to safety amid market turbulence. The exchange rates have seen the US dollar appreciating against the Japanese Yen and the Chinese Yuan but slightly weakening against the Euro, pointing towards currency market reactions to differing economic conditions across these regions.
