Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a rising trend in the number of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a significant increase in both Influenza A and B strains. In week 1, the ratio of positive specimens was 1.12%, which has continuously escalated to a peak of 23.65% by week 19, before a slight decrease to 19.97% in week 20. The rate of increase for Influenza A has been more pronounced than for Influenza B, as evidenced by the higher peak ratio of positive specimens for Influenza A (18.16%) compared to Influenza B (5.49%) in week 19. Despite the recent small decline, the positive specimen ratios substantially exceed the 20-week average of 6.26%, indicating a potential strain on healthcare resources due to increased influenza activity. This trend suggests the need for heightened surveillance, resource allocation for influenza management, and public health interventions to mitigate the spread of the disease.
