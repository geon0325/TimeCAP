Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperature has experienced moderate fluctuations, with a general cooling trend towards the latter part of the period. Humidity levels remained high throughout the day, often reaching saturation, which could have contributed to foggy conditions, especially when temperature and humidity were both at higher levels. Air pressure saw some variation but stayed within a range typical for stable weather, experiencing a slight increase towards the end of the observed period. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with a few instances of higher speeds, and the wind direction was variable, though predominantly from the southern and westerly quadrants, which is common for coastal regions. This combination of high humidity, moderate temperatures, and varying wind conditions could have led to periods of overcast skies and the potential for morning coastal fog, characteristic of San Francisco's microclimate.
