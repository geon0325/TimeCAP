Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual decline in temperature followed by a significant warming trend later in the day, suggesting a typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels were notably high in the early hours but decreased sharply as temperatures peaked, possibly indicating the presence of a dry air mass moving into the area. Air pressure saw minor fluctuations throughout the period, with a slight overall decrease, which could suggest that the region is experiencing stable to slightly unstable atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds remained relatively light and consistent, with no significant gusts, indicating a calm wind regime. The wind direction varied, predominantly coming from the west and southwest, which is typical for coastal San Francisco, potentially bringing in marine air and affecting local temperatures and humidity.
