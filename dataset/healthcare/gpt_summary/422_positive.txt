Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the rate of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the ratio of positive specimens peaking at 18.27% in week eight and then gradually declining to 10.39% by week twenty. Influenza A has consistently been the predominant strain, reaching its highest positivity rate of 14.99% in week eight before decreasing to 5.28% by the end of the period, indicating a subsiding wave of infections. In contrast, Influenza B showed a slower increase but maintained a relatively high positivity rate, peaking at 6.93% in week sixteen and then slightly declining to 5.11% by week twenty, suggesting a persistent presence in the population. The overall decline in positivity rates for both strains towards the end of the 20-week period may indicate a tapering off of the influenza season, yet the sustained rates of infection highlight the need for continued surveillance and potential resource allocation in the healthcare system. These trends are critical for healthcare providers and policymakers to manage ongoing patient care and to prepare for possible future surges in influenza cases.
