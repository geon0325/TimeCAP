Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a notable diurnal temperature variation with a gradual increase during the day and a decrease at night, typical of the region's coastal climate. Humidity levels were relatively high throughout the period, peaking during the early hours, which could have contributed to a perception of cooler temperatures and potential morning fog, a common occurrence in the area. Atmospheric pressure remained fairly stable, indicating a period without significant weather fronts moving through the region, which is often associated with calm weather patterns. Wind speeds were consistently light, suggesting a tranquil weather scene with limited wind-related impacts. Wind direction varied but predominantly came from a westerly direction, which is characteristic of the prevailing winds influenced by the Pacific Ocean's maritime airflow in San Francisco.
