Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before slightly declining toward the evening. Despite the rising temperatures, humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, with periods of very high humidity, particularly during the cooler early morning hours when temperatures were at their lowest. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight increasing trend through the midday hours, indicating steady weather conditions. Wind speeds were mostly light to gentle, with some variability in the direction, but there was a notable increase in wind speed in the final hours of the period. The combination of rising temperatures, varying humidity, and stable pressure, along with the light winds, suggest a typical warm and potentially muggy day for Houston, with calm weather conditions likely to persist.
