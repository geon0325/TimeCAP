Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before slightly cooling down. Humidity levels showed variations, starting high, then decreasing significantly during the day, and rising again towards the evening, suggesting the presence of moisture that could lead to foggy conditions, especially during the early hours. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight fluctuation; however, a notable drop occurred in the late afternoon, which could be associated with the arrival of a transient weather system. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate throughout the day, with a significant increase in the evening, indicating that conditions could become breezier at night. The wind direction was predominantly from the west to the northwest, which is typical for San Francisco's climate and could contribute to the advection of oceanic air into the city.
