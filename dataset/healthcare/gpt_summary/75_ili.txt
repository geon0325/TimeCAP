Over the last 20 weeks, the ratio of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) patients has gradually increased, surpassing the baseline of 2.9% and demonstrating a consistent upward trend, signaling a rise in ILI cases across all age groups. The most significant increase is observed in the youngest (0-4 years) and school-age (5-24 years) cohorts, suggesting higher transmission rates or susceptibility among these populations. Although the increase in ILI ratios is less pronounced in older age groups, there is still a notable rise in the number of affected individuals aged 50 and above. The healthcare system may expect a continued strain with an increasing need for medical resources and potential implications for the workforce, especially if the trend persists or intensifies. Public health messaging and interventions might need to be tailored to address the higher incidence in children and young adults, while monitoring for any signs of spread to more vulnerable older populations.
