Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperature has experienced a normal diurnal cycle with a gradual decrease during the early hours, reaching its lowest point just before sunrise, followed by a steady increase as the day progressed. Humidity levels have been relatively high, particularly during the night and early morning hours, which is consistent with the cooler temperatures and could lead to a feeling of dampness or the presence of morning fog, a common occurrence in the region. Air pressure has remained stable, indicating a period of settled weather without significant changes or the development of any major weather systems. Wind speeds have been mostly light, with a slight increase in the latter part of the period, which could contribute to minor variations in temperature and humidity through increased mixing of air. The wind direction has been predominantly from the south to the southwest, which is typical for coastal California and suggests the continuation of the current weather pattern.
