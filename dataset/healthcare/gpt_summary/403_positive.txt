Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable upward trend in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the total ratio of positive specimens increasing from 1.10% to 3.96%. This trend is particularly pronounced for Influenza A, which saw its positivity rate grow from 0.73% to 2.80%, suggesting a significant surge in this subtype. Influenza B also shows an increase, though less steep, with its ratio rising from 0.38% to 1.16%. The total number of specimens tested has escalated, peaking at 92,301 in the last week, indicating a possible increase in respiratory illness and testing demand. These trends suggest a growing influenza activity which could strain healthcare resources and necessitate increased influenza surveillance and possibly vaccination efforts.
