Over the past 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with a general downward trend, closing with a loss of 4% from the initial value of 2939.88 to 2822.24. The VIX, which measures market volatility, has correspondingly increased by 32.8% suggesting heightened investor uncertainty. International markets such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have also experienced declines of 4.8% and 2.7%, respectively, indicating a global sentiment of caution in equity markets. Gold futures, typically a safe-haven asset, saw a slight increase of 0.02%, hinting at investors seeking stability amid market turbulence. Commodity markets reflected concerns as well, with Crude Oil Futures experiencing a significant drop of 8.5%, while currency exchange rates remained relatively stable, with minor fluctuations in the EUR/USD, USD/JPY, and USD/CNY pairs, suggesting that currency markets are not reacting as strongly to the current equity and commodity market volatility.
