The VIX, which measures market volatility, has fluctuated but remained elevated, ending slightly lower at 22.70 compared to its starting point, suggesting that investors expect continued market volatility. International markets have been mixed, with Japan's Nikkei 225 showing resilience with a rise from 26827.43 to 27172.00, while the FTSE 100 displayed steady performance, closing modestly higher. Gold futures have seen an uptrend from 1928.20 to 1970.90, typically a sign of investor risk aversion, while Crude Oil futures have been highly volatile, yet ended higher, moving from 104.70 to 106.95, which could indicate concerns over supply constraints or geopolitical tensions. Exchange rates have seen the EUR/USD weakening and the USD strengthening against both the JPY and CNY, suggesting a flight to the perceived safety of the dollar amidst global financial uncertainty.
