Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature which later stabilized and slightly increased, indicating a typical diurnal temperature variation with cooler conditions overnight and warmer temperatures during the day. Relative humidity levels fluctuated, peaking during the early hours which is common as temperatures drop, before decreasing and then rising again, suggesting a presence of moisture that could lead to fog or low-level clouds, especially during the morning or late evening. Air pressure showed an overall increasing trend, which typically correlates with stable weather conditions and a lower likelihood of precipitation. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate and variable in direction, with occasional shifts indicating changing weather patterns or the influence of local topography on wind flow. The predominant wind direction was southerly, shifting to westerly and then northerly, which may influence coastal fog development and the movement of marine air inland.
