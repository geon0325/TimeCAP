Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a general decline in both the total number of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza and the percentage of positive specimens, with a slight increase in the most recent weeks. The ratio of specimens testing positive for influenza A has decreased from a high of 1.73% to a low of 0.82%, before slightly increasing to 1.23% in the latest data. Influenza B specimens have also seen a reduction in positivity rate from 5.03% to 0.45%, with a small recent uptick to 0.66%. The overall positivity rate for influenza has dropped from an initial 6.77% to a low of 1.34%, and has modestly risen to 1.89% in the latest week. This trend suggests a tapering off of the influenza season, but the recent increases may indicate a need for continued surveillance and readiness in the healthcare system for potential upticks in influenza cases.
