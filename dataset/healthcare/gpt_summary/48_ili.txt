The analysis of the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data over the last 20 weeks indicates a fluctuating but overall increasing trend in the percentage of ILI patients relative to the total number of patients, peaking mid-period before gradually declining towards the end of the observed timeframe. Age group data reveals that the highest incidence of ILI consistently occurred in the 5-24 age group, followed by a significantly lower but rising trend in the 25-49 age group, suggesting that younger populations were more affected. There was a notable escalation in ILI percentages that crossed the baseline threshold, reaching its zenith in the latter half of the observed weeks, indicating a period of heightened ILI activity that could strain healthcare resources. The following decrease in ILI percentages across all age groups towards the end of the period may suggest a waning phase of the ILI season or the effectiveness of public health interventions. However, the healthcare system should remain vigilant and prepared for potential fluctuations, given the observed variability in ILI rates and the potential for subsequent increases.
