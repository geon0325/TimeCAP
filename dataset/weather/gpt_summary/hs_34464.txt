Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature before a notable increase during the latter part of the day, suggesting a typical diurnal pattern with a warm afternoon peak. Concurrently, humidity levels were high, even reaching saturation at one point, indicative of a very moist air mass that could have led to foggy conditions or precipitation. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight increase towards the afternoon, which is generally associated with fair weather conditions. Wind speeds varied but showed an increase in the evening, possibly bringing changes to the weather pattern or providing relief from the high humidity. The wind direction shifted significantly throughout the day, with notable changes from southerly to northerly and then easterly directions, which could influence temperature and moisture transport in the region.
