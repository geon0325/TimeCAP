Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable decline in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the ratio of positive specimens decreasing from a high of 24.73% to 2.18%. Influenza A has shown a consistent downward trend in positivity rates, dropping from 18.49% to 1.06%, which suggests a significant reduction in its prevalence among the tested specimens. In contrast, Influenza B exhibited a peaked pattern, with an initial increase to 10.56% positivity followed by a decrease to 1.12%, indicating a different seasonal pattern or response to public health interventions. The overall decrease in positive specimens for both Influenza A and B could point towards the end of the flu season or the effectiveness of current control measures such as vaccination or natural immunity. However, the healthcare system should remain vigilant for potential case spikes and maintain resources for testing and treatment, considering the historical patterns of influenza and the possibility of future fluctuations.
