Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the ratio of mortality due to influenza or pneumonia when compared to total deaths, starting at 6.59% and peaking at 16.83% before decreasing to 8.65% in the most recent week. This peak represents more than double the 20-week average ratio of 7.84%, indicating a significant increase in influenza or pneumonia-related mortality during the period. The absolute number of deaths attributed to pneumonia has shown an upward trend, reaching its zenith in week 14, with a subsequent decline, while influenza mortality remained relatively low with a slight increase toward the end of the period. The highest ratios of influenza or pneumonia mortality to total deaths coincide with the peak weeks for total mortality (weeks 10 through 14), suggesting a potential seasonal pattern or outbreak. These trends highlight an increased burden on the healthcare system during these peak times and underscore the importance of continued monitoring and preparedness for respiratory illnesses.
