Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a notable increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before gradually decreasing towards the evening. Humidity levels showed a significant decrease during the afternoon hours, likely due to the rising temperatures, and then spiked during the evening, potentially indicating the development of evening moisture. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight increase throughout the day, suggesting stable weather conditions. Wind speeds varied, with calmer conditions around dawn and increased wind activity during the afternoon and into the night, while the wind direction was predominantly from the south to southeast, except for a brief period in the evening when it shifted to a northwesterly direction. These conditions suggest a typical warm and humid day in Houston transitioning into a slightly cooler and more stable evening, with wind patterns supporting the movement of heat and moisture throughout the area.
