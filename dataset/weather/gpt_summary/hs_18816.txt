Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have shown a diurnal cycle starting at moderately cool levels in the early hours, with a gradual warming trend peaking in the late afternoon, before cooling again towards the evening. Humidity levels have fluctuated within a moderate range, suggesting variable atmospheric moisture that could influence the comfort levels of residents. Air pressure has remained relatively high and stable, increasing slightly throughout the period, which is typically associated with settled weather conditions and less likelihood of precipitation. Wind speeds have been light and predominantly stable, which may have contributed to a sense of calm weather but also the potential for slow dispersal of any air pollutants. Wind directions have varied slightly but have shown a shift towards the northwest and then a notable deviation to the southwest in the later hours, which could affect local temperature patterns and possibly bring changes in air mass.
