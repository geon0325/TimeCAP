Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before slightly declining towards the evening. Humidity levels were significantly high during the early hours, indicating potential fog or mist, but showed a decreasing trend throughout the day, suggesting clearer conditions as the day progressed. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight fluctuation; however, it did decrease marginally in the late afternoon, which could be indicative of a minor weather system moving through the area. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate but increased noticeably towards the evening, with the wind direction predominantly coming from the west. The combination of falling humidity, steady air pressure, and increased wind speed towards the evening might suggest a transition to cooler and drier conditions moving forward.
