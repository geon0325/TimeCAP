Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, which started at a cooler point in the early morning and reached its peak in the late afternoon, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels have shown a steady decline throughout the day, which, when coupled with increasing temperatures, suggests drier conditions moving into the area. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight decreasing trend, which could indicate a weak system affecting the area but is unlikely to cause significant weather changes. Wind speeds were moderate and showed some variability, with the highest speeds occurring during the night and early morning hours. The wind direction was predominantly from the north, shifting slightly throughout the day, which is consistent with the passage of a frontal system that could be responsible for the observed changes in temperature and humidity.
