Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 exhibited volatility with a general downward trend, culminating in a significant drop on the last day, suggesting increased bearish sentiment among investors. The VIX, or Volatility Index, correspondingly fluctuated and ended considerably higher, indicating heightened market uncertainty and potential fear in the marketplace. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 both showed relatively less volatility but ended with a slight decline, reflecting cautiousness in global equity markets. Gold Futures prices remained relatively stable with slight fluctuations, suggesting it is being used as a hedge against market volatility. Crude Oil Futures experienced a downward trend, ending lower, which could signal concerns about global economic prospects, while currency exchange rates for EUR/USD remained fairly stable, and USD/JPY and USD/CNY saw minor fluctuations reflecting a stable currency market in the face of equity volatility.
