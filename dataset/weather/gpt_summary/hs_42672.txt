Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have exhibited a typical diurnal pattern, with the peak during the late afternoon and a gradual cooling trend overnight into the early morning, before rising again. Humidity levels have shown an inverse relationship with temperature, increasing as the temperature dropped and decreasing as it rose, indicating a potential for early morning dew and more comfortable conditions as the day warmed. Air pressure has remained relatively stable with only minor fluctuations, suggesting a period of steady weather without significant frontal activity. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with occasional gusts, and the prevailing winds shifted from southeasterly to southwesterly, which is typical for this region and may contribute to the transport of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. Overall, the weather in Houston has been stable with no extreme changes, characterized by warm temperatures, moderate humidity, and gentle breezes.
