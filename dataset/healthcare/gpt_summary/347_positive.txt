Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable increase in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the overall positivity rate growing from 4.90% to 3.46%. The data reveals that Influenza A is the predominant strain, with its positivity rate rising sharply from 4.84% to 3.36%, suggesting an upward trend in Influenza A activity. In contrast, Influenza B has remained a minor contributor to the total positive cases, with its positivity rate fluctuating minimally around 0.05% to 0.10%. The peak in the total number of specimens tested occurred in the most recent week at 88,055, coinciding with the highest recorded number of positive cases for Influenza A and a positivity percentage increase, indicating a potential surge in influenza transmission. Healthcare systems should prepare for an uptick in influenza cases, focusing on prevention strategies and ensuring adequate resources are available for testing, vaccination, and treatment, especially for vulnerable populations.
