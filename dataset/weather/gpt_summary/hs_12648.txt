Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, reaching its lowest point before dawn and then rising steadily throughout the day. Despite fluctuations, humidity levels generally remained low, although they peaked in the early morning hours, which may have caused a brief period of heavier air and potential for fog formation. Air pressure was relatively high and stable, indicating settled weather conditions and a low likelihood of precipitation. Wind speeds varied but were mostly moderate, with calmer conditions around midnight; however, towards the end of the period, there was a slight uptick in wind speed. Wind direction shifted from predominantly northerly to easterly and then more southeasterly, suggesting a change in weather patterns that could affect future temperatures and humidity levels in the region.
