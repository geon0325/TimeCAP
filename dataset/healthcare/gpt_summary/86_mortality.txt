Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to total deaths has demonstrated an upward trend, increasing from 5.21% to 7.39%, which is notably below the 20-week average of 7.84%. The number of deaths attributed to influenza has seen a significant rise in the latter weeks, especially from week 15 onwards, with deaths jumping from 118 to 671 in week 18, before dropping to 259 in week 20. In contrast, deaths from pneumonia have shown a more gradual increase, reaching a peak in week 18 with 4418 deaths. The spike in the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia in week 18 at 8.33% coincides with the highest recorded deaths from both influenza and pneumonia, suggesting a possible outbreak or increased virulence during that period. This trend warrants close monitoring and may require increased healthcare resources and preventative measures to manage the rising impact of these respiratory diseases on public health.
