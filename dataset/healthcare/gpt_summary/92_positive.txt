Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable upward trend in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the overall positivity ratio rising from 2.16% to 7.09%. The data indicates a more significant increase in Influenza A detections, which have surged from 1.24% to 5.61%, compared to Influenza B, which rose from 0.92% to 1.48%. The highest weekly increase in positive specimens occurred in the most recent week, with Influenza A positives nearly doubling from 3.95% to 5.61% and Influenza B increasing from 1.35% to 1.48%. This trend is concurrent with an increase in the number of specimens tested, peaking at 23,830 in the last week, suggesting a growing prevalence and potential escalation of influenza activity. The increasing rate of influenza positivity, particularly for Influenza A, may indicate a coming or current healthcare challenge, necessitating resource allocation for influenza management and potential vaccination drives.
