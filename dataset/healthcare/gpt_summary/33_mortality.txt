Over the last 20 weeks, the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia to total deaths has shown an increasing trend, starting at 5.58% and rising significantly to 9.56%. This final value substantially exceeds the average ratio of 7.84%. The surge in the last week is particularly notable, with deaths attributed to influenza increasing from 157 to 1165, which coincides with a marked spike in total deaths from 57655 to 66134. Pneumonia-related deaths have also followed an upward trajectory, culminating in a peak of 5156 in the final week. This trend may indicate a potential healthcare strain, necessitating increased resources to manage respiratory illnesses, and could also reflect a seasonal pattern or an emergent outbreak requiring further investigation.
