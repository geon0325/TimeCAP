Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have exhibited a typical diurnal pattern, with the highest values occurring in the afternoon and the lowest just before dawn, indicating a warm day followed by a relatively milder night. Humidity levels peaked during the early hours, suggesting the presence of morning fog or dew, but decreased significantly as temperatures rose, which is common in regions where daytime heating leads to atmospheric instability and moisture dispersion. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively steady, with only slight fluctuations that are within the normal range, indicating stable weather conditions without the immediate presence of significant weather fronts. Wind speeds were generally light, with a slight increase during the night that could have contributed to a minor cooling effect. Wind direction varied but predominantly came from the east and northeast, which in Houston is often associated with moist air from the Gulf of Mexico, potentially contributing to the observed high humidity levels in the morning.
