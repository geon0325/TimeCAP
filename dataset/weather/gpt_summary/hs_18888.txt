Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable increase in temperature, moving from cooler conditions in the early hours to significantly warmer temperatures by the late afternoon. Humidity levels have varied but showed a general decrease during the warmest part of the day, which is typical as higher temperatures often correspond to lower relative humidity. Air pressure has been on a gradual decline throughout the period, suggesting the possibility of an approaching weather system that could lead to changing weather conditions. Wind speeds have been relatively light but increased slightly towards the end of the period, which could contribute to a more noticeable wind chill factor as the evening approaches. The wind direction has been predominantly from the southeast to the south, which is common for Houston and could be bringing in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, potentially affecting local weather patterns.
