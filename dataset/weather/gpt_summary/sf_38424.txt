Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced relatively stable temperature conditions with a slight warming trend observed in the most recent readings. Humidity levels have remained exceptionally high throughout the period, consistently at or near saturation, which may have led to foggy conditions and potentially impacted visibility. Air pressure showed a gradual increase for a significant portion of the time, indicating a building high-pressure system, but this trend reversed slightly in the latest observations. Wind speeds varied, with a general increase toward the current hour, suggesting that breezier conditions have developed. The wind direction was predominantly from the west-northwest, but it shifted to coming from the south-southeast for a brief period, which is typical for coastal cities like San Francisco where wind patterns can change due to local maritime influences.
