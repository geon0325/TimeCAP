Over the last 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have experienced a noticeable fluctuation, with a general trend of cooling overnight followed by a significant increase during daylight hours. Humidity levels showed a peak coinciding with the cooler temperatures, suggesting possible early morning fog or mist, but decreased as temperatures rose. Air pressure readings varied notably, indicating the passage of a weather front and possibly leading to changing weather patterns such as clear skies or windy conditions. Wind speeds were calm at first but picked up later, with the direction shifting predominantly to westerly, which is typical for coastal cities like San Francisco and may bring in marine air.
