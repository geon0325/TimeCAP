Humidity levels have shown a similar pattern with higher values during the cooler early hours, indicating the presence of more moisture in the air, and a decrease as temperatures rose. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with a slight increase towards the middle of the day, which could suggest a brief period of more stable weather conditions. Wind speeds varied, with higher speeds earlier in the period decreasing towards the middle of the day, and then increasing again later on, which could have an impact on the dispersal of any fog or low-lying clouds in the area.
