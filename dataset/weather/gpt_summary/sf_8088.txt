Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperature exhibited a gradual increase, reaching its peak in the later hours before slightly receding. Humidity levels showed significant variation, with a notable dip during the warmest part of the day but generally high values during the cooler night and early morning hours, indicative of a moist air mass over the city. Air pressure decreased considerably throughout the day, which may suggest an approaching weather system that could lead to changing weather conditions. Wind speeds were mostly light and variable, with no significant gusts, indicating a relatively calm wind pattern. The wind direction was predominantly westerly, with some shifts, which is typical for the coastal climate of San Francisco and can contribute to the advection of marine air inland.
