Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a fluctuating yet overall increasing trend in the incidence of Influenza-like Illness (ILI), with a notable rise in the ratio of ILI patients, which recently surpassed the baseline of 2.9%. The age group 0-4 has consistently shown an increase in ILI cases, suggesting a higher vulnerability or exposure among young children. Notably, the age group 5-24 has experienced a significant spike in ILI cases in the most recent week, which may be attributed to factors such as school attendance and social interactions. Although the age groups 25-49, 50-64, and 65 or more have also seen an upward trend, their ratios have been slightly more stable than those of the younger age groups. The crossing of the ILI baseline threshold and the continuous growth in cases across all age groups could signal a potential strain on healthcare resources and may necessitate increased preventative measures, such as vaccinations and public health advisories.
