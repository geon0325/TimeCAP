Over the past 24 hours in New York City, temperatures exhibited a notable increasing trend, reaching a peak in the later hours before showing signs of a slight decrease. Humidity levels fluctuated considerably, with a striking spike to full saturation at one point, which could have been indicative of fog or precipitation events, followed by a general decreasing trend that suggests drier conditions setting in. Air pressure gradually decreased, which is often associated with the approach of a low-pressure system that could lead to changing weather patterns, including the possibility of precipitation or storms. Wind speeds varied, with some hours experiencing calm conditions and others showing increased wind activity, which might have contributed to a wind chill effect during cooler temperatures and could signal the movement of weather fronts. The wind direction was predominantly from the west and southwest, with occasional shifts, including a period of calm when the wind direction was variable, which is typical of changing weather conditions.
