Over the past 20 weeks, the data shows a fluctuation in the number of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the average ratio of positive specimens at 6.26%. While the number of specimens tested has generally increased, peaking in the last week at 40,107, the percentage of positive tests has not shown a corresponding upward trend, indicating that the prevalence of influenza among the tested individuals is not necessarily increasing. Influenza A has maintained a relatively low positivity rate, peaking at 0.08% in week 6, but has since decreased to 0.03% in the last week. Influenza B displayed a higher positivity rate than Influenza A, with its peak at 0.09% in week 7, and a consistent presence throughout the period, ending at 0.03%. This data suggests that while testing has ramped up, the positivity rates for both Influenza A and B have remained relatively stable over the 20-week period, which could indicate that current healthcare measures are effective in managing the spread of influenza.
