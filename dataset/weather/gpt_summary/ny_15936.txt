Over the past 24 hours in New York City, there has been a noticeable decline in temperature from a warm peak during the day to a cooler night, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Relative humidity levels have experienced fluctuations, with notably higher values during the cooler early morning hours, which is a common occurrence as cooler air holds less moisture before dropping during the warmer part of the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with only slight variations, suggesting that there have been no significant weather fronts moving through the area that would typically be associated with large pressure changes. Wind speeds varied, with some calmer periods and occasional gustier intervals, especially towards the latter part of the day, which could impact outdoor activities and conditions at sea. Wind direction was predominantly from the south and west, with some variability, which may have influenced the temperature and humidity patterns observed.
