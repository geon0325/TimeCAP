Over the past 24 hours in New York City, the temperature has shown a slight decreasing trend, indicative of a cooling atmosphere. Humidity levels started high but experienced significant fluctuations, decreasing notably before rising again toward the end of the period, which could have affected the perceived comfort level. Air pressure varied, with a notable increase toward the middle of the period, followed by a decrease, and then another increase, suggesting the passage of different air masses over the city. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with a period of higher velocity, which could have influenced wind chill factors, especially during the cooler temperature readings. Wind direction was variable throughout the period, with shifts from northeasterly to westerly and then predominantly to northwesterly, which is consistent with the passage of a weather front and the subsequent change in weather conditions.
