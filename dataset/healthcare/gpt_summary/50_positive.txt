Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable increase in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a significant rise in the latter half of the period. The ratio of positive specimens has escalated from 1.74% in the first week to 21.42% in the twentieth week, exceeding the 20-week average of 6.26%. Influenza A has been the predominant subtype throughout the period, with the positive specimen ratio for Influenza A increasing from 1.03% to 18.77%, a trend that suggests it is driving the overall increase in influenza cases. Influenza B also showed an upward trend but at a slower rate, with its ratio rising from 0.71% to 2.65% over the 20 weeks. This surge in influenza activity indicates a growing burden on the healthcare system, highlighting the need for increased surveillance, vaccination efforts, and public health interventions to manage the rising incidence of influenza cases.
