Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a significant downward trend, falling from 4176.82 to 3785.38, which indicates a bearish sentiment in the market. Concurrently, the VIX, or Volatility Index, has generally increased, peaking at 34.02, which reflects heightened market uncertainty and investor fear. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 also experienced declines, with the former dropping from 27413.88 to 26393.04 and the latter from 7533.00 to 7169.30, suggesting a global risk-off mood. Commodity prices were mixed, with Gold Futures showing a slight downward trend indicative of a decrease in safe-haven demand, while Crude Oil Futures also saw a decline from 116.87 to 105.76, potentially due to concerns over economic growth. The foreign exchange market saw the EUR/USD and USD/JYP fluctuate within a narrow range, indicating relative stability, while the USD/CNY pair showed a slight weakening of the dollar against the yuan.
