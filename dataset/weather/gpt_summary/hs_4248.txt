Over the last 24 hours in Houston, temperatures experienced a typical diurnal cycle with a noticeable drop during the early morning hours followed by a significant rise after sunrise, peaking in the late afternoon. The relative humidity values showed an inverse relationship with temperature, starting high in the cooler night and early morning hours, then dropping as temperatures rose, and slightly increasing again as the temperatures fell. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight decreasing trend toward the end of the period, which could indicate an approaching weather system. Wind speeds varied minimally, with periods of calm and a gradual increase in the latter half of the day, while wind direction shifted throughout the day, predominantly coming from the north and shifting to southeasterly and easterly directions. These weather conditions suggest clear skies for the most part, with no immediate indication of precipitation, but the slight pressure drop may suggest changes on the horizon.
