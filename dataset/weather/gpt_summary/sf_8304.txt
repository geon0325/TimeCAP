Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have fluctuated within a moderate range, showing a typical diurnal pattern with cooler temperatures in the early hours and a gradual warming trend into the afternoon. Relative humidity levels have been high, peaking during the early morning hours, which is consistent with cooler temperatures and could have contributed to fog or mist formation, particularly when humidity reached saturation. Air pressure experienced a notable decrease, suggesting a transition to potentially less stable weather conditions that could lead to increased cloudiness or a chance of precipitation. Wind speeds remained generally light, but there was a significant temporary increase, which could have dispersed any early fog or low clouds, improving visibility. The wind direction varied throughout the day, with shifts that indicate the presence of passing weather fronts or local sea breezes, which are common for coastal cities like San Francisco.
