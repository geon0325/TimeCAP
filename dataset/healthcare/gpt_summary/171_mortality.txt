Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a decreasing trend in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, starting at 15.21% and ending at 9.11%, which is above the average ratio of 7.84%. The total number of deaths fluctuated, with a modest decrease from 76,697 to 60,980. Deaths specifically from pneumonia showed a consistent decline from 11,405 to 5,541, while deaths from influenza also decreased but remained relatively low, ranging from 263 to 12. The highest mortality ratio from these conditions occurred in the first week of the dataset at 15.21%, suggesting a peak in the severity or incidence of these illnesses relative to other causes of death at that time. The observed decrease in the mortality ratio for Influenza or Pneumonia is likely to alleviate some pressure on healthcare resources dedicated to these diseases, but given that the ratio remains above the average, it continues to be a significant concern for healthcare systems.
