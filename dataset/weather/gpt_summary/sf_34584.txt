Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual decline in temperature followed by a steady increase, indicating a typical diurnal temperature variation with cooler temperatures during the early morning hours proceeding to warmer conditions in the afternoon. Humidity levels fluctuated moderately but remained relatively high, suggesting a moist air mass presence in the region that could lead to a perception of mugginess or potential for fog development, especially during periods of peak humidity. Air pressure showed a slight but consistent downward trend, which could be indicative of an approaching weather system that may affect local conditions in the near term. Wind speeds varied, with some hours experiencing calmer conditions and others seeing an uptick in wind activity, particularly towards the latest hours where a noticeable increase could signify the onset of a windier regime. Wind direction was predominantly from the west to southwest, which is typical for San Francisco's coastal climate and can influence the movement of marine air inland, affecting temperatures and fog patterns.
