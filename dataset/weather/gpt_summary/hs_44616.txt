Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual rise in temperature, peaking during the afternoon hours, which is typical for this region, followed by a slight cooling trend in the later hours. Humidity levels were high throughout the day, reaching saturation during the early morning, which could have led to foggy conditions and possibly morning dew. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a minor decrease noted towards the end of the period, which could be indicative of an approaching weather system. Wind speeds varied modestly, with a noticeable increase in the evening that may have contributed to a slight relief from the day's heat. The wind direction was predominantly southerly, with some variability, which is consistent with warm, moist air being drawn into the area, possibly contributing to the high humidity levels experienced.
