Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with a general downward trend, closing lower at 4668.67 compared to the high of 4709.85, indicating potential cautiousness among investors. The VIX, commonly known as the "fear index," has fluctuated significantly, peaking at 31.12, which aligns with the periods of decline in the S&P 500, suggesting increased market uncertainty during this period. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 also experienced fluctuations, with the Nikkei 225 ending on a positive note, while the FTSE 100 showed a modest recovery after a dip. Gold futures, typically a safe-haven asset, witnessed a decline followed by a recovery, ending higher at 1796.60, which could indicate a shift towards risk aversion. Crude oil futures dropped to a low of 65.57 before partially recovering to 72.38, which might reflect concerns over global economic growth and demand, while exchange rates for major currency pairs like EUR/USD and USD/JPY remained relatively stable, with minor fluctuations indicating a steady forex market.
