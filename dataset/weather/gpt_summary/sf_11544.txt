Humidity levels exhibited fluctuations, with a significant spike observed in the early morning, which could be indicative of morning fog or dew, a common occurrence in the region, before stabilizing at moderate levels for the remainder of the day. Air pressure remained relatively steady throughout the day, with a sharp decrease in the late evening hours, suggesting a potential change in weather conditions such as the arrival of a weather front that could lead to precipitation or wind changes. Wind speeds were generally low, with an increase noticed towards the evening, which, in conjunction with the drop in air pressure, may signal the approach of more active weather.
