Over the last 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature followed by a slight cooling trend towards the current hour. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, with a period of full saturation, indicating the likelihood of fog or precipitation during that time, and then a marked decrease suggesting drier air moving into the area. Air pressure has been generally high but showed a decreasing trend, which could signal a change in weather patterns, possibly leading to increased wind speeds or changing weather conditions in the near future. Wind speeds remained light to moderate throughout the period, with a slight increase noted in the later hours. The prevailing wind direction was predominantly from the south to southwest, which is typical for milder air influxes during certain times of the year in New York City.
