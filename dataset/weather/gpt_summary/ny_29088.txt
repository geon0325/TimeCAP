Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a slight decrease in temperature, which has persisted through the day and into the night. Humidity levels saw a significant decline from very high levels in the early hours to much lower values by the evening, suggesting a change in the air mass affecting the region. The air pressure remained relatively stable initially, with a minor fluctuation midday, before a noticeable increase later on, indicating a potential shift in weather patterns possibly leading to clearer skies. Wind speeds varied moderately, maintaining a gentle to fresh breeze throughout the period, with a couple of instances of higher gusts. The wind direction shifted from predominantly westerly to a more northwesterly direction by the end of the 24-hour period, which could bring cooler air into the city.
