Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before slightly decreasing towards the evening. Humidity levels started relatively moderate but showed a significant increase overnight, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air that could lead to a feeling of mugginess. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with a slight rise midday, indicating steady weather conditions without the immediate threat of significant weather events. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a slight uptick during the afternoon, potentially providing some relief from the day's warmth. The wind direction varied, with a notable shift from northeasterly in the early hours to easterly and southeasterly later in the day, which could influence the transport of moisture and heat in the region.
