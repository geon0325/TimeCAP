Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before slightly cooling down towards the evening. Humidity levels remained high throughout the day and night, with a period of complete saturation occurring around midday, which could have led to foggy conditions or precipitations. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight decrease noted toward the end of the 24-hour period, which might suggest an approaching weather system or front. Wind speeds were generally light to calm with variable directions, indicating a lack of strong weather systems moving through the area during this time. The calm wind conditions coupled with high humidity may have contributed to a muggy and potentially uncomfortable atmosphere for residents.
