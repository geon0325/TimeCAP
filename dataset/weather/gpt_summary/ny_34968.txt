Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a slight decrease in temperature, indicating a mild cooling trend. Humidity levels have shown variability but ended on a higher note, suggesting an increase in moisture in the air towards the end of the period. Air pressure has been gradually increasing, which is typically associated with stable weather conditions and might indicate an approaching period of settled weather. Wind speed remained relatively gentle but increased slightly towards the current hour, which could contribute to a perceived decrease in temperature due to wind chill.
