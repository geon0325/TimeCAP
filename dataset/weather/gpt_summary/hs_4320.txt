Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature with a general warming trend, culminating in a peak during the later hours before a subtle decrease toward the end of the period. Humidity levels have been notably high, frequently reaching saturation, which may have contributed to a feeling of mugginess and the potential for fog or mist development, especially during the early morning hours when temperature and humidity combinations were optimal for such conditions. Air pressure exhibited a gentle declining trend, which could indicate the approach of a weather system that may affect local weather conditions in the near future. Wind speeds varied from calm to moderate throughout the day, with a significant shift in direction from predominantly easterly to southerly and then westerly, suggesting a change in the weather pattern. The combination of high humidity, changing wind direction, and decreasing pressure could lead to increased cloud cover and the possibility of precipitation in the coming days.
