Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a slight decrease in temperature, with the temperatures remaining relatively stable throughout the period. Humidity levels varied but showed a tendency to increase, reaching their peak during the period, which indicates a possible presence of more moist air in the region. Air pressure experienced some fluctuations but generally increased towards the latter part of the period, suggesting that a high-pressure system could be settling in the area, which is often associated with more stable weather conditions. Wind speeds were mostly light and did not show significant changes, which is not likely to have a pronounced impact on the city's weather. The wind direction varied but primarily came from the west, suggesting that any weather systems would be moving from inland areas towards the coast.
