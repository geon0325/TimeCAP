Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable increase in the proportion of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the average positivity rate climbing from 1.69% to 19.39%. Influenza A has driven this trend, as evidenced by its positivity rate rising from 1.29% to 18.83%, while Influenza B has shown a relatively stable pattern with minor fluctuations, ending at a 0.56% positivity rate. The peak of Influenza A activity was marked by a significant jump in the ratio of positive specimens, reaching 15.87% in week 19, which is close to the last reported week's ratio of 18.83%. This surge in influenza cases poses a potential strain on healthcare resources, indicating a need for increased vigilance, preventive measures such as vaccination, and possibly antiviral treatment to manage the impact. The data suggests the current influenza season is particularly severe, and public health responses should be tailored to address the increasing burden of influenza infections.
