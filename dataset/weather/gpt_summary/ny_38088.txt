Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, transitioning from below freezing to just above, indicating a slight warming trend. Humidity levels varied considerably, starting at relatively low values, peaking during the night, and then decreasing significantly by the end of the period, which could have influenced the thermal comfort of residents. Air pressure showed a general decreasing trend, suggesting the possibility of changing weather patterns or the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate with some variability, and the predominant wind direction shifted mainly from westerly to northwesterly, which is typical for the passage of a frontal system. These combined weather indicators suggest a dynamic atmosphere, likely leading to changing weather conditions in the near future.
