Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a slight increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before stabilizing. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuation, with a noticeable peak during the early morning hours, indicative of possible early morning fog or dew, and then a gradual decrease throughout the day, suggesting drier conditions as the day progressed. The air pressure remained relatively stable, showing only minor variations which are typical for a region not experiencing any significant weather fronts or storms.
