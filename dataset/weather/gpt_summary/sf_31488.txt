Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature, indicating a relatively stable weather pattern with a minor cooling trend overnight that later stabilized during the day. Humidity levels were notably high, reaching saturation at several points, which is conducive to fog formation, particularly in coastal areas like San Francisco. The air pressure remained largely consistent, with minor variations that are typical for the region and not indicative of any significant weather events. Wind speeds varied moderately with occasional increases that could contribute to cooler perceived temperatures and the dispersal of any fog or low cloud cover. The wind direction shifted throughout the day, with a general tendency towards westerly and southwesterly directions, which is common for San Francisco and can influence the transport of coastal moisture inland.
