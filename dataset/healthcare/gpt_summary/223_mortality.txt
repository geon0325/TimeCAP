Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable upward trend in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia in comparison to the total number of deaths, starting at 8.54% and peaking at 16.83%, which is significantly higher than the average ratio of 7.84%. The total number of deaths increased from 60,147 to 73,352, while deaths from pneumonia rose sharply from 5,122 to 12,316, and deaths from influenza modestly increased from 15 to 32. This trend suggests a worsening situation, possibly due to seasonal factors, an outbreak, or the emergence of more virulent strains. The peak in mortality ratio coincides with a rise in overall deaths, indicating that Influenza and Pneumonia are contributing factors to the increased mortality rate. The healthcare system may need to allocate more resources to manage and prevent these respiratory illnesses, particularly as they represent an increasing proportion of total mortality.
