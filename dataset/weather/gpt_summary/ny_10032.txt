Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, indicating a cooling trend. Humidity levels varied, with a noticeable drop during the latter part of the period, which could have led to a perception of cooler and more comfortable conditions. Air pressure experienced a significant increase midway through the observed timeframe, suggesting the potential onset of a high-pressure system that might bring more stable weather conditions. Wind speeds remained generally light but saw a period of increased intensity, possibly associated with the change in pressure conditions. Throughout the period, wind direction was consistent, primarily coming from the west, before a noticeable shift to a more northwesterly direction coincided with the increased wind speed and air pressure, hinting at a change in the weather pattern.
