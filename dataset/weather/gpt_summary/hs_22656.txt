Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature showed a fluctuating pattern, starting off relatively warm, cooling slightly, and then rising again to warm conditions towards the end of the period. Humidity levels exhibited a gradual decrease after peaking in the early hours, indicating drier air moving into the area as the day progressed. Air pressure remained relatively stable and high throughout the period, suggesting a continued influence of a high-pressure system over the region, which is typically associated with settled weather conditions. Wind speeds were mostly gentle to moderate and increased slightly towards the end of the period, which could contribute to a slight wind chill effect and the dispersion of any local pollution. The wind direction was predominantly from the southeast, consistent with mild and moist air being drawn in from the Gulf of Mexico, which could contribute to cloud formation and the possibility of precipitation if conditions become unstable.
