Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, culminating in significantly warmer conditions by the day's end. During the same period, there was a notable decrease in humidity, suggesting a shift towards drier air as the temperature rose. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight fluctuation indicative of steady weather conditions. Wind speeds were moderate, with a slight increase observed later in the day, while wind direction was predominantly from the north, shifting slightly to the northwest and then back to the north again. This combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and consistent northerly winds could suggest the arrival of a dry, warmer air mass into the region.
