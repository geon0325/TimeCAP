Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable rise in temperature, reaching a peak in the late afternoon before a slight drop towards the evening. Humidity levels were extremely high during the early hours, indicating a likelihood of morning fog or dew, but these levels significantly decreased as the temperature increased, likely leading to more comfortable conditions by the afternoon. Air pressure remained relatively stable initially but saw a minor decrease later in the day, which could suggest an approaching weather system or front. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with an increase observed during the afternoon, potentially aiding in the dispersal of humidity. The prevailing wind direction was southeasterly, shifting more towards the south and southwest as the day progressed, which is typical for warm air movement in the region.
