Over the last 20 weeks, mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia has consistently remained below the average ratio of 7.84%, with a fluctuating but generally declining trend in both the absolute number of deaths and the ratio to total deaths. The highest observed weekly ratio within this period was 6.43% in week 4, while the lowest was 5.00% in week 17, indicating a variable but overall downward trajectory. The number of deaths attributed to influenza has decreased notably in the latter weeks, with the lowest figure of 12 in week 18, suggesting a possible reduction in influenza incidence or effectiveness in treatment and prevention. Pneumonia deaths have also shown a decreasing pattern, with a peak at week 4 (3722 deaths) and a noticeable decline to 2961 deaths by week 20. This data may imply an improvement in public health interventions or seasonal variations affecting the prevalence of these respiratory conditions, which could alleviate some pressure on healthcare resources dedicated to these illnesses.
