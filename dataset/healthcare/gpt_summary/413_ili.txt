Over the past 20 weeks, the proportion of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases across all age groups has steadily declined, with the percentage of patients with ILI symptoms decreasing from a peak of 6.83% to 1.95%. This trend is observed across all age categories, with the most significant drops in the youngest (0-4 years) and school-aged children (5-24 years). Despite the initial figures vastly exceeding the 2.9% benchmark, the ILI rates have consistently fallen below this threshold since week 14, indicating a potential easing of the influenza burden on the healthcare system. The progressive decrease in ILI rates suggests that the peak of the influenza season has passed, and the current levels are now below the threshold of concern. However, continued monitoring is essential to detect any potential changes in the trend that could indicate a resurgence or a new wave of ILI cases.
