Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a slight increase in temperature, indicating a warmer trend throughout the day which would have contributed to a relatively warm climate. Humidity levels remained high with very little fluctuation, suggesting a consistently moist atmosphere, which could lead to a muggy feeling and potentially poor air quality. Air pressure showed minor variations, staying largely stable, which is indicative of steady weather conditions without significant changes. Wind speeds increased toward the latter part of the period, which may have brought some relief from the humidity, although the increase was not substantial enough to indicate any major weather disturbances. The wind direction was predominantly from the south to the southeast, which is typical for this region and can contribute to the transport of warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico into Houston.
