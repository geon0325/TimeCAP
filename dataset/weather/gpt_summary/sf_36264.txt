Over the last 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have exhibited a typical diurnal cycle with a cool overnight period followed by a gradual warming trend during the day. Humidity levels remained high throughout the period, suggesting a persistent moisture presence in the air, which could contribute to overcast conditions or possible fog, particularly during the cooler early hours. Atmospheric pressure has been steadily increasing, indicating a trend towards more stable weather conditions and potentially clearer skies. Wind speeds have shown a general increase through the period, with a notable uptick in the latter hours, which could disperse any lingering humidity or fog. The wind direction has been variable, with a tendency to shift from northerly to westerly and then predominantly easterly directions, which may influence coastal weather patterns and temperatures in the city.
