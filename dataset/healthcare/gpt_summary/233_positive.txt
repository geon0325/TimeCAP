Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable decline in both the number of specimens tested for influenza and the proportion of positive results, with the average positive ratio of 6.26% decreasing to recent weeks consistently below the average. Influenza A has shown a more significant decrease in positive specimen ratio from a high of 1.70% to lows around 0.11%, indicating a substantial reduction in prevalence. Similarly, Influenza B's positive ratios have decreased from a peak of 0.63% to around 0.06%, albeit with less consistency week-to-week. The overall positive specimen ratio has dipped below 1% in the last several weeks, suggesting a downturn in influenza activity. This downward trend in influenza cases is likely to reduce the burden on healthcare resources dedicated to influenza but warrants continuous monitoring for potential fluctuations or new strains.
