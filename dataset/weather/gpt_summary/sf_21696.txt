Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature, with a general cooling trend towards the latter part of the time series. Humidity levels have been high, peaking at night which could have led to foggy conditions, especially given the high humidity and low wind speeds. Air pressure has remained relatively stable throughout the period, indicating a period of settled weather without significant fronts or storms. Wind speeds have been mostly light, and wind direction has been predominantly from the west-northwest, which is typical for San Francisco's climate and indicative of the maritime influence. The combination of high humidity, stable pressure, and light winds could suggest a likelihood of morning fog followed by clearer skies as the day progresses.
