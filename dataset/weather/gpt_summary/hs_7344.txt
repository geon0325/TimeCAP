Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature exhibited a diurnal pattern with the highest values occurring in the afternoon and cooler temperatures observed during the early morning hours. Relative humidity levels were variable, reaching saturation at certain times, which could have led to fog or dew formation, especially when coinciding with cooler temperatures. Air pressure remained relatively stable with only minor fluctuations, suggesting a steady weather pattern without the presence of strong weather fronts. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with calms observed at one point, and wind direction showed variability with shifts primarily between southerly and easterly directions. The combination of high temperatures, varying humidity, and stable air pressure could have resulted in periods of muggy conditions followed by temporary relief for residents.
