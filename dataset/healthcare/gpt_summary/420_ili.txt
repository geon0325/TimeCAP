Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a gradual decline in the proportion of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases relative to the total number of patients, with the ILI ratio decreasing from an initial high of 2.70% to 1.69%. The ILI rates have consistently remained below the 2.9% threshold used to assess the severity of influenza, suggesting a mild influenza season. ILI cases in all age groups have followed a downward trend, with the steepest decline observed in the 5-24 age group, which could indicate a higher rate of recovery or lower transmission within this demographic. The sustained decrease in ILI percentages across the board suggests that the healthcare system is not currently under significant strain from influenza cases. However, continued monitoring is essential to prepare for any potential upticks that could occur, especially considering seasonal patterns or emerging strains.
