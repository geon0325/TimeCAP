Over the past day in Houston, temperatures have shown a slight cooling trend during the night, followed by a gradual increase during the daytime, peaking in the late afternoon. Humidity levels were high during the early hours, reaching full saturation at times, which could have led to foggy conditions, but these levels decreased as temperatures rose, indicating potential evaporation and clearer skies later in the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with a slight increase at one point, suggesting steady weather patterns without significant fronts or storms. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with some increase in velocity towards the end of the period, which could disperse humidity and contribute to changes in weather conditions. The wind direction varied, with a notable shift to a more southerly component in the earlier hours, followed by winds coming from a westerly direction later, which might influence temperature and humidity levels due to regional climatic variations.
