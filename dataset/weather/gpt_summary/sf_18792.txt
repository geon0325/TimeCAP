Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a mild and steady decline in temperature, indicating a cooling trend moving into the nighttime hours. Humidity levels have remained high, peaking at saturation during the early hours which could have resulted in foggy conditions, especially near coastal areas. Air pressure has been notably high and stable, suggesting a continued pattern of calm weather without any immediate signs of significant weather disturbances. Wind speeds have been consistently low, indicating a lack of strong wind events and potentially contributing to the persistence of high humidity levels due to limited air circulation. The wind direction has varied, but with the low wind speeds, it is unlikely to have had a major impact on the local weather conditions.
