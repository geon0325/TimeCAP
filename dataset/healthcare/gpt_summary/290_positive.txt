Over the last 20 weeks, the data shows a fluctuation in the number of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with an overall average positivity rate of 6.26%. The percentage of specimens testing positive for Influenza A has been consistently lower than the overall positivity rate, suggesting that Influenza B has been more prevalent during this period. The highest positivity rate for any single week is 0.15%, which occurred twice during the period, indicating potential peak weeks for influenza transmission. A noticeable decline in the positivity rate for Influenza B from a high of 0.09% to 0.02% in the last week suggests a downward trend for Influenza B. Given these patterns, healthcare systems should remain vigilant for potential new waves of influenza A and B but may expect a possible decrease in Influenza B cases in the immediate future based on recent trends.
