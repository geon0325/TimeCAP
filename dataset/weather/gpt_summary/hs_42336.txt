Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before a slight decline towards the evening. The humidity levels showed a marked increase during the early morning hours, possibly contributing to muggy conditions, but decreased as temperatures peaked, indicating a typical diurnal pattern. Air pressure remained relatively steady throughout the day with only minor fluctuations, suggesting stable atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate but picked up significantly in the evening, which could help disperse humidity and offer some relief from the heat. The wind direction varied, with a predominant shift from easterly to northerly and then to easterly again, which is common for Houston and could be influenced by local sea breezes and land features.
