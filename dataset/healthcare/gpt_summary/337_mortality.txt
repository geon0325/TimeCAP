Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a fluctuating but overall increasing trend in the mortality ratio of deaths due to influenza or pneumonia compared to total deaths, starting at 5.60% and rising to 6.45%, which is below the average ratio of 7.84%. The number of deaths attributed to influenza has seen a significant increase in the last three weeks of the time series, with a notable jump from 57 to 156 deaths. Conversely, deaths from pneumonia have exhibited a less dramatic but steady increase over the period, culminating in the highest count in the last week at 3779 deaths. Despite these increases, the overall ratio of mortality from influenza or pneumonia remains below the average, suggesting either a decrease in total deaths from other causes or an underestimation in the reported figures for these respiratory diseases. This trend warrants close monitoring as a surge in influenza or pneumonia-related deaths could signal the onset of an epidemic, with implications for healthcare resource allocation and public health interventions.
