Humidity levels showed a slight fluctuation but notably increased towards the end of the period, indicating potential for increased cloud cover or precipitation. Air pressure experienced a steady decline throughout most of the day, reaching its lowest point in the latter hours, which could suggest the approach of a weather system.
