Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have shown some fluctuations with a notable decrease during the early morning hours before rising again towards the afternoon. Meanwhile, humidity levels experienced a significant increase, reaching their peak in the late afternoon, which could have influenced the comfort levels and potentially led to muggy conditions. Air pressure has been relatively stable, with a slight uptick, suggesting a period of settled weather without significant fronts or storms. Wind speeds have been mostly light, with occasional gentle breezes, and the wind direction has been predominantly from the south-southeast, which is typical for Houston and can contribute to the transport of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico into the area. The combination of higher humidity, stable air pressure, and light winds from a moisture-rich direction indicates a likelihood of warm and humid conditions, possibly leading to fog or mist in the early hours if temperatures drop near the dew point.
