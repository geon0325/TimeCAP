Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the later hours of the day, indicative of typical diurnal variation with warmer conditions in the afternoon. Humidity levels fluctuated, with a notable spike to full saturation suggesting the possibility of fog or precipitation during the night or early morning hours, followed by a general decrease as temperatures rose. Air pressure showed a slight but consistent downward trend, which could signal an approaching weather system that may affect local conditions. Wind speeds remained relatively light with occasional calm periods, and despite some variability, the wind direction was predominantly from the north, shifting towards the east and northeast at times. These conditions suggest a stable weather pattern with no significant weather events, but the decrease in air pressure bears monitoring for any changes that might suggest incoming unsettled weather.
