Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a noticeable decrease in temperature during the early morning hours, followed by a significant increase towards the afternoon, indicative of a typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels have exhibited considerable fluctuations, reaching a peak coinciding with the lowest temperatures, which is expected as cooler air can hold less moisture before condensation occurs. Air pressure has varied but included a noticeable spike, possibly suggesting the transient influence of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds have been mostly light and variable, with a general trend toward calmer conditions, which could contribute to the development of fog in coastal areas. Wind direction has been predominantly from the north and west, with occasional shifts, which is common for San Francisco's maritime climate influenced by both land and oceanic patterns.
