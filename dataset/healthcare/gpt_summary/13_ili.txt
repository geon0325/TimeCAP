Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a sustained decrease in the overall number of patients presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI), which corresponds with a downward trend in the ratio of ILI patients across all age groups. The ILI ratio remains consistently below the baseline, suggesting that the influenza activity is currently not a significant burden on the healthcare system. Notably, the youngest age group (0-4 years) consistently shows the highest ILI counts, emphasizing the need for vigilance in monitoring and protecting this vulnerable population. Despite the general decline, there is a slight increase in ILI ratios in recent weeks across some age groups, which warrants close surveillance to detect any early signs of an uptick in influenza activity. The current low ILI activity could allow healthcare providers to allocate resources to other areas but should remain prepared for potential future increases in ILI cases.
