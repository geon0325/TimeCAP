Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has seen minor fluctuations but has generally maintained a range indicative of a warm environment. Humidity levels remained high throughout the period, often reaching saturation, which could have led to a muggy feeling and potentially contributed to the development of fog or mist. Air pressure was remarkably stable, with a slight increase at one point, suggesting steady weather patterns without the presence of significant frontal systems. Wind speeds were consistently light, indicating a calm atmosphere with limited wind chill effect or dispersion of any pollutants. The wind direction varied but mostly stayed within an easterly to southeasterly range, which is typical for this region and can contribute to moisture influx from the Gulf of Mexico.
