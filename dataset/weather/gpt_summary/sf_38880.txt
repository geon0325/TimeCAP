Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a gradual decrease in temperature followed by a noticeable increase, suggesting a typical diurnal variation with cooler temperatures at night warming up towards the afternoon. Humidity levels exhibited some fluctuations but remained relatively high throughout the period, which could contribute to a perception of chilliness in the air during cooler hours and a muggy feeling when temperatures peaked. Air pressure showed an unusual pattern with a significant drop towards the end of the period, indicating a potential change in weather conditions such as the approach of a weather front that could lead to unsettled weather. Wind speed varied significantly, with stronger winds earlier in the period calming down before picking up again, which might affect sea conditions and could be of interest to marine activities. Lastly, the wind direction was predominantly from the west with some shifts, which is typical for coastal San Francisco and may bring in marine air influencing local weather conditions.
