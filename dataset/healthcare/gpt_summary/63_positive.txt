The data indicates a peak in the number of positive influenza specimens around weeks 9 and 10, with the highest ratios of positive tests at 24.51% and 24.73% respectively, reflecting a significant wave of influenza infections that could have stressed healthcare resources. Subsequently, there has been a steady decline in both the number of specimens testing positive and the positivity ratio, with the latest week showing only 5.92% positive specimens, suggesting a possible easing of the influenza season. However, the influenza B strain showed an increase in its proportion of the positive cases over time, peaking at weeks 13 and 14 with positivity ratios of 10.56% and 11.26% respectively, before declining, indicating a shift in the dominant circulating strain. Despite the overall decline in positive cases, the consistent presence of both Influenza A and B strains indicates sustained viral circulation that requires continued monitoring. Healthcare systems should remain vigilant for potential surges and encourage preventive measures such as vaccination and hygiene practices to manage the tail end of the influenza season.
