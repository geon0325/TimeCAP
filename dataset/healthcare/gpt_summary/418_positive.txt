Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a significant upward trend in the number of respiratory specimens testing positive for both Influenza A and B, with a particularly sharp increase observed in the ratios for Influenza B. The testing volume peaked at week 9 with 144,858 specimens, coinciding with the highest positive specimens ratio of 8.49%, after which the volume slightly decreased but the positivity ratio continued to rise, reaching a peak of 18.27% at week 12. The latest data show a decrease in the positivity rate for Influenza A to 8.61%, while Influenza B continues to rise, now accounting for 6.93% of positive specimens. The overall positive ratio has stabilized around 15.5% in the most recent weeks, suggesting a potential plateau in the spread of influenza. These trends indicate a substantial burden on the healthcare system, necessitating ongoing surveillance, resource allocation for patient care, and continued public health messaging on influenza prevention and treatment.
