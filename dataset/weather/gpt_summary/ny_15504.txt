Over the past 24 hours in New York City, there has been a gradual increase in temperature, culminating in a peak during the latter part of the period, before a slight decrease towards the end. Humidity levels experienced some fluctuations, with notable peaks that could have contributed to periods of increased mugginess, especially when the temperature was at its highest. Air pressure remained relatively stable, showing a slight increase mid-period which suggests stable weather conditions without significant weather fronts moving through the area during this time. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with occasional calms, and there was variability in wind direction, indicating the absence of a dominant weather system. The combination of rising temperatures, variable humidity, and stable air pressure likely resulted in comfortable but potentially warmer weather conditions for this time of year.
