Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a moderate decrease in temperature, beginning well above average temperatures before gradually cooling down to more typical values. Humidity levels have shown significant fluctuations, with notably high peaks and some very low dips, suggesting variable atmospheric moisture that could have influenced local weather conditions such as fog formation or dissipation. Air pressure has remained relatively stable, with minor variations that are typical for coastal areas and unlikely to have driven any significant weather changes. Wind speeds have been mostly light and displayed little variance, which could lead to the accumulation of pollutants or fog in the absence of stronger dispersing winds. The wind direction has been variable, with shifts from northwesterly to easterly and then predominantly westerly, which is characteristic of San Francisco's weather patterns influenced by both land and oceanic factors.
