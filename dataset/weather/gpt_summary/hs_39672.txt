Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced relatively stable temperatures with a gradual increase during the day, which is typical for the region's climate. Humidity levels have been high, often reaching saturation, suggesting a likelihood of fog or mist, especially during the early hours when temperatures were lower. Air pressure has been steady and slightly on the rise, indicating stable weather conditions without the immediate approach of a significant weather system. Wind speeds have varied but have generally been light to moderate, with some higher gusts that would have likely contributed to a perceived drop in temperature. Wind direction has shown variability, with winds primarily coming from the south-east, which is consistent with the Gulf of Mexico's influence on Houston's weather patterns.
