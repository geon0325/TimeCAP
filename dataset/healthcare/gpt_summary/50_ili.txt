Over the last 20 weeks, the incidence of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) has shown fluctuations, with a noticeable increase in the ratio of ILI patients that peaked well above the baseline, indicating a significant period of higher-than-usual ILI activity. This peak was followed by a gradual decrease in ILI percentages across all age groups, returning below the threshold of concern. The data reveals that age groups 5-24 and 25-49 experienced the highest surge in ILI cases, which may have implications for school and workplace transmission dynamics. The subsequent decline in ILI cases across all age demographics suggests that the ILI activity is currently subsiding and moving towards a period of lower transmission. Nonetheless, the healthcare system should remain vigilant for possible fluctuations and maintain preparedness for increases in ILI cases, which could stress healthcare resources.
