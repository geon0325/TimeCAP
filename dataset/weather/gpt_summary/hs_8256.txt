Over the last 24 hours in Houston, there has been a trend of rising temperatures reaching peak values during the afternoon, indicative of warm and potentially uncomfortable conditions, especially when considering the lower humidity levels recorded concurrently during these peak temperature hours. Humidity levels were highest during the early morning hours, consistent with typical diurnal patterns and possibly contributing to morning mist or fog conditions. Air pressure has remained relatively stable with a slight fluctuation, suggesting steady weather patterns without the immediate influence of strong frontal systems. Wind speeds increased towards the later part of the period, which could be associated with the arrival of a weather front or system, though no dramatic changes in wind direction were observed, with winds generally originating from the southeast to the east. The combination of high temperatures, decreasing humidity through the day, and increasing wind speeds could elevate discomfort for individuals outdoors and may have implications for energy demand and use within the city.
