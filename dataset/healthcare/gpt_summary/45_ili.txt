Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a fluctuating but overall increasing trend in the percentage of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) patients across all age groups, with a noticeable spike in the reported ratio of ILI patients surpassing the baseline of 2.9% in the latter weeks. The age group of 5-24 years consistently showed the highest number of ILI cases, suggesting a higher transmission rate or susceptibility within this demographic. Notably, there has been a significant rise in ILI cases in the older age groups (50-64 and 65 or more), which could increase the demand for healthcare services due to the potential for more severe illness in these populations. After a period of escalation, the ILI patient ratio has shown a recent decline, yet it remains above the baseline, indicating that the influenza activity is still at a concerning level. This sustained elevation in ILI cases may continue to strain healthcare resources, necessitating ongoing surveillance and possibly increased vaccination efforts or public health interventions to mitigate the spread.
