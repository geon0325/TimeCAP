Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature exhibited a significant diurnal variation, with a noticeable increase during the day followed by a cooler trend overnight into the early morning. Humidity levels fluctuated moderately, reaching a peak during the cooler early morning hours, which is typical as cooler air can hold less moisture, and then decreased as temperatures rose. Air pressure showed a gradual declining trend, suggesting a possible change in weather patterns, such as the approach of a frontal system or weather disturbance. Wind speeds were generally light but picked up in the later hours, which could contribute to a shift in weather conditions, possibly ushering in a new air mass. Wind direction was predominantly from the south to southeast, which in Houston is often associated with warmer, more humid air being drawn in from the Gulf of Mexico.
