Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has experienced fluctuations, with a notable decline from its peak of 4701.46 to 4620.64, suggesting potential volatility and investor caution. The VIX, or Fear Index, has generally trended upwards, moving from 17.91 to 21.57, indicating increased market uncertainty. Global markets show similar uncertainty, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 and the UK’s FTSE 100 both demonstrating volatility, though the FTSE 100 shows a slight uptrend towards the most recent days. Gold futures, traditionally a safe-haven asset, have seen an increase from 1783.50 to 1803.80, which further implies a shift towards risk aversion among investors. Meanwhile, the stability in the major currency pairs EUR/USD and USD/CNY suggests that currency markets have remained relatively calm, with the minor fluctuations in the USD/JPY not indicating any significant flight from or towards the dollar.
