The analysis of the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data over the last 20 weeks reveals a steady increase in the percentage of ILI patients across all age groups, although the overall ratio remains below the epidemic threshold of 2.9%. The most significant rise in ILI cases is observed in the youngest (0-4 years) and school-age (5-24 years) populations, which could indicate higher transmission rates within these age groups, potentially due to close contact settings such as daycare centers and schools. While the increase is consistent across all age categories, the growth rate in ILI cases for adults (25-64 years) and seniors (65 years or older) is less pronounced than in the younger age groups. Despite the increase, the current ILI ratio suggests that the healthcare system is not yet at an epidemic level, which may allow for continued routine handling of ILI cases without overburdening healthcare resources. However, the upward trend in ILI rates warrants close monitoring as a further increase could signal a shift toward an epidemic, necessitating additional healthcare measures and resources.
