Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have exhibited a mild diurnal variation with cooler temperatures recorded in the early hours and a gradual warming trend observed during the day. Humidity levels showed fluctuations but remained relatively high, suggesting the presence of moisture in the air which could contribute to a sensation of chilliness despite warmer temperatures. Air pressure has been stable and slightly increased, indicative of a calm weather pattern with no immediate signs of significant weather disturbances. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate with some periods of calm; however, an increase in wind speed was noted towards the end of the period, which could affect local temperature perceptions and contribute to cooler wind chill factors. Wind direction varied throughout the day but predominantly came from the western quadrant, which is typical for San Francisco's coastal climate and can influence the distribution of marine air and fog over the city.
