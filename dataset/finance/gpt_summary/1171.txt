Over the past 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a downward trend, decreasing from a high of 4515.77 to 4337.44, indicating increased market uncertainty or potential bearish sentiment. The VIX, which measures market volatility, has risen from 13.09 to 16.90, aligning with the decrease in the S&P 500 and suggesting heightened investor anxiety. In contrast, international indices such as the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 have shown resilience, with the Nikkei rebounding after a dip and the FTSE 100 reaching a high of 7711.40 before a slight retreat, reflecting localized market dynamics that may offer diversification opportunities. Commodities such as Gold and Crude Oil Futures experienced fluctuations with Gold peaking at 1945.60 before declining slightly and Crude Oil reaching a high of 91.48, then tapering off, which could indicate commodity-specific drivers rather than broader economic trends. Exchange rates for EUR/USD and USD/JPY have seen minor fluctuations, while USD/CNY remained relatively stable with a slight increase, suggesting currency markets are currently less volatile in comparison to equities and commodities.
