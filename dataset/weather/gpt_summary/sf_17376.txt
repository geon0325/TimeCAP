Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature, with the general trend showing a modest increase towards the end of the period. The humidity levels started relatively high and saw a gradual decrease, suggesting a possible clearing of skies or reduction in moisture content in the air. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable, albeit with a slight downward trend, which could indicate the potential for changing weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally light and showed an increasing trend in the latter hours, while wind direction varied significantly throughout the period, reflecting the variable nature of coastal weather patterns. These indicators suggest the city may have had a cool and potentially foggy start, with conditions likely becoming clearer and slightly warmer as the day progressed.
