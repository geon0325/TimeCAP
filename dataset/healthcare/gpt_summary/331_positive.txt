Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the rate of positive respiratory specimens for influenza, with an initial increase in positivity rates, reaching a peak between weeks 9 and 10 at 9.50% and 9.89%, respectively, followed by a consistent decline to 1.69% by week 20. The majority of positive cases were attributed to Influenza A, which also saw a peak (9.45% and 9.85%) in the same period, indicating a predominance of this strain during this influenza season. The percentage of Influenza B remained significantly lower, never exceeding 0.17%, suggesting limited impact on the overall positivity rates. The observed decline in positivity rates suggests a possible waning of the influenza season, which could lead to a decrease in healthcare system burden related to influenza in the upcoming weeks. However, the healthcare system should remain vigilant for any signs of resurgence and ensure vaccination and preventive measures are maintained to control potential spreads.
