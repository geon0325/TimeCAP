Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a noticeable fluctuation in temperature, showing a warming trend during the day with a peak in the late afternoon followed by a gradual cooling towards the early hours of the morning. The relative humidity reached saturation during the night and early morning hours, which may have led to fog or dew formation, but decreased significantly as temperatures rose. Air pressure varied slightly, with a notable dip observed midday, potentially indicating the passage of a weather front or system through the area. Wind speeds remained mostly calm with a few instances of light breeze; the wind direction was variable throughout the day, suggesting a lack of a dominant weather system. Overall, the combination of high humidity at night and increasing temperatures during the day could result in muggy conditions, with the potential for localized weather events influenced by the fluctuating air pressure.
