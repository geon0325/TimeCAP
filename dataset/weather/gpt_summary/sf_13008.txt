Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before slowly declining towards the evening. Humidity levels displayed a fluctuating trend, with a noticeable increase during the early morning hours, likely contributing to a sense of increased chill in the air. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively steady, indicating stable weather conditions without significant changes in the weather pattern. Wind speeds were predominantly light to moderate with some variability, while the wind direction shifted throughout the day, starting from the southwest and gradually moving to a more northerly and easterly direction, then returning to southerly winds by the end of the period.
