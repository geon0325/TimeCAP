Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable increase in the proportion of deaths attributed to influenza and pneumonia relative to the total number of deaths, surpassing the average ratio of 7.84% in the latter half of the observed period. The mortality ratio from these causes peaked at 9.15% in week 14, following a steady rise from week 1 when it was at 6.07%, indicating a concerning upward trend. Despite a slight decrease in the most recent weeks to 7.38%, the ratio remains below the 20-week high, suggesting a potential easing of the upward trend, but still higher than the initial weeks. The absolute number of deaths from pneumonia has shown fluctuations but remains elevated, while deaths from influenza have seen a marked increase in the middle weeks, notably spiking in week 10. This data suggests a significant strain on healthcare resources due to respiratory illnesses and underscores the need for continued monitoring and potential reinforcement of preventive health measures.
