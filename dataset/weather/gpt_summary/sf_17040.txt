Over the last 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have shown a fluctuating trend with a general increase towards the end of the period, suggesting a warming trend moving into the current day. Humidity levels were relatively high throughout the period, starting moderately but increasing significantly overnight, which could have led to foggy conditions, particularly when combined with the stable air pressure that persisted. The air pressure remained remarkably consistent, indicating a period of stable weather without the presence of significant frontal systems. Wind speeds were very low and showed little to no variation, which would have contributed to the persistence of any fog or mist, especially during the night and early morning hours. Wind direction varied but included a notable shift, suggesting a change in the local wind pattern, which could affect coastal conditions and temperature distribution slightly.
