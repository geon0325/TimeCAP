Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has exhibited a downward trend, starting at 3443.62 and closing at 3315.57, indicating a potential shift towards a bearish market sentiment. Correspondingly, the VIX, which measures market volatility, remained elevated with spikes, suggesting increased market uncertainty and risk. In contrast, the Nikkei 225 showed relative stability, with minor fluctuations and a closing value consistent with the opening value, which might indicate resilience in the Japanese market. Gold futures declined from 1911.80 to 1898.60, reflecting a slight decrease in demand for safe-haven assets, while crude oil futures experienced a more pronounced drop from 43.35 to 39.60, which could signal concerns over global energy demand. Exchange rates saw the USD weakening against the JPY and CNY, but remaining relatively stable against the EUR, highlighting a mixed performance in currency markets that could influence international trade and investment flows.
