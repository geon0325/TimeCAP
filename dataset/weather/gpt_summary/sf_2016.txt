Over the last 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperature has shown minor fluctuations but generally maintained a steady range, indicating a stable weather pattern without significant warm or cool spells. Humidity levels experienced a gradual decline through the day, suggesting a trend towards drier conditions, which often accompanies an increase in air pressure that was also observed throughout the period. Air pressure has seen a steady increase for most of the time, indicating fair weather conditions, but a sharp decrease in the final hours could signal an incoming change in weather patterns.
