Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 showed modest fluctuations with a slight upward trend, closing higher by approximately 1% from its starting point, indicating a cautious optimism among investors. The VIX, commonly known as the "fear index," saw a peak mid-period, suggesting increased market volatility, but it has since retreated, which may signal a return to less turbulent market conditions. International indices such as Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 experienced similar volatility with a general recovery trend, hinting at synchronized global market movements. Commodity prices, with Gold Futures and Crude Oil Futures, both rose, with gold increasing by approximately 7.5%, which may reflect investors' hedging against inflation and a potential increase in energy demand as oil prices also edged higher. Currency exchange rates remained relatively stable with minor strengthening of the Euro and the Chinese Yuan against the US Dollar, while the USD/JPY pair showed slight depreciation, which could influence international trade dynamics and cross-border investment flows.
