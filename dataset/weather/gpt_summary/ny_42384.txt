Wind speeds were generally light, with some slight increases towards the evening, but overall, there was no indication of strong winds. The wind direction varied but included periods of southerly and northerly winds, with a notable shift to northerly winds in the late afternoon and evening, which could have influenced the slight decrease in temperature and changes in humidity levels.
