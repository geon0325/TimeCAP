Over the last 20 weeks, the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza in the analyzed dataset averaged 6.26%, with a decrease noted in the positivity rates from the initial weeks to a low around week 8, followed by a variable increase in subsequent weeks. The number of specimens tested showed a general declining trend over the period, with the highest volume of tests occurring in week 1 (34,089 tests) and the lowest in week 20 (22,366 tests). Influenza A and B both showed fluctuations in their detection rates, with Influenza A peaking at a positivity rate of 0.08% in week 15 and Influenza B reaching its highest positivity rate of 0.10% in both week 1 and week 20. Week 15 marked the peak for the combined positivity rate for both influenza types at 0.15%, which is more than double the lowest recorded combined positivity rate of 0.07% in week 8. These trends suggest a seasonal variability in influenza activity with potential implications for healthcare resource allocation and public health strategies, emphasizing the need for continued surveillance and possibly increased vaccination efforts during peak periods of influenza activity.
