Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has shown a typical diurnal pattern with a peak during the daytime and cooling during the night, staying within a comfortable range for this time of year. The relative humidity experienced a significant decrease as the day progressed, indicating the presence of drier air moving into the area, which is consistent with the observed decrease in air pressure towards the evening. Meanwhile, air pressure remained relatively stable, with only minor fluctuations suggesting stable atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds varied modestly and were generally light to moderate, with the most notable increase around the middle of the day, which could have contributed to the mixing of air and the observed drop in humidity. The wind direction was variable throughout the period, with a tendency to shift, which could indicate the passage of a weather front or the influence of local weather systems in the region.
