Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a significant increase in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the ratio of positive specimens rising from 0.13% to 5.98%, peaking at 6.23% in week 9. The number of specimens tested exhibited an increasing trend until week 11, followed by a noticeable decline; however, the number of positive cases, particularly for Influenza A, continued to grow, suggesting an escalating transmission rate. Influenza A has been the predominant strain with its positivity rate increasing from 0.05% to 5.91%, while Influenza B remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, indicating a less significant role in the current influenza season. The peak positivity rate for Influenza A (6.17%) in week 9 correlates with the overall peak, demonstrating its dominance in driving the surge. This upward trend in influenza cases could strain healthcare resources and necessitates a continued public health response to mitigate the impact on the healthcare system.
