Over the last 20 weeks, the testing of respiratory specimens has revealed that the average positivity rate for influenza is 6.26%, with fluctuations observed in the weekly ratios. The data indicates a declining trend in the proportion of Influenza A positive specimens, starting at 0.78% and ending at 0.88%, after reaching a low of 0.37%. In contrast, Influenza B showed an initial increase in positivity rate, peaking at 0.78%, before decreasing to 0.32% by the end of the period. The overall positivity rate for both types of influenza peaked at 1.31% in week 15, subsequently falling to 1.21% by week 20. These trends suggest a seasonal variation in influenza activity and could influence healthcare resource allocation, such as the distribution of antivirals, vaccination campaigns, and the management of hospital admissions.
