Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 exhibited moderate volatility, with a general upward trend, closing slightly higher from 4686.75 to 4793.54. The VIX, which is inversely related to market confidence, trended downwards, indicating a decrease in market volatility and potentially increasing investor confidence. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 both showed resilience, with the Nikkei 225 making a notable jump on the last day, and the FTSE 100 reflecting a steady increase, ending substantially higher, which suggests positive sentiment in the Asian and European markets.

The Crude Oil Futures rose consistently, reflecting a potential increase in energy prices, while the currency exchange rates remained largely stable with slight strengthening in the USD against the JPY and CNY, hinting at a stronger US dollar.
