Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in Influenza-like Illness (ILI) activity, with the ratio of ILI patients starting above the baseline and peaking mid-period before declining steadily to below baseline levels in the most recent weeks. The highest burden of ILI was observed among the younger populations, specifically those aged 0-4 and 5-24, with their ILI patient counts initially being the highest and showing significant variability throughout the period. A consistent decrease in the number of ILI patients across all age groups was evident in the latter part of the time series, indicating a potential easing of ILI incidence. Despite this decline, healthcare systems should remain vigilant, particularly for the youngest and oldest age groups, who are often at higher risk for complications from ILI. The observed trends suggest that while the ILI activity is currently lessening, early planning for future seasons, along with ongoing surveillance, is crucial for timely response and resource allocation.
