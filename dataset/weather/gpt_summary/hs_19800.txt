Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, transitioning from cold to milder conditions. Humidity levels remained relatively high throughout the period, suggesting a moist atmosphere which could lead to fog or mist formation, particularly when the temperature was at its lowest. Air pressure was notably high and showed a slight decreasing trend, which is often associated with stable weather conditions, although the possibility of a gradual change cannot be ruled out. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate and decreased as the period progressed, which may have contributed to the persistence of high humidity levels due to reduced air mixing. The wind direction varied significantly, indicating the passage of different air masses over the area, which could lead to changes in weather patterns, such as shifts in temperature and moisture levels.
