Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the rate of influenza positivity among respiratory specimens, with the overall average positivity ratio standing at 6.26%. The data indicates a peak in the percentage of positive specimens for both Influenza A and B around weeks 9 and 10, with the highest recorded values being 9.50% and 0.17% respectively. Since then, there has been a general downward trend in the positivity rates, with the most recent week showing a significant decrease to 3.31%. Influenza A has been the dominant strain throughout the period, with its positivity rate consistently higher than that of Influenza B, which remained relatively low. This trend suggests that healthcare resources may have been particularly strained during the peak periods, but the recent decline could indicate a potential easing of the burden on the healthcare system.
