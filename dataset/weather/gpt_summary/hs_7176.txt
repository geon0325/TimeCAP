Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has shown a typical diurnal cycle with the warmest conditions occurring during the late afternoon and the coolest during the early morning hours. Humidity levels have fluctuated significantly, peaking in the early morning, which suggests a likelihood of morning dew or fog formation, and decreasing during the afternoon, likely leading to more comfortable conditions. Air pressure has remained relatively stable, with a slight decreasing trend in the most recent hours, indicating a potential change in the weather pattern may be on the horizon. Wind speeds have been mostly light with some variability, and there has been a notable shift in wind direction from predominantly westerly to more northerly, which could bring changes in temperature and moisture levels. This combination of factors suggests that while the weather has been relatively stable, there may be subtle shifts in conditions forthcoming.
