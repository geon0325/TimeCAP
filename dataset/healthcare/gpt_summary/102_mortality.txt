Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a fluctuating but overall decreasing trend in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia relative to total deaths, with a peak of 8.33% in the second week followed by a gradual decline to 6.15% in the final week. Despite this decline in the percentage ratio, the actual number of deaths from Influenza showed significant volatility, with a notable peak of 671 deaths in the second week and then a sharp decrease to 97 deaths by the twentieth week. Pneumonia deaths started at 3987 and experienced a downward trend, ending at 3223, showing a consistent decline over the period. The total number of deaths fluctuated with slight variations, starting at 59505 and ending at a low point of 53971, without exhibiting a clear trend. This overall decrease in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia may indicate an improvement in the management of these conditions, but the healthcare system should remain vigilant due to the observed volatility and the potential for seasonal or unpredictable spikes in cases.
