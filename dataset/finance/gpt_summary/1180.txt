Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 experienced moderate volatility, opening at 4487.46 and closing at 4308.50, indicating a downward trend in the market. The VIX, which measures market volatility, trended upwards from 13.80 to 17.45, aligning with the increased uncertainty in equity markets. International markets also reflected some instability, with the Nikkei 225 showing a significant drop, particularly noticeable in the latter days, moving from 32467.76 to 30994.67, while the FTSE 100 fluctuated but ended slightly higher at 7494.60 from an opening of 7496.90. Gold futures, often considered a safe-haven asset, saw an increase from 1923.30 to 1830.20, reflecting a flight to safety amid market turbulence, whereas Crude Oil futures declined from 87.29 to 82.79, suggesting potential concerns over global demand. Finally, the exchange rates show the dollar strengthening against the yen (from 147.11 to 148.46), holding steady against the Chinese yuan (from 7.23 to 7.20), and showing slight appreciation against the euro (from 1.07 to 1.05), which could indicate a flight to the perceived safety of the dollar during uncertain market conditions.
