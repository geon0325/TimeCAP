Over the last 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before beginning to cool down slightly towards the evening. Humidity levels have fluctuated significantly, starting at moderate levels, increasing to very high in the early morning, indicative of possible fog or mist, and then decreasing sharply as temperatures rose, suggesting clearer conditions. Air pressure remained relatively steady throughout the day, with only minor fluctuations, indicating stable weather conditions without significant fronts or storms. Wind speeds varied from calm to moderate, with a peak in the late afternoon, which could have contributed to a temporary decrease in humidity and dispersal of any earlier fog or mist. The wind direction was predominantly from the south to southwest, shifting to the west and northwest later in the day, which is typical for the transport of warmer air masses into the region.
