Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have exhibited a typical diurnal pattern with a cooling trend overnight reaching its lowest just before sunrise, followed by a gradual increase after dawn. Relative humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, which is common due to lower temperatures and possibly some nocturnal coastal influence, but decreased as temperatures rose. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, indicating a lack of significant weather systems moving through the area that would drastically affect the weather. Wind speeds were generally light to gentle and showed a slight increase towards the end of the 24-hour period, suggesting a possible change in weather conditions approaching. The wind direction was predominantly from the south-west, which is typical for San Francisco's maritime climate and influences the cool, moist air experienced in the region.
