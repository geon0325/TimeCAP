The VIX, commonly known as the fear gauge, has decreased from 30.15 to 20.81, suggesting a decline in market volatility and increased stability. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have also experienced upward movements, with the Nikkei 225 rising from 26526.82 to 28149.84 and the FTSE 100 modestly climbing from 7458.30 to 7483.40, reflecting a positive sentiment in global markets.

Gold Futures have seen some volatility but ended with a slight downtrend from 1899.40 to 1953.80, which may indicate a shift in investor preference towards riskier assets as confidence improves. The crude oil futures have risen sharply from 95.72 to 113.90, which could signal increasing energy costs and contribute to inflationary pressures, while major currency pairs such as EUR/USD and USD/JPY have remained relatively stable, indicating a steadiness in foreign exchange markets despite broader economic uncertainty.
