Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the latest hours, indicative of a warming trend. Relative humidity levels varied significantly, with a notable spike to full saturation, suggesting the presence of fog or mist during the cooler early hours, followed by a decrease in humidity as temperatures rose. Air pressure remained relatively stable for most of the period, with a slight fluctuation mid-period, before a more pronounced drop in the final hours, which could signal an approaching weather system. The wind speed showed variability with periods of calm and gusts; the latter may have contributed to the dispersal of any early fog or mist. Predominant wind directions generally ranged from westerly to northwesterly, which is typical for the region and can influence coastal weather conditions.
