Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a general upward trend, closing higher at 3334.69 from an opening of 3253.05, indicating a relatively bullish market sentiment. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, experienced an increase mid-period with a peak of 18.23, correlating with a dip in the S&P 500, but has since decreased to 15.15, suggesting a stabilization in investor confidence. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 have experienced volatility with both indices showing a recovery in recent days after some mid-period declines, closing at 23319.56 and 7482.50, respectively. Gold Futures have seen a rise in value, peaking at 1583.50, potentially due to investors seeking safe-haven assets amidst market uncertainties, but have slightly receded to 1557.80. Crude Oil Futures have been on a declining trend, closing at 50.75 from an opening of 59.61, which could be indicative of concerns over global demand, while the foreign exchange rates have remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, but there's a noticeable depreciation of the USD against the CNY in the last few days, moving from 6.94 to 7.00.
