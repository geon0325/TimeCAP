Over the last 20 weeks, the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) incidence has displayed a downward trend, consistently staying below the baseline threshold, which suggests a relatively mild influenza season. The highest burden of ILI has been observed in the youngest age group (0-4 years), but this has also followed the overall declining pattern. Notably, all age groups have seen a decrease in ILI cases, with the oldest age group (65 years or more) consistently representing the smallest proportion of ILI cases. The reduction in ILI ratios across all age groups indicates a decreased demand on healthcare resources specific to influenza management. Despite the current low ILI activity, continued monitoring is essential to prepare for any potential upticks that could strain healthcare systems, especially considering vulnerable populations such as the very young and elderly.
