The provided data indicates an overall fluctuation in the number of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases over the last 20 weeks, with a peak ratio of ILI patients occurring mid-time series, which has since been on a downward trend, currently sitting below the baseline threshold. The age group most significantly affected was 5-24 years, which experienced the highest number of ILI patients, and the magnitude of cases in this cohort appears to be a driving factor in the overall ILI percentage. Notably, while all age groups followed a similar trend with a rise and subsequent fall in ILI cases, the youngest (0-4 years) and oldest (65 or more) age groups accounted for fewer cases throughout the period, suggesting a relatively lower transmission or reporting rate in these populations. The recent decrease in ILI patient ratio could imply a waning of the influenza season or the effectiveness of preventative measures, but it also underscores the need for ongoing surveillance to promptly identify and respond to potential resurgences. The observed trends are critical for healthcare resource planning, ensuring adequate staffing, vaccine stockpiling, and public health interventions are aligned with the ILI activity levels.
