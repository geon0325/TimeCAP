Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature, showing a cooling trend toward the middle of the period, followed by a significant increase, and then stabilizing towards the end. Humidity levels experienced a sharp decrease mid-day, which could be indicative of a dry air mass moving through the area, but levels increased again towards the evening, suggesting a return to more moist conditions. Air pressure saw some variability with a notable peak, potentially signaling a transient high-pressure system influencing the weather, which often correlates with clearer skies. Wind speeds were generally moderate but showed some variability, with periods of calmer conditions interspersed with gustier winds. The predominant wind direction was westerly, with some shifts, which is typical for the coastal climate of San Francisco and can influence fog and coastal weather patterns.
