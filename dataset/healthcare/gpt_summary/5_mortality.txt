Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a gradual decline in the proportion of deaths due to Influenza or Pneumonia compared to total mortality, starting from a high of 8.53% and ending at 5.85%, which is below the average ratio of 7.84%. This trend indicates a drop in mortality from these causes relative to overall deaths. Despite fluctuations, the absolute number of deaths from both Influenza and Pneumonia also shows a downward trend, with Influenza-related deaths decreasing from 419 to 15, and Pneumonia-related deaths declining from 4448 to 2982 over the 20-week period. The total number of deaths varied week to week but did not exhibit a strong trend in either direction, suggesting that the reductions in Influenza or Pneumonia mortality are not due to a general decrease in overall deaths. These findings could suggest an improvement in the prevention, management, or treatment of Influenza and Pneumonia, but they also necessitate continued public health monitoring to determine if this trend persists and to identify potential underlying causes for these changes.
