Over the last 24 hours in Houston, the temperature experienced a noticeable fluctuation, reaching its peak during the afternoon and dropping to its lowest point in the early morning hours, which is typical of the diurnal temperature cycle. Humidity levels varied significantly, with a general increase during the night, indicative of less atmospheric mixing and a common rise in relative humidity due to lower temperatures. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight increase around midday, which could suggest stable weather conditions persisting during that period. Wind speeds were mostly light and variable, with the calmest conditions occurring during the nighttime, a pattern that can be associated with the settling of the atmosphere. The wind direction was predominantly from the southeast, with some shifts, which is consistent with the region's prevailing winds and could contribute to the transport of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico into the area.
