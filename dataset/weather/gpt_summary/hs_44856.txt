Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have shown a gradual increase during the day, reaching a peak in the late afternoon before declining slightly at night. Humidity levels started relatively moderate but increased significantly, indicating potential early morning moisture, which then decreased towards the afternoon and evening, suggesting drier conditions. Air pressure has been on a slow but steady decline throughout the period, which could indicate an approaching weather system that may cause changes in the current weather pattern. Wind speeds have been mostly light to gentle, with occasional moderate gusts, and the wind direction has been variable, with a general tendency to shift, which might reflect the influence of local weather systems. Overall, the combination of declining air pressure and variable wind directions suggests that Houston may be experiencing a transition in weather conditions, with the potential for more dynamic weather in the near future.
