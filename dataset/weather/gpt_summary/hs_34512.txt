Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature, with the trend indicating a peak during the daytime and a gradual decrease through the night, typical of the diurnal cycle. The humidity levels have seen periods of high saturation, even reaching full saturation at one point, suggesting the possibility of fog or mist formation, especially during the early morning hours when temperatures were lower. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, indicating steady weather conditions without significant fronts passing through the area. Wind speeds varied, with an instance of a sharp increase that could have been associated with a transient weather event such as a gust front or a thunderstorm passage. The predominant wind direction was from the south to southeast, which is common for Houston and can be associated with warm, moist air being drawn in from the Gulf of Mexico.
