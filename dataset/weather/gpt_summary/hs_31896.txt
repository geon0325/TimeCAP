Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a gradual increase in temperature from early morning to afternoon, followed by a slight decrease towards the late evening, which is typical for a diurnal pattern. Humidity levels have shown significant fluctuations, with very high values indicating the possibility of fog or mist formation, especially when they reached saturation. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor variations, suggesting steady weather conditions without the immediate likelihood of significant weather fronts or storms. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, but there was an increase observed during the latter part of the period, which could contribute to cooler perceived temperatures and dispersion of any humidity or fog. The wind direction has been predominantly from the south to southeast, which is common for Houston and can bring in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, contributing to the observed higher humidity levels.
