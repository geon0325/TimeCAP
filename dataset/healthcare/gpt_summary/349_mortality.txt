Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates an upward trend in the mortality ratio of influenza and pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, with the ratio increasing from 6.09% to 8.23%, surpassing the average of 7.84%. Notably, there was a significant spike observed in the number of deaths from influenza, which more than fifteen-fold increased from 38 to 600, while pneumonia-related deaths also rose from 3412 to 4806. The highest weekly mortality ratio recorded was 9.15% in week 15, which signals a peak in the impact of these respiratory conditions. This trend suggests an increased burden on the healthcare system, potentially indicating a more severe influenza season or other contributing factors such as a possible concurrent outbreak. It is essential for healthcare providers and policymakers to closely monitor these trends and allocate resources appropriately to manage the rising impact of these illnesses on public health.
