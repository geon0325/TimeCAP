Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 experienced volatility with a general downward trend, decreasing from 3973.75 to 3764.79, which could indicate a bearish market sentiment. The VIX, or Volatility Index, showed increased fluctuations, peaking at 34.02, which aligns with the heightened uncertainty and risk in the stock market. In contrast, the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 displayed resilience towards the end, with the Nikkei recovering from its low to close at 26246.31 and the FTSE rebounding to 7152.10, suggesting some regional markets are weathering the volatility better than others. Gold Futures remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting it is being used as a safe haven during this period of market uncertainty. The exchange rates showed a weakening US dollar against the Japanese Yen and a slight strengthening against the Euro and the Chinese Yuan, which could impact multinational trade balances and investment flows.
