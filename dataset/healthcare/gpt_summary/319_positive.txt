Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable upward trend in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the ratio of positive specimens increasing from 1.00% to 8.55%. The number of specimens tested peaked at week 7 with 150,872 tests, then gradually decreased to 66,402 tests by week 20. Influenza A has been the predominant strain throughout the period, with its positivity rate growing from 0.94% to 8.38%, while Influenza B has remained comparatively low, peaking at 0.17% in the final week. The surge in Influenza A positive cases, particularly from week 15 to week 20, where the positivity rate for Influenza A jumped from 4.60% to 8.38%, suggests an increasing burden on the healthcare system. The current trend highlights the need for enhanced influenza surveillance, vaccination efforts, and preparedness for a potential influx of patients requiring medical care.
