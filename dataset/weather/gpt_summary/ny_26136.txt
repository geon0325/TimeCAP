Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a slight decrease in temperature, indicating a mild cooling trend. Humidity levels varied significantly, with a notable peak correlating with the lowest temperatures, which suggests the presence of early morning dew or fog that later dissipated. Air pressure remained relatively stable, maintaining values that are typical for fair weather conditions, with only minor fluctuations that are unlikely to have a significant impact on the weather. Wind speeds were mostly gentle to moderate, with some variability, but no extreme gusts were recorded, suggesting a calm to breezy day without disruptive wind events. The wind direction was predominantly from the east, with some shifts, which may have influenced coastal conditions and could bring in moisture from the ocean, possibly affecting local weather patterns.
