Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature followed by a significant rise towards the end of the period, indicative of a typical diurnal cycle influenced by the coastal climate. Humidity levels fluctuated considerably, with a notable increase in the early hours, which could have led to early morning fog, a common occurrence in the region, before dropping off as the temperature rose. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight increase towards the end of the period, suggesting steady weather conditions that are likely to persist. Wind speeds varied moderately, with a couple of peaks that might have contributed to brisk conditions, especially by the bay. The wind direction was predominantly from the west-northwest, typical for San Francisco, shifting towards a more northerly direction at times, which can channel cooler air from the ocean across the city.
