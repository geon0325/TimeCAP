Over the past 20 market days, the S&P 500 has displayed volatility with an overall decline from 4431.85 to 4384.65, indicating a potential trend of investor uncertainty or market correction. The VIX, commonly known as the fear gauge, has shown elevated levels, peaking at 31.02, which aligns with the observed fluctuations in the S&P 500 and suggests that market volatility has been higher than usual. International markets have also experienced volatility, with Japan's Nikkei 225 and the UK's FTSE 100 both showing fluctuations, though the FTSE 100 has seen a significant drop on the last reported day, which may reflect heightened market sensitivity to global economic factors. Gold Futures have risen from 1784.90 to 1886.50, indicating a flight to safety by investors during times of market stress. Lastly, the foreign exchange rates have been relatively stable, with minor depreciations in the EUR/USD and USD/JPY pairs, while the USD/CNY has remained fairly steady, suggesting that currency markets have not reacted as sharply to the equity and commodity market movements during this period.
