Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable trend of increasing influenza-like illness (ILI) rates, surpassing the baseline threshold of 2.9% and peaking in the recent weeks. This upward trend is particularly pronounced in the younger age groups, with school-aged children (5-24 years) showing the most significant rise, indicating a potential for increased transmission within school settings and among families. While all age groups have experienced increases in ILI rates, the elderly (65 years and older) have the lowest incidence, which may reflect higher vaccination rates or possibly less exposure. Despite this, the healthcare system should prepare for increased demand for medical services, including diagnostics, treatment for complications, and potential hospitalizations, especially among the working-age population (25-49 years) who have shown a substantial increase in ILI rates. Public health interventions such as vaccination campaigns, awareness programs, and school-based initiatives may be critical in mitigating the spread of illness as we move forward.
