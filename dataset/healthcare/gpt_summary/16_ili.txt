Over the last 20 weeks, the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data indicate a consistent trend below the baseline ratio that would signal a widespread influenza outbreak. The patient count for ILI across all age groups has generally decreased over time, with the most substantial reductions observed in the youngest (0-4) and school-age (5-24) cohorts. Despite minor fluctuations, the ratio of ILI patients percentage has remained well under the threshold, suggesting that the influenza activity is lower than the level of concern. There was a slight uptick in ILI cases in the most recent weeks across all age categories, which warrants close monitoring to detect any early signs of a potential increase in influenza spread. The healthcare system may not be currently strained by ILI, but vigilant surveillance is necessary to quickly respond to any changes in the trend.
