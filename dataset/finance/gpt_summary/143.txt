Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with a decline from 3020.97 to 2847.11, indicating a bearish trend and potential investor uncertainty. The VIX, or Volatility Index, has generally increased from 12.83 to 19.87, which corresponds with the observed market volatility and suggests increased market fear. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 have also reflected this downward trend in equities, with the Nikkei dropping from 21616.80 to 20710.91 and the FTSE 100 from 7686.60 to 7095.00, reinforcing the global nature of the current market uncertainties.

Gold futures have risen from 1419.60 to 1526.60, which is typical during times of market stress as investors seek safe-haven assets. The exchange rates have seen the USD strengthening against the Yen and the Yuan but remaining relatively stable against the Euro, which may suggest a flight to the safety of the U.S. dollar amidst international trade tensions and global economic concerns.
