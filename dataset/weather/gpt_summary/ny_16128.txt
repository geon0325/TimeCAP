Over the past 24 hours in New York City, temperatures exhibited a warming trend, peaking in the late afternoon before gradually cooling towards the evening. Relative humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with a notable increase during the nighttime and early morning hours, which could have led to a feeling of mugginess or discomfort. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day but showed a slight decrease in the late evening, which might suggest the approach of a minor weather system or front. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate and variable in direction, indicating no strong weather systems influencing the area at the time. The variability in wind direction, especially from northerly to southerly, may have contributed to the observed temperature fluctuations and humidity levels experienced throughout the day.
