Over the past day in Houston, temperatures experienced a slight fluctuation, with a general warming trend that peaked in the late afternoon before a modest decrease as the evening approached. Humidity levels also showed variability, reaching saturation in the early morning hours, which could have led to morning fog or dew, and then decreasing towards the afternoon, likely contributing to more comfortable conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, indicating a period of steady weather without the immediate likelihood of significant weather changes. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate but increased towards the end of the period, which could disperse humidity and lead to clearer skies. The wind direction was predominantly from the south, shifting slightly throughout the day, which is typical for Houston and can bring in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, affecting the local humidity and temperature.
