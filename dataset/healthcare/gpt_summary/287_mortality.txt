Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in the number of deaths attributed to influenza and pneumonia when compared to the total number of deaths, with the ratio of mortality from these causes experiencing a significant peak in weeks 14 and 15, reaching 14.15% and 13.15% respectively, which are substantially higher than the 20-week average of 7.84%. This peak coincides with a spike in total mortality, suggesting a possible outbreak or increased virulence during that period. The mortality ratio then shows a declining trend, albeit it remains above the average in the subsequent weeks, indicating that the situation may be stabilizing but still requires attention. The number of deaths specifically from influenza remains relatively low and stable throughout the period, which implies that pneumonia is the predominant contributor to the increased mortality ratio during the observed weeks. Healthcare providers and policymakers should remain vigilant and possibly investigate the causes of the spike, while also ensuring that resources are adequately allocated to manage and prevent pneumonia cases, especially during times when higher mortality rates are observed.
