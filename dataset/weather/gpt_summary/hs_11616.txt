Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has shown a gradual upward trend, indicating a warming pattern that may affect the comfort levels and energy usage in the region. Relative humidity has decreased as the temperature rose, suggesting drier air that could impact local vegetation and the comfort of residents. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively high and stable throughout the period, with a slight increase midday, which is indicative of fair weather conditions persisting. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with a peak during the morning hours, which could have dispersed pollutants and provided some relief from the heat. The wind direction was primarily from the north, shifting towards the southeast later in the period, which may have implications for air quality and temperature as different air masses move into the area.
