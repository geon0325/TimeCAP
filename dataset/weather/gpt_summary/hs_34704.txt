Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a notable fluctuation in temperature with a general trend of warming during the day before cooling again. Humidity levels were exceptionally high, reaching saturation at several points, which could have led to foggy conditions and potentially impacted visibility. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, indicating a likelihood of consistent weather patterns without the immediate approach of significant fronts or storm systems. Wind speeds varied mildly, but there was a significant shift in wind direction, suggesting a change in weather systems affecting the area. The combination of high humidity and changing wind patterns may have implications for local weather conditions, including the possibility of precipitation or the development of localized weather phenomena.
