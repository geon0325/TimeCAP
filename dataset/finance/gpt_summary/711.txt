Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a general upward trend, starting at 4551.68 and closing at 4690.70, indicating a positive sentiment in the U.S. equity market. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, has fluctuated but ended slightly higher at 19.38, suggesting an increase in investor uncertainty or risk perception towards the end of the period. International markets have seen mixed movements with the Nikkei 225 showing relative stability with a slight upward trend and closing at the same level as the previous market day, and the FTSE 100 experiencing a gradual increase, indicating resilience in the UK market despite global uncertainties. Gold futures have seen a decrease from 1797.90 to 1783.50, which may imply a shift in investor preference towards riskier assets or a reduced demand for traditional safe havens. Exchange rates have revealed a weakening of the Euro and the Japanese Yen against the USD, with the EUR/USD moving from 1.16 to 1.12 and the USD/JPY increasing from 114.19 to 114.79, while the USD/CNY remained largely stable, which could indicate a strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the foreign exchange market.
