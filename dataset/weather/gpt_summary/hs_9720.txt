Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature displayed a typical diurnal pattern, starting with warmer conditions that gradually cooled to a minimum before rising again towards the end of the period. Humidity levels showed an inverse relationship with temperature, increasing as the temperature dropped and reaching peak levels during the coolest part of the day, suggesting potential for morning dew or fog formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase during the day, indicating steady weather conditions without significant frontal activity. Wind speeds were consistently light throughout the period, with no variation in speed, which could lead to stagnation of air and accumulation of pollutants in the absence of a dispersive mechanism. The wind direction was constant, suggesting a persistent weather pattern without any significant changes in the weather system affecting Houston during this period.
