The VIX, a measure of market volatility, has generally decreased from 17.01 to 16.17, aligning with the gains in the S&P 500 and indicating reduced investor anxiety. In contrast, Gold Futures dropped significantly from 1828.40 to 1750.40, reflecting a shift away from safe-haven assets, which may correlate with the positive sentiment in equity markets.
