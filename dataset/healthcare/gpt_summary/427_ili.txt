Over the last 20 weeks, the proportion of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases has consistently remained below the 2.9% threshold, suggesting a milder influenza season compared to the benchmark for severity. The highest ratio of ILI patients was observed in the first week at 2.44% and has since shown a general downward trend, reaching the lowest at 1.19% in week 18. All age groups experienced a decline in the number of ILI patients, with the 0-4 age group starting at 13,086 and decreasing to 5,812, and the 25-49 age group showing a reduction from 13,264 to 7,475. Notably, after week 16, there was a slight increase in ILI cases across all age groups, although the overall ratio of ILI cases continued to remain well below the benchmark. This trend indicates a reduced burden on the healthcare system from influenza, but the uptick in recent weeks may warrant closer monitoring to ensure healthcare preparedness for any potential increase in ILI cases.
