Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperature has exhibited a typical diurnal pattern, with a peak during the daytime and a gradual decrease through the night into the early morning hours. Humidity levels have fluctuated significantly, with notably high values during the night that suggest the presence of moisture, potentially leading to fog or dew formation, particularly when coupled with the cooler night temperatures. The air pressure has remained relatively stable and within the normal range, indicating a likelihood of steady weather conditions without the immediate approach of a significant weather system. Wind speeds have been consistently low, suggesting calm conditions without significant wind chill factor or disruptions due to gusty conditions. The wind direction has been predominantly from the northwest, which is common for the region, except for a brief shift to a southerly and northeasterly direction, which could bring slight changes in temperature and moisture levels.
