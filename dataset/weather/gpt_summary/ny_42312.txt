Over the past 24 hours in New York City, the temperature exhibited a warming trend, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before gradually declining as the evening approached. Humidity levels fluctuated, with a notable increase during the night, which may have contributed to a feeling of mugginess despite the subsequent decrease during the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, indicating a period of steady weather conditions without significant front movements or storm systems. Wind speeds were generally light and variable, with some calm conditions observed, which could have led to a build-up of urban heat and less dispersion of pollutants. The wind direction shifted significantly at various points, suggesting the presence of changing local wind patterns or the influence of larger weather systems in the vicinity.
