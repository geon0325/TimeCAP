Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, reaching a minimum in the early morning hours before rising again towards the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels showed significant variability, with a sharp increase during the night, indicative of potential early morning fog or dew, before decreasing as temperatures rose. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with a slight downward trend suggesting a potential change in weather patterns, such as the approach of a weather front. Wind speed varied modestly, with an increase towards the evening, which could contribute to a dispersal of humidity and any cloud cover. The wind direction was predominantly from the south, shifting slightly throughout the day, which is typical for Houston and could be associated with the transportation of warmer air masses from the Gulf of Mexico.
