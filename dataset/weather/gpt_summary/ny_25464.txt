Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before slowly declining towards the evening. Relative humidity levels were variable, with a significant spike to full saturation around dawn, which may have been associated with morning fog or dew, followed by a decrease during the day, indicating drier conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight fluctuating trend, suggesting steady weather patterns without the immediate approach of significant weather fronts. Wind speeds were generally light and variable, with a slight increase later in the day, which could contribute to a moderate wind chill effect as temperatures dropped. The wind direction shifted throughout the day, starting from easterly directions, moving to southerly and westerly, and eventually settling into a southeasterly flow, which could have influenced temperature and humidity variations.
