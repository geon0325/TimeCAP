Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable increase in the ratio of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, peaking at 26.27% in week 16 from a starting point of 0.48% in week 1, far exceeding the 20-week average of 6.26%. The bulk of positive cases are attributable to Influenza A, which at its peak accounted for 26.15% of specimens, compared to Influenza B's peak of 0.13%. While both strains have shown significant growth, Influenza A has been more prevalent and is the primary driver of the increased positive specimen ratio. However, the last four weeks have shown a decline in the percentage of positive specimens, indicating a potential downward trend in influenza cases. This fluctuation in influenza activity could impact healthcare resource allocation and underscores the importance of continued surveillance and vaccination efforts to manage the spread of influenza.
