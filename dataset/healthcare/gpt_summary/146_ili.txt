Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a significant increase in the percentage of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) patients across all age groups, surpassing the baseline indicator for a notable period. The increase was most pronounced in the age groups 5-24 and 25-49, where the number of ILI patients peaked substantially, suggesting possible widespread transmission in these demographics. The highest overall percentage of ILI patients was observed mid-time series, after which a gradual decline commenced, yet the latest figures still hover around the baseline, indicating continued public health relevance. The age group 65 or more consistently reported the lowest ILI figures, though they too showed a rise and fall pattern over the period. The persistent levels of ILI above the baseline for several weeks would have likely put a strain on healthcare resources, emphasizing the need for continued monitoring and possibly increased healthcare preparedness during peak times.
