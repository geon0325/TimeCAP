Over the last 20 weeks, there has been an observed fluctuation in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia relative to the total number of deaths, with a noted peak of 8.33% in week 5 significantly above the average of 7.84%. Despite this peak, the overall trend has shown a gradual decrease in this ratio, concluding at 6.76% in the final week, which is below the 20-week average. The total number of deaths peaked at week 4 with 59,505 deaths but has since shown a decreasing trend, ending at 55,477 deaths in the last week. The number of deaths from influenza spiked notably in week 5, aligning with the highest mortality ratio, but then followed a decreasing trend. Pneumonia deaths have also decreased over the period but remained a more significant contributor to the mortality ratio compared to influenza, suggesting a continued need for preventive healthcare measures and resource allocation for pneumonia management.
