Over the past 20 market days, the S&P 500 has experienced significant volatility, with a sharp decline followed by a partial recovery, indicating a turbulent period for the US equity market. The VIX, or Volatility Index, has remained elevated but has shown a slight decreasing trend, suggesting that market uncertainty, while still high, is gradually subsiding. International markets reflected similar volatility, with Japan's Nikkei 225 and the UK's FTSE 100 both experiencing substantial drops before partially rebounding, highlighting global economic instability.

Gold Futures, traditionally seen as a safe-haven asset, increased in value following initial declines, which is consistent with investors seeking stability amid market turmoil. Both crude oil futures and exchange rates have faced exceptional volatility, with oil prices plummeting to historic lows due to a price war and demand shock, and currency exchange rates, particularly the USD against major currencies, fluctuating as central banks around the world take unprecedented measures to stabilize the economy.
