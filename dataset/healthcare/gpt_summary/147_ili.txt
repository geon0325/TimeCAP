Over the last 20 weeks, the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data indicates a significant rise in the ratio of ILI patients, surpassing the baseline level, with the peak ratios being observed in the mid-period of the analysis. Notably, the age group of 5-24 years consistently showed the highest number of ILI cases among all age groups, with a sharp increase that correlates with the overall peak in ILI ratios. The data suggests an easing trend towards the end of the period, with ratios declining yet still hovering near the baseline, implying a persistent presence of ILI in the population. Despite the decrease in the overall number of patients in the most recent weeks, the healthcare system may still experience a strain due to the high proportion of ILI cases among the overall patient population. The age-specific ILI trends underscore the need for targeted public health interventions and resource allocation, particularly in age groups that showed higher ILI incidence.
