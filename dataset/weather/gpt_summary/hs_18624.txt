Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual decline in temperature, reaching its lowest point during the early morning hours before a slight rebound. Concurrently, humidity levels remained exceptionally high throughout the period, only beginning to decrease in the later hours, which suggests a potential for fog development or misty conditions, particularly when the temperature was at its lowest. Air pressure showed a consistent increase, indicating a strengthening high-pressure system that could lead to clearer skies and stable weather conditions. Wind speeds were moderate and steady, with very little fluctuation, while wind direction was predominantly from the north-northwest, which is typical for cooler and drier air masses affecting the area. Overall, the combination of rising pressure, decreasing humidity, and consistent northerly winds points toward a trend of cooler, drier, and more stable weather for Houston in the near term.
