Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths has been consistently below the average ratio of 7.84%, with the highest reported ratio being 6.58% in week 19 and the lowest at 5.81% in week 5. Despite fluctuations, there has been a slight upward trend in the ratio starting from week 15, with an increase from 6.18% to a peak of 6.58%, before settling at 6.42% in the latest week. The absolute number of deaths from Influenza has decreased significantly, reaching a low of 15 deaths in week 19 from a high of 106 in week 3, which could indicate a decline in Influenza activity or effective management strategies. However, deaths from Pneumonia have shown more stability, with week 20 reporting 3733 deaths, only marginally lower than the peak of 3841 in week 19. It is important for healthcare systems to monitor these trends closely, as even slight increases in mortality ratios could indicate rising public health challenges, especially in the context of seasonal variability or emerging health threats.
