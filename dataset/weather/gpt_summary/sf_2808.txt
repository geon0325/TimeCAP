Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature, maintaining a relatively cool climate throughout the period. Humidity levels have shown a decreasing trend, which could indicate drier air moving into the area. Air pressure saw a significant drop early in the period but then stabilized, suggesting a transient weather system might have passed through. Wind speeds have generally increased, with the most substantial acceleration in the latter part of the period, which could lead to choppier conditions on the bay and higher wind chill factors. The wind direction has been predominantly westerly, which is typical for San Francisco and may have contributed to the coastal city's moderate temperatures.
