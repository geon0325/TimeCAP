Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature exhibited a mild fluctuation, with a general trend of cooling during the earlier hours followed by a gradual increase towards the afternoon, reaching a peak before slightly cooling again. Humidity levels varied significantly, with the highest values occurring during the cooler early hours, suggesting the presence of morning dew or fog, and lower values during the warmer periods of the day, which is typical due to the inverse relationship between temperature and humidity. Air pressure has been on a slow decline throughout the period, indicating a potential change in weather patterns that could lead to less stable conditions. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with a couple of instances of calm conditions, and they varied without a clear trend, which might not have a significant impact on dispersing atmospheric pollutants, hence affecting air quality. The wind direction was predominantly from the south to the southeast, which is common for Houston and may bring moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, possibly contributing to higher humidity levels observed.
