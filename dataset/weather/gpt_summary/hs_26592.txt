Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a noticeable diurnal temperature variation with a significant rise during the day before dropping again towards the early hours. Humidity levels saw an inverse relationship with temperature, peaking at times of lower temperatures and reaching saturation during the coolest hours, indicative of possible mist or fog formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, suggesting steady weather conditions without the immediate influence of strong weather systems. Wind speeds were generally light and variable, but there was an increase in wind speed concurrent with the highest temperatures, which could have contributed to the dispersion of humidity. The wind direction varied widely, indicating the presence of shifting weather patterns or localized influences affecting wind flow.
