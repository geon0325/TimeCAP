Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a noticeable drop in temperature, transitioning from warmer conditions to significantly cooler temperatures by the end of the period. Humidity levels remained high throughout, with peaks at complete saturation, suggesting a very moist air mass over the area, which could have led to instances of fog or mist. Atmospheric pressure showed a gradual increase, indicative of a developing high-pressure system that could lead to more stable weather conditions. Wind speeds varied, with a notable increase during one period, potentially leading to brisk conditions that could have amplified the cool feel of the lower temperatures. Wind direction was primarily from the south and southeast but shifted significantly to come from the north and northwest, signaling a change in the weather pattern, possibly a frontal passage.
