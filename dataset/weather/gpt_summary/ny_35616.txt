Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature with a general cooling trend towards the latter part of the period. Humidity levels remained high throughout the day, increasing during the night, which could contribute to a damp or muggy feeling in the air. Atmospheric pressure showed a gradual and consistent increase, indicating stable weather conditions and potentially clearer skies. Wind speeds were relatively constant, with a minor decrease observed mid-period, but overall maintained a moderate pace. The wind direction was predominantly from the northwest, with a slight shift towards the north-northwest later on, which is typical for bringing cooler air into the region.
