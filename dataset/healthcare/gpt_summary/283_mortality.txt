Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia to total deaths has mostly been below the average of 7.84%, fluctuating between 6.08% and 6.58% for the first 17 weeks. However, there was a significant spike in the last three weeks with ratios of 14.15%, 13.15%, and 12.35%, well above the average. The sharp increase coincides with an absolute rise in deaths from pneumonia during these weeks, peaking at 9741 deaths in week 18â€”far exceeding the weekly range of 3508 to 3816 observed earlier. The total number of deaths also saw a notable increase in the same period, reaching a peak in week 18 with 68969 deaths. This recent surge in mortality due to Influenza or Pneumonia could indicate an outbreak or a seasonal spike, necessitating closer monitoring and potentially increased healthcare resources to manage the situation.
