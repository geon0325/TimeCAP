Over the last 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have exhibited a mild fluctuation with a general cooling trend during the early morning hours followed by a gradual rise throughout the day. Humidity levels were relatively high, remaining mostly elevated which could indicate the presence of moisture-laden air, potentially leading to a feeling of mugginess or the chance of fog, especially during nighttime and early morning. Air pressure remained remarkably steady, suggesting stable weather conditions without significant fronts or systems passing through the area. Wind speeds were light to moderate and increased towards the end of the period, which could help disperse any fog or low-lying clouds that may have formed due to high humidity. The wind direction was predominantly from the west to the northwest, which is typical for San Francisco, possibly bringing in cool ocean air and affecting coastal temperatures.
