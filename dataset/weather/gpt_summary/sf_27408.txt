Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have experienced a modest fluctuation, with a general cooling trend during the early hours, followed by a warming trend towards the latter part of the period. Humidity levels have shown variability, with a noticeable increase during the nighttime hours, which is typical due to cooler temperatures and could lead to morning fog in the region. Air pressure readings have been relatively stable, but there have been some fluctuations which indicate the presence of varying weather systems moving through the area. Wind speeds have been moderate with some hours experiencing higher gusts, and the wind direction has shifted significantly, suggesting the passage of a frontal system. This combination of factors, including variable winds, shifting air pressure, and fluctuating humidity, points towards dynamic weather conditions which could result in changing skies and potential for varied weather patterns in the short term.
