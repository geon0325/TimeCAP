Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a general decrease in the total number of deaths, with a marked dip around weeks 8 and 9. The number of deaths from influenza started at a lower point, increased slightly towards the end, suggesting a potential rise in influenza cases or mortality. Deaths from pneumonia showed a more consistent pattern but also increased towards the end of the 20-week period. The ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia to the total number of deaths fluctuated but remained below the average of 7.84%, peaking at 7.13% in the last week. This data indicates a relative stability in the proportion of deaths from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to total deaths but warrants monitoring for potential increases in respiratory illness-related mortality.
