Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia to total deaths has shown a general declining trend, with the highest reported ratio of 8.95% in the first week and a decrease to 6.12% by the 20th week, indicating a potential improvement in managing these illnesses or a relative increase in other causes of death. Despite fluctuations, the absolute number of deaths attributed to Influenza or Pneumonia has decreased over time, from a combined total of 6069 deaths in the initial week to 3574 in the final week assessed. However, this trend does not align with the total number of deaths, which after a significant decrease, increased in the last four weeks, suggesting that other factors may be influencing overall mortality. The lowest ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia to total deaths occurred in week 16, at 5.70%, coinciding with the lowest total number of deaths within the period, which could indicate seasonal variations or effective public health interventions during that period. The healthcare system may need to investigate the underlying causes of the recent rise in overall mortality and continue monitoring trends in Influenza and Pneumonia-related deaths to allocate resources effectively and prepare for potential future increases.
