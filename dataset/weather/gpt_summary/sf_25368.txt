Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a moderate fluctuation in temperature with a warming trend during the day and cooling towards the late evening. Humidity levels showed variability with a noticeable drop in the afternoon, suggesting the possibility of drier conditions but followed by a significant rise towards the night, indicating increased moisture in the air. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable throughout most of the day, with a slight increase in the afternoon, maintaining steady weather conditions before a notable decrease late at night. Wind speeds varied from calm to moderate, with the highest speeds observed in the late evening, which could contribute to a wind chill effect, making it feel cooler than the actual temperature. The wind direction was predominantly from the northwest, shifting to due west at times, which is typical for the region and could lead to the advection of coastal marine air into the city, affecting local weather patterns.
