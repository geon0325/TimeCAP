Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a significant upward trend in the number of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases across all age groups, with the most pronounced increases observed in the 5-24 and 25-49 age brackets. The ratio of ILI patients has steadily risen, surpassing the baseline level of 2.9% around the midpoint of the observed period and continuing to escalate to nearly triple the baseline by the end of the period. This surge suggests a growing burden on the healthcare system, particularly in outpatient services and potential hospital resources due to increased ILI cases. The consistent rise in ILI rates across all age groups, especially among school-aged children and working-age adults, may also indicate widespread community transmission and could have implications for public health interventions, including flu vaccination campaigns and resource allocation. The data underscores the need for healthcare providers and public health officials to monitor ILI trends closely and prepare for heightened healthcare demands, especially in the upcoming weeks.
