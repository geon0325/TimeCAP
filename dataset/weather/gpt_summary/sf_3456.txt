Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a gradual increase in temperature with a slight dip in the early morning hours, following a more typical diurnal pattern. Humidity levels saw fluctuations, peaking during the night and early morning hours, which is common as temperatures drop, but then decreased significantly towards the afternoon, likely due to rising temperatures and perhaps changes in local atmospheric conditions. Air pressure has been steadily increasing throughout the period, indicating a potential buildup of a high-pressure system that could lead to settled and clear weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally low, with a period of calm conditions around sunrise, but there was an increase in wind activity later in the day, which could contribute to changes in temperature and humidity. The wind direction was predominantly from the west, with some variability, which is characteristic of the coastal weather patterns influenced by the Pacific Ocean.
