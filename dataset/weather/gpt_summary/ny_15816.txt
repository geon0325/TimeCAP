Over the last 24 hours in New York City, the temperature experienced a significant diurnal variation, peaking during the afternoon hours and gradually declining towards the evening, indicative of normal daily temperature cycles. Humidity levels fluctuated, reaching their highest points during the early morning hours, which is typical due to the cooling temperatures and potential for dew formation. Air pressure showed a steady decreasing trend throughout the day, which could suggest the approach of a weather system that may lead to changing weather conditions, such as increased chances of precipitation. Wind speeds were mostly moderate but showed signs of increasing towards the end of the 24-hour period, possibly signaling an incoming front or weather disturbance. Wind direction primarily varied between south and southwest, suggesting that the air mass over the city was generally coming from those directions, which often brings warmer and more humid conditions to the area.
