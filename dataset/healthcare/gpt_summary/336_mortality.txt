Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a variable but generally increasing trend in the mortality ratio of Influenza or Pneumonia to the total number of deaths, starting from 5.30% and peaking at 6.47% in the second to last week, before a slight decrease to 6.27% in the most recent week. The total number of deaths has fluctuated, with a noticeable increase in the later weeks, reaching up to 60,078 deaths in week 19 from a starting point of 56,273 deaths. Notably, deaths from Influenza have shown a sharp increase in the last week, jumping from 57 to 96, which is a significant rise compared to the stable low figures observed in the preceding weeks. Pneumonia-related deaths have also followed an upward trend, with week 20 showing a high of 3,665 deaths, compared to 2,953 deaths in week 1. This overall increase in the ratio of influenza and pneumonia-related mortality may indicate a growing burden on healthcare resources and could necessitate enhanced public health interventions to manage the spread and treatment of these respiratory illnesses.
