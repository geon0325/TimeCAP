Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a moderate decrease in temperature, which started relatively warm but trended downwards, reaching its lowest point during the early hours of the morning before rising again. Humidity levels were high throughout the period, peaking at night and early morning, which could have caused a feeling of mugginess, especially when temperatures were higher during the day. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight dip later in the period, suggesting stable weather conditions but with a potential for change following the pressure decrease. Wind speeds were generally light, with little variation, indicating a calm period; however, there was an uptick in wind speed towards the end of the 24-hour period. Wind direction varied significantly, with shifts from northwesterly to northeasterly and even southerly directions at times, which may have contributed to changes in temperature and humidity levels experienced.
