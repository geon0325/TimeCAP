Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual decline in temperature, which is typical of the coastal climate influenced by the cold ocean currents. Humidity levels have shown significant fluctuation, with a notable decrease during midday hours, likely due to the increase in temperature and wind activity. Air pressure has been relatively stable with a slight increase towards the middle of the day, suggesting a stable weather pattern without the presence of significant frontal systems. Wind speeds have been mostly light to moderate, with a slight increase during the day, which could contribute to the dispersal of any coastal fog that is common in the area. The wind direction has been variable, but predominantly from the northwest, which is characteristic of the prevailing winds in this region and could lead to cooler and clearer conditions along the coast.
