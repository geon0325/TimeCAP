Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in the mortality rate from Influenza or Pneumonia relative to total deaths, with a significant peak observed between weeks 7 and 10, where the rate exceeded the 20-week average of 7.84%. In particular, weeks 9 and 10 saw exceptionally high mortality rates at 15.78% and 15.21%, respectively, coinciding with the highest absolute numbers of deaths recorded. Following this peak, there has been a general downward trend in both the number of deaths from Influenza or Pneumonia and their proportion to total deaths, with the latest reported ratio at 7.64%, which is slightly below the 20-week average. The decrease in the number of deaths from Influenza and particularly from Pneumonia, which fell from a high of 11,988 in week 8 to 4,559 in week 20, suggests a potential easing of the burden on healthcare resources dedicated to these conditions. However, the healthcare system must remain vigilant as the latest weekâ€™s data shows a slight uptick in the mortality ratio, indicating possible variability in the impact of these respiratory conditions.
