Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable trend of increasing temperature reaching a peak in the late afternoon before gradually declining. Relative humidity followed an inverse pattern, with a spike during the early morning hours, indicative of possible early morning fog, then decreasing as temperatures rose throughout the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight overall decrease, suggesting that the current weather conditions could remain consistent in the short term. Wind speeds were generally light with some calm periods, and variable wind directions were observed, which could lead to unpredictable weather patterns and localized changes in weather conditions. The combination of rising temperatures and decreasing humidity during the day suggests typical weather patterns for the region without any immediate indication of severe weather events.
