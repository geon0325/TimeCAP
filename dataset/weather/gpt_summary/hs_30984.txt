Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, indicating a warming trend with the day likely reaching its peak temperature in the late afternoon. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, starting off relatively high, dropping midday, and then varying somewhat erratically, which could have affected the comfort levels throughout the day. Air pressure has been decreasing slightly, which might suggest an approaching weather system that could lead to changes in the current weather pattern. Wind speeds remained generally low but picked up slightly towards the end of the period, with wind direction showing a degree of variability, shifting primarily between northerly and easterly directions. The combination of these factors suggests a relatively stable weather pattern with some potential for change due to the slight decrease in air pressure and the variability in humidity and wind direction.
