Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 showed slight volatility, with a general downward trend closing lower at 4464.05 from an initial 4522.79, which could indicate a cautious or bearish sentiment among investors. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, fluctuated moderately between 13.30 and 17.10, ending lower at 14.84, suggesting that while there have been some uncertainties, overall market fear has not escalated significantly. International indices like the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 also experienced general declines, with the Nikkei closing flat after some recovery, and the FTSE 100 showing a marked decrease from 7406.40 to 7524.20, potentially reflecting broader global market concerns. Gold Futures, traditionally a safe-haven asset, saw a minor downtrend from 1952.40 to 1912.90, indicating that investors might not be heavily resorting to safe-haven assets yet. The exchange rates for EUR/USD and USD/CNY remained relatively stable with slight depreciation in the Euro and Chinese Yuan against the Dollar, while the USD/JPY showed a clear appreciation of the dollar from 138.68 to 144.85, which may suggest a flight to safety into the dollar, or expectations of diverging monetary policies among these economies.
