Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual increase in temperature, peaking during the later hours before a slight decrease towards the end of the period. Humidity levels were high throughout, reaching full saturation in the early morning, indicating the potential for fog or precipitation. The air pressure showed significant variability, with a notable increase mid-period, which could be associated with the passage of a weather front, followed by a decrease that could signal a return to less stable conditions. Wind speeds were mostly moderate but showed some increase in the last quarter of the period, suggesting that a weather system might be moving in or out of the area. Wind direction was predominantly from the south-southeast but shifted towards a more southerly direction later on, generally consistent with warm air being drawn up from the Gulf of Mexico.
