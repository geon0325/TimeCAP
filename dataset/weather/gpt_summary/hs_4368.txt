Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, indicating a warming trend moving through the day and into the evening. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuation, with periods of complete saturation followed by a noticeable drop, suggesting the presence of moisture that could lead to early morning fog or dew, followed by drier conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight increase in the middle of the time series, which could be associated with the transient high-pressure system affecting the area. Wind speeds were generally light to calm, with occasional light breezes, and the wind direction varied widely throughout the day, indicating no dominant weather front. The combination of high humidity levels during certain hours and light winds might have contributed to a muggy feeling for residents, especially during times of peak temperatures.
