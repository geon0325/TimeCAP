Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia to total deaths has exhibited fluctuations but remained mostly below the 20-week average of 7.84%. The ratio peaked in week 1 at 8.33% and reached its lowest in week 20 at 6.17%, indicating a general downward trend throughout the period. Notably, the number of deaths attributed to influenza has significantly decreased from 671 in week 1 to 68 in week 20, suggesting a potential reduction in influenza transmission or effective control measures. Meanwhile, deaths from pneumonia have also declined but less sharply, from 4418 in week 1 to 3229 in week 20. These trends could signify a relative easing of healthcare system burdens related to these respiratory conditions but warrant continued surveillance for potential reversals or seasonal variations.
