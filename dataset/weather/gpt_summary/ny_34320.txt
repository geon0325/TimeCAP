Over the past 24 hours in New York City, there has been a slight decrease in temperature, suggesting a mild cooling trend. Humidity levels have fluctuated significantly, with periods of very high humidity that could have contributed to the feeling of mugginess or potential fog formation. Atmospheric pressure has remained relatively stable for much of the day, with a notable increase during the latter part of the period, which could indicate the arrival of a high-pressure system potentially leading to clearer skies. Wind speeds have been mostly light and variable, with a tendency for calm conditions that would not contribute significantly to wind chill. The wind direction has varied widely throughout the period, which might be indicative of a changing weather pattern or the influence of local geographical features on wind flow.
