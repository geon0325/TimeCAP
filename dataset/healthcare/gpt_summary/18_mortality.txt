Over the last 20 weeks, the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia to total deaths has consistently remained below the average of 7.84%, indicating a lower-than-average impact of these illnesses on overall mortality during this period. The highest weekly mortality ratio was reported at 6.28% in the first week, with a noticeable decline to the lowest value of 5.36% in week 17. Despite minor fluctuations, there is a general downward trend in both the absolute number of deaths from Influenza or Pneumonia and their proportional representation in total mortality. Total deaths peaked at week 2 with 52,480 cases, and the lowest was observed in week 11 with 49,362 cases, suggesting variations in overall mortality independent of Influenza or Pneumonia. This trend could indicate effective public health interventions against these respiratory diseases or a shift in the mortality burden towards other health issues.
