Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant upward trend in the percentage of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases among all patients, beginning below the benchmark of 2.9% and surging to a high of 7.37% in the most recent week. Particularly notable is the rapid increase in ILI cases among the age groups 0-4 and 5-24, with the latter group experiencing the most substantial rise from 8111 cases to 62925 cases. The age group 25-49 also showed a dramatic increase in ILI cases, potentially reflecting higher transmission rates or increased susceptibility within the working-age population. The consistent growth in ILI cases among older age groups (50-64 and 65 or more) is concerning due to the higher risks of complications in these demographics. This sustained increase in ILI incidence across all age groups suggests a strain on healthcare resources and underscores the need for enhanced public health interventions and preparedness to address the escalating ILI activity.
