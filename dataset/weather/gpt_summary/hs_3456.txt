Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have experienced a slight decrease during the early hours before stabilizing, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels have fluctuated, with notable increases during times coinciding with lower temperatures, which is expected as cooler air holds less moisture. Barometric pressure showed a gradual increasing trend throughout the period, which could suggest the approach or presence of a high-pressure system, generally associated with stable and fair weather conditions. Wind speeds varied, with periods of calm interspersed with occasional gusts; however, there was no consistent pattern indicating a dominant weather front. Wind direction was predominantly from the north to northeast, but with some variability, suggesting that winds were not associated with a single weather system.
