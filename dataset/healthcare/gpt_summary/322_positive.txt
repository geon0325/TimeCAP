Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a fluctuating trend in the rate of positive influenza specimens with an initial increase followed by a decrease and then a second rise. Despite fluctuations, there is an overall upward trend in the ratio of positive specimens for Influenza A, peaking at 9.85% in week 19, while Influenza B remains relatively stable and low, with a minor peak at 0.17% in week 17. The ratio of positive specimens hit its highest point at 9.89% in week 19, significantly above the 20-week average of 6.26%. This suggests an increasing prevalence of Influenza A that could strain healthcare resources, necessitate increased surveillance, and potentially impact public health interventions. The recent decline to 8.84% in week 20 may indicate the beginning of a downward trend, but continuous monitoring is essential to confirm this pattern and respond accordingly.
