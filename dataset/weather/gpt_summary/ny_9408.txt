Over the last 24 hours, New York City has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperatures, maintaining a trend that suggests a relatively cool and stable weather pattern. Humidity levels remained high throughout the period, indicating a persistent dampness in the air that could contribute to a feeling of chilliness despite actual temperatures. The air pressure stayed significantly above average, suggesting the presence of a high-pressure system that is likely to be associated with clearer skies and calmer weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with minimal variation, which would not have contributed significantly to any perceived temperature changes. The wind direction varied across a wide range, including shifts from southerly to northerly directions, which may have influenced the slight temperature variations observed.
