Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a significant uptrend in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the average ratio of positive specimens more than tripling from initial 1.92% to 19.03% in the final week. Influenza A has been the more prevalent strain throughout the period, peaking at 20.21% positivity rate in week 15 before dropping to 10.37% by week 20, while Influenza B showed a slower but steady increase, ending at an 8.66% positivity rate. Notably, there was a substantial jump in the number of specimens tested from week 7 onward, coinciding with a steep rise in positive detections for both Influenza A and B, suggesting a possible outbreak period. The peak positivity rates for both strains in week 15 coincide with the highest number of tests conducted, indicating that the healthcare system might have been under significant strain during this period. Given the growing trend of positive cases and the stress on testing capabilities, healthcare facilities may need to bolster their resources to manage potential increases in influenza-related hospitalizations and outpatient visits.
