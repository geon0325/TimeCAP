Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has experienced volatility with a general downward trend, reflected by a decrease from 4682.80 to 4668.97, despite intermittent recoveries. This is mirrored by an elevated VIX, which spiked as high as 31.12, suggesting increased market uncertainty and risk aversion among investors. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 also faced declines, with the Nikkei dropping from 29776.80 to 28640.49, and the FTSE 100 falling from 7351.90 to 7231.40, indicating a broader sentiment of caution in global markets. Commodity markets saw Gold Futures fluctuating but ultimately increasing marginally from 1866.10 to 1786.30, hinting at a flight to safe-haven assets, while Crude Oil Futures declined significantly from 80.88 to 71.29, which may suggest concerns over future economic growth. Exchange rates remained relatively stable, with minor fluctuations in EUR/USD and USD/CNY, while USD/JPY experienced a slight decrease, suggesting that currency markets are less volatile in comparison to equity and commodities markets during the observed period.
