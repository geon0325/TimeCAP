Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced stable and relatively high temperatures, indicative of warm weather conditions. Humidity levels started high and increased slightly past midnight, suggesting a muggy atmosphere, which then decreased towards the latter part of the period, possibly providing some relief from the initial stuffiness. Air pressure has been on a gradual increase for most of the period, indicating stable weather conditions might be prevailing, before it saw a slight decline in the last few hours. Wind speeds were mostly light and variable, with a brief period of calm winds, and have slightly increased recently, which could lead to a minor cooling effect and dispersion of humidity. The wind direction has been variable, mainly from the southeast, but has shifted to a more easterly and then southeasterly direction in the last few hours, which may affect local weather patterns such as sea breeze influence on temperatures and humidity levels.
