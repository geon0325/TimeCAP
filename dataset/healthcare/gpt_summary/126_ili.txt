Over the last 20 weeks, the data reveals a gradual increase in the ratio of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) patients across all age groups, with the most significant uptick occurring in the most recent weeks. Despite this rise, the overall percentage of ILI patients has remained below the baseline threshold of 2.9% that would indicate a more severe influenza situation. The age group 0-4 years has consistently shown the highest number of ILI cases relative to their age-specific population, suggesting a higher vulnerability or exposure risk in this demographic. Notably, the total number of patients peaked significantly in the penultimate week, which, in the context of rising ILI ratios, could indicate an increased burden on healthcare resources. Healthcare providers should monitor these trends closely and be prepared for a potential surge in ILI cases, while public health messaging may need to focus on prevention strategies, particularly for the youngest age group.
