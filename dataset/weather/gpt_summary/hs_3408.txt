Over the last 24 hours in Houston, there has been a gradual decrease in temperature, which is typical as the city transitions from day to night, reaching its lowest point in the early hours of the morning before rising again. Relative humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with notable increases during the cooler night and early morning hours, suggesting the possibility of morning fog or dew. Air pressure showed a decreasing trend, which could indicate the approach of a weather system that may lead to changing weather conditions, such as increased cloudiness or precipitation. Wind speeds varied, with periods of calm and gustier conditions; the peak wind speed occurred in the afternoon, which could have dispersed any early humidity or fog. Wind direction was generally from the east to southeast but shifted to coming from the southwest later in the period, which might bring in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, affecting local weather patterns.
