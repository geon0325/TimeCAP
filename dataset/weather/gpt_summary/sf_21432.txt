Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a slight decrease in temperature followed by a gradual increase as the day progressed. Humidity levels were relatively high throughout the day, with only a minor decrease later on, indicating a persistent amount of moisture in the air. The air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight downward trend towards the end of the period, which could suggest an approaching change in weather patterns. Wind speeds were consistently low, suggesting calm weather conditions, but a noticeable shift in wind direction occurred, starting from the west and gradually shifting to a more northerly direction. This shift in wind direction, coupled with the high humidity and slight decrease in pressure, could potentially lead to cooler and possibly foggier conditions, which is typical for San Francisco's microclimate.
