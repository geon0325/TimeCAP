Over the last 20 weeks, the data shows a gradual increase in the ratio of mortality due to Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, rising from 5.34% to 6.39%, which exceeds the average ratio of 7.84%. The total number of deaths fluctuated slightly but showed an overall increasing trend, starting at 51,397 and reaching 56,387 by the end of the period. Deaths from pneumonia consistently outnumbered those from influenza, with pneumonia-related deaths increasing from 2,737 to 3,552, while influenza-related deaths rose more modestly from 6 to 51. This upward trajectory in the mortality ratio indicates a worsening impact of these respiratory conditions on the overall mortality. This trend could signal a growing burden on the healthcare system and may necessitate additional resources and preventative measures to manage and contain the spread of these illnesses.
