Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature, with a general trend of cooling overnight and warming during the day. Humidity levels were relatively high, especially during the early hours, but they experienced a significant decrease later on, which could have influenced the comfort levels in the area. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with minor variations that are typical in coastal areas and unlikely to cause significant changes in weather patterns. Wind speeds were mostly light, with occasional moderate gusts, suggesting a calm weather period without significant wind-related incidents. Wind direction varied, with winds predominantly coming from the west and southwest, which is common for the region and may have contributed to the transport of moist ocean air inland, affecting humidity levels.
