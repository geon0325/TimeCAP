Over the past 20 weeks, the data indicates a significant and sustained increase in the incidence of Influenza-like Illness (ILI), with the ratio of ILI patients peaking at 7.37% in week 6, far exceeding the benchmark threshold of 2.9%. The highest burden of ILI was observed among the 5-24 age group, suggesting a greater spread in settings frequented by children and young adults, such as schools and universities. Although there has been a recent decline in the percentage of ILI patients, the rates have consistently remained above the benchmark for 17 consecutive weeks, indicating a prolonged influenza season with potential stress on healthcare resources. The elderly population (age 65 or more) demonstrated the lowest number of ILI cases, yet they represent a high-risk group for complications, necessitating continued vigilance. The downward trend in the last four weeks suggests the wave may be receding, but healthcare systems should remain prepared for possible fluctuations and ensure vaccination and preventive measures are maintained, especially for high-risk groups.
