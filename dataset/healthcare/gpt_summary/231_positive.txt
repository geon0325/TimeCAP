Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a significant decrease in the ratio of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a peak of 15.81% in week 1 dropping to 0.15% by week 20. Influenza A has consistently been the predominant strain, although its incidence has also markedly decreased from 12.20% to 0.08% in the same period. The presence of Influenza B has diminished as well, falling from 3.61% to 0.07% over the 20 weeks. This downward trend suggests a decrease in influenza activity, which could indicate the end of the flu season or the effectiveness of public health interventions. However, continued surveillance is necessary to monitor for potential resurgences or new strains that could impact the healthcare system.
