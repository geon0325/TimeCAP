Over the last 20 weeks, the testing of respiratory specimens has revealed a fluctuating but overall stable prevalence of influenza, with an average positivity ratio slightly above the 20-week average at 6.26%. The number of specimens tested has decreased steadily from 86,376 to 30,857, which may indicate a seasonal decline in respiratory illnesses or changes in testing behaviors. Influenza A has consistently been more prevalent than Influenza B, with a recent peak positivity ratio of 0.88% in week 18, suggesting a possible late-season surge. Influenza B showed an earlier peak in positivity at week 11 with a ratio of 0.78%, but has since been declining. The healthcare system should remain vigilant for potential increases in Influenza A activity and ensure adequate resources for testing and treatment are available.
