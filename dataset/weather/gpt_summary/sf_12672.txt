Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, which reached its lowest point during the early morning hours before starting to rise again towards the afternoon. Humidity levels were relatively high throughout the day, with some fluctuations, indicating the presence of moisture in the air which could have contributed to a feeling of coolness, particularly when temperatures were at their lowest. Air pressure saw a steady increase over the period, suggesting the establishment of a high-pressure system that might lead to stable and clearer weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with some variability in intensity, but not significant enough to cause any severe weather events. Wind direction shifted several times, indicating the presence of varying weather systems passing through the area, but the predominance of winds from the west is typical for San Francisco's climate.
