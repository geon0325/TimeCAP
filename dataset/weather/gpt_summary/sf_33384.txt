Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual rise in temperature that peaked during the afternoon, followed by a modest cooling trend into the evening and nighttime. Humidity levels showed variations, generally higher during early morning and late evening hours, which is typical due to cooler temperatures, but there was a noticeable drop in the afternoon coinciding with the peak in temperatures. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, indicating no significant weather fronts moving through the area during this period. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with an unusual shift from northerly to a predominantly westerly direction and then to a northerly direction again, suggesting changing weather patterns that could influence fog and coastal conditions. The sporadic increase in wind speed during the evening could result in cooler and breezier conditions, especially near the coast and open areas.
