Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality rate from influenza and pneumonia has exhibited an increasing trend relative to the total number of deaths, starting at 14.57% and rising to 17.72%. This increase is significantly above the average ratio of 7.84%, suggesting a growing impact of these respiratory illnesses on overall mortality. There was a notable dip in both total deaths and deaths from pneumonia during the 8th week, which could be attributed to reporting variances or seasonal factors. The number of deaths from influenza remained relatively stable and low in comparison to pneumonia, indicating that pneumonia is the predominant contributor to the increased mortality ratio. The sustained upward trend in the mortality ratio from influenza and pneumonia requires attention from healthcare providers and could indicate the need for increased preventative measures, resource allocation, and public health interventions.
