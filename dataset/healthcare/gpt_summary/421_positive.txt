Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable upward trend in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the ratio peaking at 18.27% in week 9 before gradually declining to 11.94% by week 20. The prevalence of Influenza A has been higher than Influenza B throughout the period, although both subtypes exhibited a similar pattern of increase and subsequent decrease, with Influenza A peaking at 14.99% in week 9 and Influenza B peaking at 6.93% in week 16. The highest recorded weekly number of positive specimens was 22,812 (Influenza A: 22,817; Influenza B: 4,994) in week 9, coinciding with the peak of the positive specimen ratio. Despite a decrease in the percentage of positive specimens in recent weeks, the ratio remains above the 20-week average of 6.26%, indicating a sustained burden on the healthcare system. The data suggests that healthcare resources may have been significantly strained during the peak weeks, and continued vigilance will be necessary to manage the tail end of this influenza season.
