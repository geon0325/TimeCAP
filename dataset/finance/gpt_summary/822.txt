Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with a downward trend, starting at 4481.15 and ending at 4300.17, indicating market uncertainty. The VIX index has risen, peaking at 33.52, which coincides with the largest drops in the S&P 500, suggesting increased market fear and potential for further volatility. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 also experienced fluctuations, but the Nikkei closed flat over the period, whereas the FTSE 100 showed a net decrease, reflecting global market instability. Gold futures initially rose but ended slightly lower than the starting point, moving from 1918.40 to 1867.00, which may indicate a flight to safety among investors. The USD strengthened against both the EUR and JPY, but remained relatively steady against the CNY, which could have implications for international trade dynamics and import/export competitiveness.
