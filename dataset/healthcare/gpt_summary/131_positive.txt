Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a general decline in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for both Influenza A and B, indicating a downward trend in influenza activity. The initial weeks showed a higher positivity rate, with a peak of 11.25% in week 1, which gradually decreased to a low of 0.76% in week 19 before a slight increase to 1.34% in week 20. Positivity rates for Influenza A decreased from 3.60% in week 1 to 0.99% in week 20, while Influenza B showed a more significant drop from 7.65% to 0.35% in the same period. The reduction in influenza cases may alleviate some pressures on the healthcare system, potentially freeing up resources for other medical concerns. However, the slight increase in the overall positivity rate in the last recorded week (week 20) may suggest a need for continued surveillance to monitor for potential resurgences of influenza activity.
