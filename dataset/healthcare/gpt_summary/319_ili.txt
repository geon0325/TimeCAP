Over the last 20 weeks, the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) surveillance data indicates a steady increase in the proportion of ILI patients across all age groups, with the most pronounced rise observed in the youngest cohort (ages 0-4). Despite fluctuations, there is a noticeable trend where the ratio of ILI patients has incrementally risen, surpassing the baseline threshold of 2.9% in recent weeks. This upward trajectory suggests an expanding impact on healthcare resources, particularly in pediatric care, which may necessitate increased vigilance and potentially additional healthcare support. The data for older age groups, while showing a less steep increase, still indicates a growing burden of ILI that could lead to greater demands on healthcare services, especially with regards to individuals aged 25-49. Given these trends, healthcare systems should be prepared for ongoing and possibly heightened ILI activity, which could affect both outpatient services and hospital admissions.
