Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a general upward trend, moving from 3310.11 to 3629.65, indicating a positive market sentiment. Volatility, as measured by the VIX, has decreased from 37.59 to 21.25, suggesting that investors are currently experiencing less uncertainty. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 indices have also increased, which reflects a broader global market confidence. Commodity prices have seen mixed movements, with Gold Futures declining from 1865.60 to 1805.70, potentially due to investors shifting towards riskier assets, while Crude Oil Futures have risen from 36.17 to 45.71, which may signal a recovery in energy demand. Exchange rates have remained relatively stable with slight fluctuations, but the overall trend in EUR/USD and USD/CNY pairs indicates a marginally weaker dollar, whereas the USD/JYP pair indicates a slightly stronger dollar against the Japanese yen.
