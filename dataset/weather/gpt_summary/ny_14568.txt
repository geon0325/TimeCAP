Over the past 24 hours in New York City, temperatures have shown a gradual increase during the day, reaching a peak in the late afternoon before cooling slightly at night. Humidity levels have fluctuated considerably, with notable peaks suggesting the possibility of a more muggy feel at certain times, especially when temperatures were on the higher side. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight declining trend, indicating the potential for changes in weather patterns, such as the approach of a weather front. Wind speeds were generally light and variable, with a tendency for calm conditions, which may have contributed to a more stagnant air quality and less dispersion of pollutants. The wind direction varied significantly throughout the day, which is typical for an urban environment where buildings can influence wind flow patterns.
