Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable upward trend in the ratio of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a significant increase from 2.18% in week 1 to 5.30% in week 20. Influenza A is the predominant strain, with its positive specimen ratio more than tripling from 1.06% to 3.95%, while Influenza B also showed a considerable rise, but to a lesser extent, from 1.12% to 1.35%. The number of specimens tested has escalated by nearly 237%, from 7,071 in the first week to 23,794 in the last, suggesting an increased testing demand possibly due to rising influenza cases or heightened surveillance. The peak in positive cases for both Influenza A and B in the most recent week indicates that the influenza season may be reaching or at its peak intensity, which could strain healthcare resources due to a higher number of patients seeking care. Public health officials should consider these trends for resource allocation, vaccination campaigns, and public awareness efforts to mitigate the impact of influenza on the healthcare system.
