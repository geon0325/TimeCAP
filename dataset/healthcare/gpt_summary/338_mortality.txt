Over the last 20 weeks, there has been an upward trend in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, starting at 5.19% and increasing to 6.70%, which is below the average ratio of 7.84%. The total number of deaths fluctuated slightly but showed an overall increase, starting at 55,682 and rising to 61,033. Notably, deaths specifically attributable to influenza saw a significant rise in the latter weeks, jumping from 23 to 228, which could indicate a seasonal surge or an emerging influenza strain. Pneumonia-related deaths also increased over the period, from 2,868 to 3,859, suggesting a persistent prevalence of respiratory illnesses. This trend of rising mortality due to respiratory diseases may place additional strain on healthcare resources and highlights the need for enhanced public health measures, including vaccination and early treatment strategies.
