Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown an upward trend, increasing from 2989.69 to 3091.84, indicating a bullish sentiment among investors in the U.S. equity market. The VIX, which measures market volatility, has remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting that while there is some uncertainty, it is not at levels that would indicate a high degree of investor fear. International markets are also reflecting positive movements, with the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 experiencing overall gains, ending at 23520.01 and 7365.40, respectively, pointing towards investor confidence in global equity markets. Gold Futures have seen a slight downtrend, moving from 1488.00 to 1452.10, which could be due to investors shifting towards more risk-on assets as indicated by the rising equity indices. Currency markets have shown a mild appreciation of the USD against the EUR and JPY, while remaining mostly stable against the CNY, which may influence international trade dynamics and cross-border investment flows.
