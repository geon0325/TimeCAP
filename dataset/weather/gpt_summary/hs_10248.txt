Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable fluctuation in temperature, with a general trend of cooling overnight followed by a significant warming trend during the day. Humidity levels were consistently high, often reaching saturation, which could have led to foggy conditions, particularly when temperatures were lower. Air pressure showed a slight decreasing trend, which may indicate an approaching weather system with potential for changing weather conditions. Wind speeds remained mostly light with occasional moderate gusts, and the wind direction was variable, although there were periods of consistent direction which may have influenced local temperature and humidity patterns. Overall, the weather in Houston has been relatively stable, but the high humidity and low wind conditions could have implications for morning and nighttime visibility, as well as general comfort levels due to the mugginess.
