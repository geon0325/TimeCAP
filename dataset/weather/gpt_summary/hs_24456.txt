Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before slightly cooling down towards the evening. Humidity levels showed some fluctuations with very high humidity during the early hours, which decreased significantly as the temperature rose, indicating a typical diurnal pattern. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day with a slight increase around midday, which could suggest a stable weather pattern without the immediate presence of any significant frontal systems. Wind speeds were mostly light to gentle, with a slight increase in the evening hours, which is common as the land cools and the temperature gradient increases. The wind direction was predominantly from the south to south-east, which is typical for Houston and can contribute to warmer temperatures due to the flow of air from warmer regions.
