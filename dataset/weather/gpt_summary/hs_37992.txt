Over the course of the last 24 hours in Houston, the temperature exhibited a natural diurnal pattern, with a gradual increase during the daytime and a decrease at night, reaching its peak in the late afternoon. Relative humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with the highest values recorded during the night and early morning hours, suggesting the potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable with only slight variations, indicating a period of steady weather without the immediate presence of strong weather systems. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate and increased slightly towards the end of the period, while the wind direction was predominantly from the south to south-east, shifting more to the south-west later on, which is typical for the region and could contribute to bringing in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. These conditions are fairly characteristic for Houston's climate, with no immediate signs of severe weather on the horizon.
