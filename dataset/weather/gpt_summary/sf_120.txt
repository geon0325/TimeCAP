Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a general decrease in temperature, followed by a notable increase towards the latest hours, suggesting a typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuation, with a peak during the cooler early morning hours, indicative of possible fog or dew formation, and then a substantial decrease as temperatures rose, which is common as warmer air can hold more moisture. Air pressure experienced a slight dip but largely remained steady, suggesting stable weather conditions without the presence of any significant weather fronts or systems. Wind speeds varied, with calmer conditions around the early morning and an increase later in the day, and wind direction was predominantly westerly, which is typical for San Francisco due to its coastal location. The combination of these factors points to typical weather patterns for the region, with no immediate indications of severe weather conditions.
