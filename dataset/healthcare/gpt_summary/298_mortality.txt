Over the last 20 weeks, the proportion of deaths attributable to influenza or pneumonia has fluctuated significantly, with a noticeable peak in mortality ratio at 14.15% in week 3, which is considerably higher than the average ratio of 7.84%. This surge was primarily driven by a stark increase in pneumonia-related deaths, which spiked at 9741 in the same week. However, there was an unprecedented rise in influenza mortality in week 16, where deaths attributed to influenza alone soared to 887, nearly 44 times higher than the average of the preceding 15 weeks. Following this peak, the mortality ratio due to these illnesses has shown a downward trend, reaching 7.36% by week 20, which is below the average ratio. Such volatility in mortality rates, especially the sudden increase in influenza-related deaths, suggests an atypical event and underscores the need for vigilant surveillance and response strategies within the healthcare system.
