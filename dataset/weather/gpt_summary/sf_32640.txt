Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a steady increase in temperature which peaked during the late afternoon hours, before gradually cooling towards the early morning. Humidity levels showed a general decline throughout the day, with a significant drop observed in the evening which could be indicative of a dry air mass moving into the area. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable, suggesting that no significant weather fronts were passing through the region during this period. Wind speeds were generally low but saw a slight increase in the evening, with varying wind directions indicating no dominant weather pattern influencing the area. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and stable pressure points to stable weather conditions, but the evening's decrease in humidity and increased wind speed may result in cooler and drier conditions moving forward.
