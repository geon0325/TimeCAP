Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 showed resilience with a modest upward trend, rising from 3795.54 to 3916.38, indicating a positive sentiment among investors. The VIX, or Volatility Index, experienced a spike mid-period, reaching 37.21, which coincided with a drop in the S&P 500, but it has since stabilized around the low 20s, suggesting reduced market volatility. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 experienced volatility; the Nikkei 225 rose notably, indicating stronger performance in the Japanese market, while the FTSE 100 saw a slight decline, reflecting potential concerns in the UK market. Commodity prices such as Gold Futures and Crude Oil Futures exhibited fluctuations with gold decreasing from 1850.30 to 1824.90, possibly due to investors shifting towards riskier assets, while crude oil showed a consistent uptrend from 53.57 to 58.24, which could be indicative of expectations of economic recovery. Exchange rates remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting that currency markets are currently less volatile and maintaining equilibrium amid broader market movements.
