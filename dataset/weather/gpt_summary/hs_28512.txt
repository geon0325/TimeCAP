Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has shown a general upward trend, indicative of a warming pattern that peaked during the latter part of the day before experiencing a slight drop. Humidity levels have decreased significantly as the temperature rose, suggesting drier air moving into the area. Air pressure has seen some fluctuation but ended on a higher note, which could indicate stable weather conditions setting in. The wind speed remained relatively light to moderate throughout the period, with a slight increase in the later hours, while the wind direction has been predominantly northwesterly, shifting slightly towards the north-northeast as the day progressed.
