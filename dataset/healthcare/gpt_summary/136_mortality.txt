Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable upward trend in the ratio of mortality due to Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, increasing from 5.12% to 6.74%, and exceeding the average ratio of 7.84% in the final week. This rise corresponds with a significant increase in the number of deaths attributed to influenza, which surged from 8 to 141. Simultaneously, deaths from pneumonia also showed an upward trajectory, from 2601 to 3636 deaths. The total number of deaths fluctuated but generally increased, with the highest count observed in the last week at 56026. The observed trends suggest a growing impact of respiratory illnesses on mortality rates, which may signal a strain on healthcare resources and the need for heightened public health interventions.
