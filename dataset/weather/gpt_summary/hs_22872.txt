Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a gradual increase in temperature, reaching a peak during the later hours before experiencing a slight decline. Humidity levels started high and saw a downward trend through the day, suggesting a decrease in moisture in the air which could lead to more comfortable conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable with only minor fluctuations, indicating stable weather conditions without the immediate likelihood of significant weather changes. Wind speeds were consistent, with a slight increase observed, which could contribute to a slight cooling effect despite the warm temperatures. The wind direction shifted gradually from a northeasterly to a southeasterly direction, which may have implications for moisture transport and cloud cover in the region.
