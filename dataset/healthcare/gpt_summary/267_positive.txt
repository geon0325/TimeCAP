Over the past 20 weeks, the overall percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza has consistently remained below the 20-week average of 6.26%. While the total number of specimens tested fluctuated, peaking at 44,971 in week 8, the ratio of positive specimens showed a decreasing trend, starting at 0.23% in week 1 and dropping to 0.07% by week 20. Influenza B was more prevalent than Influenza A throughout the period, with its highest positive ratio at 0.21% in week 8, though both subtypes experienced a decline in positivity rates towards the end of the period. The declining trend in positivity rates for both Influenza A and B, especially towards the end of the 20-week period, suggests a waning flu season, which could relieve some burden on healthcare resources dedicated to influenza cases. However, the healthcare system should remain vigilant and continue to monitor trends in influenza activity to manage resources efficiently and prepare for potential future surges.
