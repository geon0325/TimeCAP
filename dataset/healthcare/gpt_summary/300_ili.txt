Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a fluctuating but overall declining trend in the number of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases across all age groups. The ratio of ILI patients has consistently remained below the baseline threshold, suggesting a lower than average ILI activity within the monitored population. The highest ILI activity was observed in the age group 25-49, which at one point showed an increasing trend before declining in recent weeks along with other age groups. Despite the overall decrease, the healthcare system should remain vigilant, especially for the age group 25-49, where the number of ILI cases was most significant. The current ILI situation appears manageable, but continuous monitoring is essential to detect any potential upsurge in activity, which could strain healthcare resources.
