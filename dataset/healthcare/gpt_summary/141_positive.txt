Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable increase in both the number of specimens tested for influenza and the number of positive cases, with total specimens tested rising from 8,502 to 22,496 and positive cases for both Influenza A and B moving from 87 to 489. The percentage of positive specimens has more than doubled from the beginning of the time series, increasing from 1.02% to 2.17%, suggesting a growing prevalence of influenza in the tested population. Influenza A has consistently been more prevalent than Influenza B, with the latest ratios being 1.73% and 0.44% respectively, indicating a higher transmission rate or dominance of Influenza A in the current flu season. The upward trend in positive cases, particularly for Influenza A, could signal a potential strain on healthcare resources, necessitating increased preparedness for influenza management. Despite the average positive ratio being 6.26% over a longer period, the current upward trend over the 20 weeks analyzed requires close monitoring to guide public health interventions and resource allocation.
