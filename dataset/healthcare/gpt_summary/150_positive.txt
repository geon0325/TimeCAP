Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant increase in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, rising from a low of 1.34% to a peak of 16.35%, before settling at 12.14% in the latest week. Influenza A has been the predominant strain, with its positive specimen ratio increasing sharply from 0.99% to a high of 15.79%, and it currently represents the majority of the positive cases at 11.79%. In contrast, Influenza B has maintained a relatively stable presence, with its percentage of positive specimens fluctuating slightly but generally remaining below 0.60%. The peak ratio of positive tests for both strains occurred in week 18, suggesting a potential peak of the influenza season. This trend indicates a higher than average influenza activity, which may strain healthcare resources due to increased patient volume and could necessitate enhanced public health measures to manage the spread of the virus.
