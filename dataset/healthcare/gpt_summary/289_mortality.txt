Over the last 20 weeks, the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia to the total number of deaths has varied, with a notable increase from a low of 6.18% in week 7 to a high of 14.15% in week 12. The average ratio over this period is 8.47%, which is above the historical average of 7.84%, indicating a recent upward trend in mortality due to these illnesses. The total number of deaths peaked in the last two weeks at 67,820 and 70,021 respectively, coinciding with an increase in deaths attributed to Influenza or Pneumonia. In particular, deaths from pneumonia have shown a significant rise in week 20 at 8,324, the highest in the given timeframe, despite the number of deaths from influenza remaining relatively stable and much lower in comparison. This pattern suggests a growing impact of pneumonia on overall mortality, which may require increased healthcare resources and targeted public health interventions to manage.
