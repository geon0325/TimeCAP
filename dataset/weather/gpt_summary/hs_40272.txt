Over the last 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable diurnal temperature fluctuation with warmer temperatures during the day, which gradually decreased towards the early morning hours and then rose again. Humidity levels showed significant variation, with a peak at 100% coinciding with the lowest temperatures, suggesting possible early morning fog or dew. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight increase through the day, indicating steady weather conditions without the immediate approach of a significant weather system. Wind speeds varied moderately, with some increase in velocity towards the end of the period, while wind direction was predominantly from the south-southeast, consistent with Houston's typical wind patterns. The combination of high humidity and changing wind speed could lead to varying cloud cover and potential for localized weather events such as brief showers or thunderstorms.
