Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable upward trend in the ratio of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the average ratio increasing from 0.78% in the first week to 4.26% in the last week, indicating a significant rise in influenza activity. The data reveals that Influenza A has been driving this increase, as evidenced by its positive specimen ratio climbing from 0.35% to 3.38%, which is a more substantial rise compared to Influenza B, which moved from 0.43% to 0.88% over the same period. The total number of specimens tested rose steadily, peaking at 21,542 in the penultimate week, suggesting increased testing activity potentially due to heightened awareness of respiratory illnesses. The observed increase in positive specimens, especially for Influenza A, could indicate the onset of a more aggressive influenza season, which may strain healthcare resources and necessitate a public health response to manage the impact. Given these trends, healthcare systems should be prepared for an influx of influenza cases, reinforcing the need for vaccination campaigns and resource allocation to manage the potential surge.
