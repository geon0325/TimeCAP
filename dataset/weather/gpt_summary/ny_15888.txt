Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature, indicating a trend of cooling down after a warmer period. Humidity levels have varied, with significant increases that could contribute to the feeling of mugginess and potential for fog or mist formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable but showed a slight downward trend, which could suggest an approaching weather system that may lead to changes in weather patterns, including the possibility of precipitation. Wind speeds were mostly mild to moderate, with occasional gusts that could amplify the chill factor, particularly when temperatures were at their lowest. The wind direction has been variable, predominantly from the south and southwest, which is typical for warmer air influxes, but there was a noticeable shift to a northerly direction at one point, possibly contributing to the cooling trend observed.
