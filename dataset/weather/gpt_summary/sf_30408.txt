Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a modest fluctuation in temperatures with a general cooling trend overnight before warming up again during the day. Humidity levels showed significant variation, starting at moderate levels, peaking at full saturation during the night, and then dropping to very low levels in the afternoon, which could have implications for comfort and visibility conditions such as fog formation in the early hours. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with only minor variations, indicating a period of steady weather patterns, but a slight rise in pressure at the end of the period could suggest an incoming high-pressure system that may lead to clearer skies. Wind speeds varied moderately throughout the day, with a noticeable increase mid-day, which could affect marine and aerial activities around the city. The wind direction changed significantly over the course of the day, with occasional shifts towards the north, which in San Francisco can bring cooler air from the ocean, possibly leading to a drop in temperature and an increase in fog along the coast.
