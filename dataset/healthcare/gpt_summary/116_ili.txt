The analysis of the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data over the last 20 weeks reveals a decreasing trend in both the number of patients reported and the number of ILI cases across all age groups. The ratio of ILI patients has consistently remained below the baseline of 2.9%, indicating a generally mild ILI season. The most significant decrease in ILI cases was observed in the age group of 5-24 years, which typically represents a highly socially active demographic and can be a significant vector for the spread of ILI. The age group of 65 or more, which is often at higher risk for complications from ILI, has also seen a decrease in ILI cases, suggesting lower immediate risk to this vulnerable population. Despite the downward trend, the healthcare system should remain vigilant for potential upticks in ILI activity, especially as seasonal changes occur or new viral strains emerge.
