Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a fluctuation in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with an overall average positivity rate of 6.26%. The data shows an initial decrease in the positivity rate from 6.23% to a low of 2.06% by week 5, followed by a steady increase peaking at 9.89% in week 18, before slightly declining to 8.16% by week 20. Influenza A has been the predominant strain throughout the period, with its positivity rate closely mirroring the overall trend and reaching as high as 9.85% in week 18. Influenza B has remained a minor contributor to the overall positivity rate, never exceeding 0.17%. These trends indicate a mid-period decline in influenza cases followed by a resurgence, suggesting that healthcare resources may need to be adjusted to address potential increases in patient load and that public health interventions may be necessary to control the spread of influenza A.
