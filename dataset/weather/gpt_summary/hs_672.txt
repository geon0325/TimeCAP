Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, peaking during the afternoon hours, followed by a mild decrease towards the evening. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, with notably high humidity during the nighttime and early morning hours, which likely contributed to a feeling of mugginess. Air pressure remained relatively stable for most of the period, with a noticeable drop that could be indicative of a transient weather system passing through the area. Wind speeds were predominantly light with occasional gusts, which may have provided some relief from the humidity. Wind direction varied but was generally from the north, shifting towards the east and then becoming variable at times, suggesting that local weather patterns might be influenced by larger-scale weather systems.
