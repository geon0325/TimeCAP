Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the incidence of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) across different age groups. Initially, the ratio of ILI patients remained below the baseline threshold but subsequently rose, surpassing it for several consecutive weeks, indicating a period of heightened ILI activity. Particularly, the age group 5-24 showed a significant spike in ILI cases, which could suggest a higher transmission rate among school-aged children and young adults. The data also demonstrates that the older population (aged 65 or more) had the lowest number of ILI cases, yet still contributed to the overall increase in the ILI percentage. This sustained elevation above the baseline requires increased healthcare resources and could imply a potential strain on healthcare systems, necessitating continued surveillance and possibly increased vaccination efforts.
