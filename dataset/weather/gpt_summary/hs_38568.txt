Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a noticeable decline in temperature from day to night, typical of its subtropical climate, followed by a gradual increase as the day progressed. Relative humidity levels exhibited significant fluctuations, reaching saturation at certain points, which could have contributed to fog or dew formation during the early hours. Atmospheric pressure showed a general increasing trend, suggesting a period of stable weather conditions moving into the area. Wind speeds were mostly moderate and consistent, with a few hours of increased velocities, and the wind direction primarily indicated northerly flows with a brief period of southerly winds, which may have influenced the temperature and humidity variations. Overall, these indicators point towards a stable weather pattern with typical diurnal temperature variations and no immediate signs of severe weather disturbances.
