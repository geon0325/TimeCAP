Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has shown a gradual increase, indicating a warming trend that persisted throughout the day and into the evening. Humidity levels have fluctuated, with a noticeable increase in the later hours, suggesting a rise in atmospheric moisture that could lead to more muggy conditions. Air pressure has been slowly decreasing, which is often associated with the approach of a weather system that could bring changes in the weather, such as increased cloudiness or precipitation. Wind speed experienced some variability, with an increase in the later hours, which could contribute to cooler perceived temperatures and the dispersal of any localized pollution. Lastly, the wind direction shifted from southerly to southwesterly, which in Houston, can bring warmer air from inland and potentially affect local weather patterns.
