Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature experienced a diurnal cycle with a warm peak during the afternoon and a cooler trend during the night and early morning hours, as is typical. Humidity levels were high throughout the day, reaching saturation at certain points, which could indicate the presence of fog or mist, particularly when combined with the cooler night temperatures. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight decrease observed, which suggests stable weather conditions but could also be indicative of a minor change in the weather pattern. Wind speeds varied from calm to moderate breezes, with an increase in the evening, and the predominant wind direction was southeasterly, shifting to southerly and back, which is common for the region and could contribute to warm air advection. Overall, the weather in Houston has been stable, but the high humidity and variable winds could lead to localized weather events such as morning fog or evening breezes.
