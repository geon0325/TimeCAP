Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon, which is typical for the region's diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels have shown considerable fluctuations, with notably higher humidity during the nighttime hours, which could contribute to a feeling of increased mugginess and discomfort for residents. Air pressure remained relatively steady throughout most of the day, with a slight increase during midday, indicative of stable weather conditions, although there was a noticeable dip towards the end of the observed period. Wind speeds varied, with calmer winds at night and more brisk conditions during the day, which might have provided some relief from the heat. Wind direction was predominantly from the south to the southeast, which is common for Houston and could be associated with bringing in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, influencing both temperature and humidity levels.
