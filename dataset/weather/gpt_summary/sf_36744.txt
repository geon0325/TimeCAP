Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a noticeable drop in temperature, indicating a cooling trend that persisted throughout the day. Relative humidity levels were highly variable, with several instances of full saturation, suggesting the presence of fog or mist, particularly during the cooler hours. Air pressure experienced a significant rise in the morning, followed by a gradual decrease, which could be indicative of a transient high-pressure system affecting the area. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate with occasional gusts, and wind direction was variable, although there was a period where winds consistently came from the southeast. These conditions, combined with the fluctuating humidity and temperature, point to an unsettled weather pattern that could lead to changes in cloud cover and precipitation levels.
