Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperature has demonstrated a cyclical pattern typical of a coastal city, with a peak during the day followed by a cooling trend at night. Relative humidity has shown variations but spiked significantly towards the end of the period, indicating a possible increase in moisture that could lead to foggy conditions or morning dew. Air pressure remained relatively stable, experiencing a slight increase in the middle of the period, which is commonly associated with stable weather patterns. Wind speeds fluctuated but remained mostly gentle to moderate, which is not likely to result in significant wind-related impacts. The wind direction varied, with a general shift from northerly to westerly and then to southwesterly directions, which may influence coastal fog development and temperature distribution across the city.
