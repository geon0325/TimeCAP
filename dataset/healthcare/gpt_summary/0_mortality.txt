Over the last 20 weeks, the data reveals a consistent downward trend in the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia relative to the total number of deaths, decreasing from 8.11% to 6.20%, which sits below the average ratio of 7.84%. The total number of deaths fluctuated but showed a slight overall decline, starting at 59,763 and ending at 52,480. Deaths from pneumonia exhibited a gradual decrease over the period, from 4,558 to 3,201, while deaths from influenza initially increased, peaking at 605 in week 8, before falling to 53 in week 20. The decrease in the mortality ratio suggests improvements in either the prevention or treatment of Influenza and Pneumonia, or a shift in the cause of mortality to other conditions. These trends indicate a potential easing burden on healthcare resources specifically allocated for Influenza and Pneumonia, which may allow for reallocation to other areas in need.
