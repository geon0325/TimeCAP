Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature, with a general upward trend during the day followed by a slight decrease at night. Humidity levels were extremely high for the majority of the period, reaching saturation at several points, which could have led to a muggy feeling and possibly foggy conditions, particularly when combined with the lower nighttime temperatures. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight increase in the middle of the period, indicative of fair weather conditions that are not conducive to significant weather disturbances. Wind speeds were mostly light and variable, with calm conditions observed during several hours, which would not have provided much relief from the high humidity. Lastly, wind direction shifted frequently, suggesting a lack of a dominant weather system influencing the area during this time frame.
