Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have shown a slight fluctuation, overall indicating a minor cooling trend with the lowest temperatures recorded in the early morning hours, followed by a gradual increase into the afternoon. Humidity levels reached saturation during the night, suggesting the possibility of fog or mist formation, which could have reduced visibility and impacted early morning transportation. Air pressure remained relatively stable, although there was a slight decreasing trend, which could indicate the approach of a minor weather system or changes in local weather patterns. Wind speeds were mostly calm, with a slight uptick towards the end of the period, while the prevailing wind direction shifted from the southwest to a more westerly direction. The combination of high humidity, stable air pressure, and gentle winds from the ocean suggests that the weather has been relatively mild but with a potential for morning coastal fog that could clear up later in the day.
