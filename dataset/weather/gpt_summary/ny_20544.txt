Over the last 24 hours in New York City, temperatures have exhibited a decreasing trend, transitioning from slightly above freezing to well below freezing by the end of the period. Humidity levels remained high initially but experienced a notable dip in the middle of the time period, suggesting a dry air mass briefly moved through the area, before levels rose again towards the end. Air pressure varied, with a significant drop mid-period indicating the likely passage of a frontal system, followed by a steady increase, which is typically associated with the arrival of high-pressure conditions and more stable weather. Wind speeds were generally light but increased slightly towards the end of the period, which could contribute to a wind chill effect given the cold temperatures. The wind direction showed a shift from southwesterly to northwesterly, consistent with the passage of a weather front and the subsequent inflow of colder air from the northwest.
