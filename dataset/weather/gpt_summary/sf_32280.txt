Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have displayed a typical diurnal pattern with a peak during the daytime and a gradual decrease through the night into the early morning hours. Humidity levels started moderately high and saw a slight increase during the night, which is expected given the cooling temperatures and stable air pressure conditions. Speaking of air pressure, there has been a slight but steady decrease throughout the period, suggesting a weakening high-pressure system that might allow for more variable weather in the near term. Wind speeds have been generally light with some variability, and the wind direction has shifted throughout the day, predominantly coming from the west but with some notable variations, including calmer conditions during the night. Such wind behavior is characteristic of coastal cities like San Francisco, where ocean breezes can influence local weather patterns significantly.
