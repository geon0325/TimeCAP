Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has experienced a downward trend, dropping from 4521.54 to 4170.70, indicative of investor caution and potential concerns about market stability. Concurrently, the VIX, commonly known as the "fear index," has increased from 21.44 to 35.13, reflecting heightened market volatility and investor uncertainty. International markets have mirrored this sentiment, with Japan's Nikkei 225 and the UK's FTSE 100 both trending downwards, the latter notably dipping from 7567.10 to 6964.10, which may suggest a global risk-off mentality. Commodity prices, however, have moved inversely to equities, with Gold Futures and Crude Oil Futures both rising, signaling a possible flight to safe-haven assets and concerns over oil supply disruptions. Currency exchange rates have seen the Euro and the Yen depreciate against the Dollar, with EUR/USD dropping from 1.14 to 1.09 and USD/JPY rising from 115.06 to 115.37, potentially indicating a stronger demand for the relative safety of the US dollar.
