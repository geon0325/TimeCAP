Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 demonstrated a general upward trend, climbing from 2955.45 to 3097.74, despite some volatility, suggesting a cautiously optimistic investor sentiment towards U.S. equities. The VIX, or Volatility Index, experienced an increase towards the end of the period, rising from 28.16 to 35.12, which indicates a growing concern about potential risk among investors. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 also showed an overall increase, with the Nikkei moving from 20388.16 to 22478.79 and the FTSE 100 from 5993.30 to 6292.60, reflecting a positive sentiment in global equity markets. Gold Futures saw a slight uptick from 1734.60 to 1745.90, which could be interpreted as investors seeking a safe haven amid market uncertainties. The foreign exchange rates remained relatively stable, with minor fluctuations in EUR/USD, USD/JPY, and USD/CNY pairs, indicating a current equilibrium in currency valuations but also the potential for sudden shifts due to external factors or policy changes.
