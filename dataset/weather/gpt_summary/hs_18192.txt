Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature with a general cooling trend during the night followed by a warming trend in the daytime. Humidity levels remained high throughout, which is typical for the region, but showed a slight decrease as the temperature increased later in the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable, suggesting a period of settled weather without significant fronts or storms. Wind speeds were consistently light, which would have done little to disperse the humidity or cause significant wind chill effects. The predominant wind direction was from the northeast, shifting slightly at times, but no major directional changes were observed that would indicate the passage of a weather system.
