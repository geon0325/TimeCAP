Over the last 20 weeks, the proportion of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases among the total patient count has remained below the 2.9% threshold, indicating a relatively moderate influenza situation. The highest ILI patient ratios were recorded in the most recent weeks, with a gradual increase from 1.20% to 2.18%, suggesting a possible upward trend in ILI prevalence. The age group of 0-4 years consistently reported the highest number of ILI cases, peaking at 11,376 in the last week, which could indicate higher susceptibility or transmission rates within this demographic. Notably, all age groups exhibited an increase in ILI cases towards the end of the 20-week period, which may signal the onset of a more active influenza season and could necessitate increased healthcare resources and preventative measures. Despite the uptick, the ILI percentages have not reached a level that would typically raise significant concern for public health officials; however, the trend warrants close monitoring to manage potential healthcare system impacts effectively.
