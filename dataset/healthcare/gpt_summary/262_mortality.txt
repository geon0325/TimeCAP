Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable decrease in the mortality rate from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, with the initial ratio of 16.09% dropping to 6.05% by the end of the period. This decline in mortality rate corresponds with a reduction in the total number of deaths, which started at 84,956 and decreased to 57,036 by week 20. The absolute number of deaths attributed to pneumonia showed a significant downward trend, starting at 13,527 and decreasing to 3,367, which could suggest improvements in either prevention or treatment of pneumonia. However, the number of deaths from influenza fluctuated with less dramatic changes over this period, peaking at 149 in week 2 and reaching a low of 65 in weeks 7 and 8. Given that the observed mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia is well above the average of 7.84%, despite a downward trend, these diseases remain a significant concern for the healthcare system, indicating a need for continued vigilance and resource allocation.
