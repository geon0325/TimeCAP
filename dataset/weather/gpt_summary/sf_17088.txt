Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco experienced relatively stable temperature conditions with minor fluctuations, indicating a steady weather pattern. Humidity levels remained high throughout the period, reaching saturation at several points, which suggests a likelihood of fog or mist, especially during the early hours when temperature and humidity conditions typically lead to such phenomena. Air pressure was consistently high and stable, indicating a continued pattern of fair weather and possibly contributing to the persistence of the fog or mist by suppressing air movement. Wind speeds were exceptionally calm, remaining at the lowest measurable limit, which would have done little to disperse humidity or pollutants, potentially leading to reduced visibility or air quality issues. Wind direction varied slightly but largely came from the southwest, which is typical for coastal San Francisco and may have contributed to the cool and moist air coming from the ocean.
