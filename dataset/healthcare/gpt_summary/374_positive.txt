Over the last 20 weeks, the testing data for respiratory specimens indicates a significant decrease in the percentage of influenza-positive cases, with a peak ratio of positive tests at 26.27% in week 1, declining to just 0.84% by week 20. Influenza A has been the dominant subtype throughout the period, though its incidence has also sharply decreased from 26.15% to 0.37% of specimens tested. Meanwhile, the incidence of Influenza B has remained relatively low but more stable, with a slight increase in positivity ratio towards the middle of the period, peaking at 0.56% in week 18, before settling at 0.47% in week 20. The overall average positivity ratio of 6.26% suggests that the flu season may have peaked earlier in the analyzed period and is now on a decline. Healthcare providers should be aware of these trends for resource allocation and to remain vigilant for potential changes that could indicate new outbreaks or shifts in influenza activity.
