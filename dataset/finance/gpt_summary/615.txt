Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a general uptrend, closing higher at 4369.55 from an initial 4247.44, indicating a positive momentum in US equities. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, has fluctuated but ended slightly above its starting point, suggesting a stable but cautious market sentiment. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 experienced volatility with a downward bias, closing lower than their initial values, which may reflect investor uncertainty in Asian and European markets. Gold futures, after a significant dip to 1773.80, have recovered and trended upwards, closing at 1810.00, possibly indicating a flight to safety among investors. Exchange rates show the US dollar strengthening against the Japanese yen but weakening against the Chinese yuan, while remaining relatively stable against the euro, which could have mixed impacts on international trade and foreign investment flows.
