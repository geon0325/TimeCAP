Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates that mortality from influenza and pneumonia has fluctuated, with a notable peak in the last three weeks where the ratio of mortality from these causes to total deaths significantly exceeded the average ratio of 7.84%, reaching as high as 19.40%. This surge is particularly pronounced when compared to mid-series weeks, where the ratio dipped to its lowest at 5.20%. The number of deaths from pneumonia far outweighs those from influenza, suggesting that pneumonia is a more significant contributor to the increased mortality ratio. The sharp increase in the ratio of mortality from influenza or pneumonia in recent weeks could imply an outbreak or a seasonal spike, necessitating increased healthcare resources and a potential public health response. Total deaths also rose markedly in the last three weeks, which may indicate a broader health crisis or reporting anomaly that warrants further investigation.
