Over the last 24 hours in Houston, there has been a notable diurnal temperature variation, with the warmest conditions occurring in the late afternoon and cooler temperatures in the early morning hours, typical of the region's climate pattern. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, starting relatively low, increasing sharply overnight as temperatures dropped, and then decreasing again during the daytime, which is indicative of the passage of a frontal system or the effect of nocturnal cooling. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively steady and high throughout the period, suggesting stable weather conditions, although there was a slight decreasing trend towards the end of the period that could signal an approaching change in weather patterns. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a peak in the later hours that could contribute to an increased wind chill factor, making it feel cooler than the actual temperature. The wind direction was variable, predominantly from the south to southwest, shifting to a more northerly direction at times, which could be associated with the movement of weather systems across the area.
