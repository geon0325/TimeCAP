Over the last 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, indicating a warming trend that peaked in the late afternoon hours before stabilizing. Relative humidity levels varied widely, with a particularly high spike during the early morning, which may have contributed to morning dew or fog conditions, but then levels normalized, suggesting more comfortable conditions prevailed for the remainder of the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day with a significant fluctuation in the evening, which could have been associated with a transient weather system passing through the area. Wind speeds were generally moderate but showed an increase in the late afternoon and early evening, pointing to breezier conditions that could have affected outdoor activities. The prevailing wind direction was predominantly westerly, with some variability, which is typical for the region and can influence coastal weather patterns and air quality.
