Over the last 20 weeks, the total number of respiratory specimens tested for influenza has fluctuated, peaking at 43,510 in the penultimate week. The ratio of positive specimens has remained relatively stable, averaging 6.26%, with no clear upward or downward trend, indicating a consistent presence of influenza in the tested population. Influenza A detections have been relatively steady, with a slight increase in the last week, while Influenza B showed a more varied pattern, peaking at 0.09% positivity in week 3. The highest overall positivity rate for both Influenza A and B occurred in week 2, suggesting a potential spike in cases that did not sustain over time. Given the consistent detection of influenza, health systems should maintain preparedness for managing a stable influx of influenza cases alongside other respiratory infections.
