Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature exhibited a gradual increase, reaching its peak in the later hours before showing a slight decrease. Humidity levels started high and remained relatively stable until the latter part of the day, when they decreased significantly, suggesting drier air moving into the area. Air pressure saw minor fluctuations but overall indicated a stable atmospheric condition with no significant changes that would suggest the immediate approach of a new weather system. Wind speeds were consistently low throughout the period, indicating a period of calm weather, while wind direction shifted from southeasterly to easterly and then to northeasterly, which may influence local weather patterns, including temperature and humidity levels.
