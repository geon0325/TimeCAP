Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a notable decrease in temperature, indicative of a cooling trend. Humidity levels experienced significant fluctuations, starting high, decreasing substantially during the middle of the period, and then rising again towards the end, suggesting variable atmospheric moisture content. Air pressure rose considerably, particularly towards the end of the time frame, which could be associated with the arrival of a high-pressure system, potentially leading to more stable weather conditions. Wind speeds varied, with a period of increased activity, followed by a gradual decrease, which might affect the dispersion of any present air pollutants and influence the wind chill factor. The wind direction shifted multiple times, indicating the presence of changing weather systems moving through the area.
