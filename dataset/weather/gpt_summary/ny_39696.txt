Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, which is consistent with the diurnal cooling trend as night approached. Humidity levels varied, initially staying low but later increasing significantly, which could have led to a perception of cooler temperatures and possibly the formation of early morning fog or mist. Air pressure experienced a substantial increase, indicative of a high-pressure system moving into the area, which is generally associated with stable and clearer weather conditions. Wind speed was mostly light to moderate, with some variability, but without any intense gusts that would cause concern for outdoor activities. The wind direction was predominantly from the west to the northwest, which is typical for the region and can contribute to cooler temperatures, especially during the night and early morning hours.
