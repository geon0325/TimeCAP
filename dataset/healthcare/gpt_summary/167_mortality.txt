Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the mortality ratio from influenza or pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, with a peak of 15.78% in week 4 followed by a gradual decline to a low of 7.33% in week 15, before rising again to 10.69% in the most recent week. The total number of deaths peaked in week 4 with 78,946 cases and then exhibited a decreasing trend, stabilizing around the mid-64000s in the last two weeks. Deaths specifically attributed to influenza have significantly decreased from 558 in week 1 to 13 by week 20, indicating a possible seasonal reduction or effective control measures. In contrast, deaths from pneumonia showed a sharp increase in the initial weeks, reaching a high of 11,988 in week 4, but have since demonstrated a declining trend, albeit with a slight uptick to 6,840 in the last week. This pattern suggests a potential strain on healthcare resources during peak periods, emphasizing the need for continued vigilance and preparedness for managing respiratory illnesses.
