Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a peak of 27.37% in week 11, followed by a general decline to 15.11% by week 20. Influenza A has been the predominant strain, accounting for a higher percentage of positives compared to Influenza B throughout the period, although its prevalence has decreased from 21.62% in week 7 to 5.57% in week 20. Meanwhile, Influenza B showed a concerning increase in the ratio of positive specimens, rising from 1.48% in week 2 to a peak of 10.95% in week 14, before slightly decreasing to 9.54% by week 20. The initial sharp increase in positive specimens, particularly with Influenza A, could have put significant stress on healthcare resources due to increased hospitalization and outpatient visit rates. The recent decrease in the overall positivity rate may indicate a potential easing of the influenza season, but the relatively high and sustained positivity rate for Influenza B suggests continued vigilance and healthcare resource allocation for B strain-specific cases.
