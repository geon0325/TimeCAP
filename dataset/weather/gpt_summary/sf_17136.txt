Over the past day in San Francisco, the temperature displayed a mild fluctuation with a general upward trend towards the latter hours. Humidity levels remained high throughout the period, suggesting a likelihood of persistent moisture in the air, which could lead to foggy conditions, particularly in coastal areas. Air pressure was relatively stable but showed a slight decreasing trend, which may indicate an approaching weather system that could result in changes in the current weather pattern. Wind speeds were consistently light, which would have minimal impact on dispersing the high humidity and could contribute to the development of dew or fog. The wind direction was predominantly westerly, which is characteristic of San Franciscoâ€™s climate and may bring in marine air, reinforcing the cooler and moist conditions.
