Over the last 24 hours in New York City, there has been a gradual increase in temperature, transitioning from well below freezing to more moderate conditions. The relative humidity saw significant fluctuations, with notably drier air moving in during the later hours, which could enhance the comfort level despite the cold. Air pressure levels remained relatively high and stable, a sign of prevailing fair weather conditions without any major disturbances. Wind speeds varied, with some gustier conditions earlier on, calming significantly towards the end of the period, which may have reduced the wind chill effect for New Yorkers.
