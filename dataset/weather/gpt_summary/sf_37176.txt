Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there was a gradual decrease in temperature which later saw a modest rebound, suggesting a typical diurnal pattern with cooler temperatures overnight transitioning to warmer conditions by afternoon. Humidity levels experienced significant fluctuations, starting at moderate levels before increasing substantially during the night, indicative of a potential marine layer presence, followed by a sharp decrease towards the afternoon, possibly due to increased heating and mixing of the air. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight dip followed by a return to initial levels, suggesting steady atmospheric conditions without the presence of significant frontal systems. Wind speeds varied, with calmer conditions in the early hours, increasing during the day, and then tapering off; this is consistent with the typical daily wind pattern of coastal areas. The wind direction shifted from southeasterly to northerly and then predominantly westerly, which may have influenced the temperature and humidity variations, as different wind directions can bring air from various sources, such as cooler ocean waters or warmer inland areas.
