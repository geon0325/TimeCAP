Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable upward trend in both the number of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza and the corresponding positive ratios, with a significant increase in recent weeks. The average positive ratio of 6.26% has been exceeded in the last five weeks, peaking at 7.31% in the final week. Influenza A has consistently been more prevalent than Influenza B, with its positive ratio rising sharply from 1.21% to 5.70%, suggesting an intensifying spread. The increase in positive specimens for Influenza B, from 0.63% to 1.60%, though less pronounced than for Influenza A, still represents a significant surge. This escalating trend signals a potential strain on healthcare resources and highlights the need for public health readiness, including increased surveillance, vaccination efforts, and possibly antiviral stockpiling.
