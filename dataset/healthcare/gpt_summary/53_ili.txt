The analysis of the 20-week time-series data for Influenza-like Illness (ILI) shows an initial period where the ILI ratio remained below the baseline threshold, followed by a noticeable increase where the ratio exceeded the baseline for several weeks, indicating a higher prevalence of ILI cases. This surge peaked and was sustained for a duration before gradually declining back below the baseline in recent weeks. Age-specific data reveals that the highest number of ILI cases were consistently reported in the youngest age group (0-4 years), while the lowest numbers were observed in the oldest age group (65 years or more), suggesting that ILI has been more prevalent among the younger population. The overall trend of ILI cases across all age groups has decreased towards the end of the period, aligning with the reduction in the overall ILI ratio. The peak period of ILI activity would have put additional strain on healthcare resources, but the current downward trend indicates a potential easing of the healthcare burden.
