The VIX, a measure of market volatility, has shown a significant upward movement from 15.15 to 31.99, which confirms this heightened market anxiety. The Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have followed a similar downward trajectory, with the Nikkei dropping from 23319.56 to 21100.06, and the FTSE 100 from 7482.50 to 6815.60, indicating a broader global market retreat.

Currency markets have seen the USD weakening against both the EUR and JPY, with EUR/USD moving from 1.10 to 1.12 and USD/JPY declining from 109.45 to 107.04, which could be indicative of concerns over the US economic outlook.
