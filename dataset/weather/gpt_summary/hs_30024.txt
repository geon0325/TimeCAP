Over the last 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have experienced a gradual decrease overnight, reaching a minimum before sunrise, followed by a notable increase during the day, which is a typical diurnal pattern. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, indicating possible fog or dew formation, and then significantly dropped towards the afternoon, which could be associated with the increase in temperature and suggests drier conditions later in the day. Air pressure showed minor fluctuations but remained relatively stable, with a slight downward trend towards the evening, which might indicate a weak change in the weather system. Wind speeds varied, with calmer conditions prevailing during the early hours and winds picking up speed towards the end of the period, which could affect outdoor activities and aviation. Wind direction was predominantly from the south to southeast, shifting more southerly later in the period, which is typical for Houston and could be responsible for bringing in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico.
