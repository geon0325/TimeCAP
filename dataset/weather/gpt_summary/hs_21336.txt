Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has exhibited a gradual downward trend from the initial readings, followed by a slight increase and stabilization towards the end of the period. Relative humidity levels have remained consistently high, approaching saturation for several hours, which suggests a strong possibility of fog or mist formation, particularly during the cooler night and early morning hours. Air pressure has shown a slight but steady increase throughout the period, indicating a potential for stable weather conditions and possibly clear skies. Wind speeds have been consistently light, with minimal fluctuation, which might contribute to the persistence of any fog or mist due to the lack of significant air movement. Lastly, the wind direction has varied, initially coming from the south and shifting to a predominantly northwestern direction before making a noticeable shift back towards the south and then east, suggesting variable wind patterns that could affect localized weather conditions.
