Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, transitioning from relatively cooler conditions in the early hours to noticeably warmer conditions towards the end of the period, reflecting typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuation, with very high values in the early morning, indicative of possible morning fog or dew, decreasing substantially towards the evening, which suggests drier air moving into the area. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting a steady atmospheric condition without significant frontal activity. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a slight increase in intensity later in the period, which could contribute to the lower humidity levels observed. The wind direction varied but predominantly came from the south to southwest, shifting more westerly and then to the north, which may be associated with the passage of a weather system and the subsequent change in air masses affecting the region.
