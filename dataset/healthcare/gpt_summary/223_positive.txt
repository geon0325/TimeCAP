Over the last 20 weeks, the proportion of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza has shown a marked decrease from a peak of over 30% to less than 1%. This decline suggests a significant reduction in influenza activity, with a concurrent decrease in both Influenza A and B positive specimens. Influenza A showed a higher peak positivity rate and a more pronounced decline compared to Influenza B. The current low positivity rate of 0.17% for all specimens is substantially below the 20-week average of 6.26%, indicating a potential end to the influenza season. Healthcare providers should remain vigilant for potential changes in trends, but the current data likely indicates a decreased burden on the healthcare system from influenza.
