Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable increase in the proportion of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the percentage of positive specimens rising from 1.40% in week 1 to a peak of 14.00% in week 19, before a slight dip to 13.34% in the final week, well above the 20-week average of 6.26%. Influenza A has shown a significant uptrend, with its ratio of positive specimens escalating from 1.01% to a high of 12.83%, indicating a predominant circulation of this strain. In contrast, Influenza B displayed a more stable pattern, with a gradual increase in the ratio of positive specimens from 0.40% to 1.17%, suggesting a lesser but persistent presence. The dramatic rise in the ratio of positive tests, especially for Influenza A, in the latter weeks suggests a potential surge in influenza cases that could strain healthcare resources. The data indicates the importance of enhanced surveillance, increased vaccination efforts, and possible antiviral readiness to manage the growing influenza activity.
