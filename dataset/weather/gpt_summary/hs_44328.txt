Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual rise in temperature, peaking during the late afternoon hours, which is typical for the region's climate. Humidity levels showed significant variation, with notably lower values in the afternoon corresponding with the peak temperatures, indicating a drier atmosphere during the hottest part of the day. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight decreasing trend towards the end of the period, which could suggest an approaching weather system that may affect local conditions. Wind speeds were mostly light and demonstrated a decrease through the day, which could lead to reduced dispersion of air pollutants and might result in lower air quality. Wind direction was predominantly from the north-northwest, with a shift to more westerly directions in the latter part of the day, potentially bringing changes in temperature and humidity levels.
