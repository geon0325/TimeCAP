The data indicates an upward trend in the ratio of positive specimens for both Influenza A and B throughout the 20-week period, reaching a peak in weeks 9 and 10 for Influenza A (20.21%) and B (6.23%), respectively, before both began to decline. In particular, the overall percentage of positive specimens surged from 4.26% in week 1 to a high of 24.73% in week 10, demonstrating a substantial increase in influenza activity, which could have put a significant strain on healthcare resources due to increased patient load. After week 10, there was a noticeable decline in positive specimens for both strains, with the latest data showing a reduction to 9.70% positivity, indicating a potential easing of the influenza season. Despite this decline, the ratio of positive specimens for Influenza B remains disproportionately high relative to Influenza A in the later weeks, which could suggest a shift in the prevalent strain and may have implications for vaccine formulation and public health strategies. The healthcare system should remain vigilant and continue to monitor these trends closely to manage resources effectively and prepare for potential future outbreaks.
