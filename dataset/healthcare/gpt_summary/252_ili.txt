Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in the incidence of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) across different age groups. In the early weeks, the ratio of ILI patients remained below the baseline threshold, but as the weeks progressed, there has been a consistent trend of increasing ILI activity, exceeding the baseline and reaching its peak in the most recent data. The most significant uptick in ILI cases has been observed in the 0-4 and 5-24 age groups, which could indicate a higher transmission rate among young populations, potentially impacting schools and childcare facilities. The sustained elevation above the baseline in the later weeks suggests a more widespread community transmission of ILI, which may put increased pressure on healthcare resources, particularly if this trend continues or escalates. The data indicates that healthcare providers should remain vigilant and prepared for a continued influx of ILI patients, with a possibility of resource reallocation to manage the higher patient volume effectively.
