Over the last 24 hours in New York City, temperatures have experienced a gradual increase before plateauing, indicating a trend towards warmer conditions. Humidity levels were high throughout the day, peaking at saturation during the early morning hours, which could have led to morning fog or mist. The air pressure remained relatively stable, with only minor fluctuations, suggesting steady weather without the immediate onset of significant weather events. Wind speeds varied modestly, but a noticeable increase was observed in the evening, potentially contributing to cooler perceived temperatures and the dispersion of any daytime urban heat accumulation. Wind directions shifted from northeasterly to southerly and finally to a more south-easterly direction by the end of the period, which might indicate the movement of a weather system through the area.
