Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature with a general trend towards warming, culminating in conditions that are warmer than the initial recordings. Humidity levels have been high, often reaching saturation, which could have contributed to a feeling of mugginess and may have implications for local weather phenomena such as fog or mist. Air pressure has shown a general decrease after a period of relative stability, suggesting a change in the weather pattern that could be associated with the arrival of a new weather system. Wind speeds have been mostly light to moderate, with some calm periods, but there has been an increase in wind speed in the most recent hours, which could indicate the approach of a frontal system. Lastly, wind direction has varied but predominantly featured southerly and southeasterly winds, with a notable shift to a northeasterly direction mid-period, before returning to southerly directions, which is characteristic of changing weather systems in the region.
