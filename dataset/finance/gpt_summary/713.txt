Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 showed moderate fluctuations but ended with a significant decline, dropping from 4605.38 to 4594.62, which might signal a turn towards a bearish market sentiment. The VIX, commonly referred to as the "fear index," remained relatively stable until it spiked on the last day to 28.62, indicating a sudden increase in market volatility and investor anxiety. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 also displayed volatility with a general downward trend, closing lower at 28751.62 and 7044.00 respectively, which could reflect broader global market uncertainties. Gold futures saw an overall increase in value, suggesting a possible flight to safety by investors amidst market turbulence, with prices starting at 1783.00 and edging up to 1785.30. Lastly, crude oil futures experienced a sharp decline in the period, from 83.57 to 68.15, hinting at potential concerns over future economic growth and demand, while the major currency pairs of EUR/USD and USD/JPY displayed minor fluctuations, but the USD/CNY remained notably stable, suggesting a steady stance by the Chinese yuan against the US dollar.
