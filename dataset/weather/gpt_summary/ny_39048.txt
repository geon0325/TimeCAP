Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a gradual increase in temperature, transitioning from below freezing to slightly warmer conditions, which is indicative of a warming trend. Humidity levels showed significant variability, with a spike to saturation suggesting the possibility of fog or precipitation, followed by a sharp decrease indicating drier air moving into the area. Air pressure remained relatively stable and high, with a slight decrease towards the end of the period, which typically suggests settled weather but could indicate a change approaching. Wind speeds were mostly moderate, with some fluctuations, and predominantly came from the westerly direction, which could have contributed to the transport of drier air from inland areas. The wind direction shift to more of a westerly and southwesterly orientation towards the end of the period could be associated with the slight rise in temperatures observed.
