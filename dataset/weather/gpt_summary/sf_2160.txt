Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have experienced a gradual decline during the night followed by a rise after sunrise, with the lowest point occurring just before dawn and the highest in the late afternoon, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels showed a significant increase during the early morning hours, likely contributing to cooler and potentially foggy conditions, a common occurrence in this coastal city. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight fluctuation midday, suggesting stable weather patterns without the presence of significant fronts or storm systems. Wind speeds were generally light and variable, with a notable increase in the evening, which may disperse any lingering coastal fog and bring clearer skies. The wind direction varied widely throughout the day, with no predominant direction, which is typical for the region due to its complex topography and maritime influences.
