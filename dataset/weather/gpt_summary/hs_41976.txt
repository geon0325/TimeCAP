Over the last 24 hours in Houston, there has been a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before a subtle decline towards the evening, indicative of typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, with a notable increase during the early hours possibly due to nocturnal cooling leading to condensation and a higher likelihood of fog or dew. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight overall decrease, suggesting a stable weather pattern without significant frontal movements or storm systems affecting the area. Wind speeds were generally light with some increase towards the latter part of the day, which could provide some relief from the heat. Wind direction varied, with a general shift from southerly to northerly and then easterly directions, which may influence local temperature and humidity as different air masses move into the region.
