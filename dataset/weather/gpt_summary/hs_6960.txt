Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable diurnal pattern in temperature, with the highest values recorded in the afternoon and a gradual cooling trend towards the early morning hours. Humidity levels followed a reverse trend, increasing during the night and early morning, which can be attributed to the lower temperatures and could potentially lead to morning fog or dew. The air pressure experienced a slight decrease throughout the day, which might indicate the approach of a weather system or front that could alter the current weather conditions in the near future. Wind speeds remained mostly light and constant, with a sudden drop to calm conditions in the latest hour, suggesting a temporary lull in the breeze. The wind direction was predominantly easterly, shifting to a southerly direction briefly before returning to an easterly flow, then making a significant shift to a westerly direction towards the end of the period, which could signal an incoming change in weather patterns.
