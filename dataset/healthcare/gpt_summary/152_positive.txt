Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a significant increase in the proportion of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the overall positivity rate rising from an initial 1.75% to a peak of 16.35%, before slightly decreasing to 16.32% in the most recent week. Notably, Influenza A has been the predominant strain, with its positivity rate escalating from 1.22% to 15.87%, while Influenza B has shown a more stable presence with a slight increase from 0.53% to 0.44%. The number of specimens tested each week has generally increased, reaching a high of 44,453 in week 18 before a slight decrease in weeks 19 and 20. The spike in Influenza A cases, particularly from week 14 onwards, corresponds to a more than fourfold increase in positive specimens, indicating a potentially significant influenza A outbreak. This upward trend in influenza activity, especially the dominance of Influenza A, could strain healthcare resources and necessitates increased vigilance, vaccination efforts, and preparedness for managing a higher patient load.
