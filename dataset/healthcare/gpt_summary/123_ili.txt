Over the past 20 weeks, the reported incidence of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) has remained below the baseline threshold necessary to indicate a significant influenza outbreak. All age groups followed a similar trend, with the highest number of ILI cases consistently reported in the youngest cohort (age 0-4). After a period of relative stability, the ratio of ILI patients began to increase modestly towards the latter weeks, suggesting a slight uptick in ILI activity. Despite this increase, the overall percentage of ILI patients remained well under the baseline, indicating that influenza is not widespread at this time. Healthcare systems should continue to monitor these trends, especially in the youngest population, but current data does not suggest an immediate need for increased influenza-related healthcare resources.
