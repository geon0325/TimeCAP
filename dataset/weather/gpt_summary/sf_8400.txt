Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a notable fluctuation in temperature, starting off relatively warm then cooling down significantly before increasing again towards the end of the period. Humidity levels have shown a general decrease throughout the day, with particularly high levels observed during the cooler early hours, which is typical as cooler air can hold less moisture. Air pressure experienced some variability with a sharp increase at one point, which could be indicative of a transient weather system passing through the area. Wind speeds remained mostly gentle but picked up towards the end of the period, potentially signaling a change in weather patterns or the approach of a new system. The predominant wind directions have been varied, with a slight preference towards westerly and northwesterly directions, which is common for coastal cities like San Francisco due to maritime influences.
