Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have experienced a moderate diurnal fluctuation, with a peak during the afternoon hours and a gradual decrease toward the early morning. Humidity levels have shown a general inverse correlation with temperature, increasing as the temperature dropped and vice versa. Air pressure has remained relatively stable throughout the period, with only minor fluctuations indicating a lack of significant weather fronts passing through the area. Wind speeds have been mostly gentle to moderate with some increase in velocity towards the end of the period, while the wind direction has been predominantly northerly, with an occasional shift to the southeast. Overall, these conditions suggest stable weather patterns, but the increase in wind speed could indicate the approach of a changing weather system.
