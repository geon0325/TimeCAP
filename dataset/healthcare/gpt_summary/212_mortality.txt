Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable decrease in the mortality ratio of influenza and pneumonia in relation to total deaths, starting at 16.09% and ending at 6.48%, which is below the average ratio of 7.84%. The total number of deaths has shown fluctuations but presents a slight downward trend over the period. Deaths specifically due to pneumonia have consistently declined from 12,257 to 3,691, while deaths from influenza remained low with a non-significant fluctuation. This decreasing trend in pneumonia mortality may indicate improvements in healthcare interventions, public health measures, or seasonal variations. However, the persistent presence of influenza-related deaths, despite being low, requires continued surveillance to manage and prevent potential outbreaks.
