Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature with a general trend towards cooling, especially noticeable during the nighttime hours. Humidity levels remained relatively high throughout the period, indicating a persistent presence of moisture in the air, which may have contributed to a feeling of mugginess. Air pressure showed some variability with a significant spike, which could be associated with transient weather systems passing through the area. The wind speed was mostly light to calm, suggesting limited dispersion of air pollutants and possibly leading to reduced air quality. Wind direction varied but predominantly came from the westerly quadrant, which is typical for the region and could bring in cooler air from the ocean.
