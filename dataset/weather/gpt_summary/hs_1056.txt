Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have shown a gradual increase, indicating a warming trend that peaked during the later hours of the period. Humidity levels experienced a noticeable decrease as temperatures rose, suggesting drier conditions as the day progressed. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight fluctuation, which is typical for stable weather patterns, but there was a minor decrease toward the end of the period that could signal a change in weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate with some periods of calm; however, there was variability in wind direction, which implies a lack of a dominant weather front. Overall, the combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and stable air pressure with variable winds points towards fair weather, but the slight pressure decrease could indicate an approaching weather system.
