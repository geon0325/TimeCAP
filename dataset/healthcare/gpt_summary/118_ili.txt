Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable decline in the number of patients presenting with Influenza-like Illness (ILI), with the ratio of ILI patients falling below the baseline of 2.9% and reaching its lowest point midway through the period. The age group 0-4 consistently reported the highest number of ILI cases compared to other age groups, indicating a higher susceptibility or exposure risk in this demographic. Notably, the latter weeks of the period saw a slight resurgence in ILI cases across all age groups, although the overall ratio of ILI patients remained well below the baseline. This downward trend in ILI incidence may reduce the immediate strain on healthcare resources dedicated to acute respiratory illnesses. However, the recent uptick warrants continued surveillance to preempt any potential surge in ILI cases, which could signal the onset of a more active influenza season.
