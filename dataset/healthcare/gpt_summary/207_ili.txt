The time-series data for Influenza-like Illness (ILI) over the last 20 weeks indicates a notable seasonal fluctuation, with the ratio of ILI patients starting significantly above the baseline and showing a peak before gradually declining to well below the baseline in the most recent weeks. The age group of 5-24 years has consistently reported the highest number of ILI cases, which suggests a higher transmission rate or susceptibility within this demographic, likely impacting schools and universities. In contrast, the lowest number of cases was reported in the age group of 65 or more, which could be attributed to higher vaccination rates or better preventive measures among this population. The overall decreasing trend in ILI cases across all age groups in the recent weeks may suggest that the ILI season is waning, potentially easing the burden on healthcare resources. However, the healthcare system should remain vigilant for any potential resurgence and ensure continued public health messaging, especially targeting the most affected age groups, to control the spread of ILI.
