Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature followed by a slight rebound in the later hours, indicative of a typical diurnal temperature variation. During the same period, humidity levels fluctuated moderately, suggesting variable atmospheric moisture that could affect comfort levels and precipitation potential. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the day, signaling the likely influence of a high-pressure system moving into the area, which is often associated with clearer and more stable weather conditions. Wind speeds showed a general decrease, with the winds calming as the day progressed, which could lead to less wind chill effect and more settled weather.
