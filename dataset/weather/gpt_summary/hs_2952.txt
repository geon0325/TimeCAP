Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the weather has exhibited a gradual warming trend, with the temperature rising significantly, suggesting a shift from cooler morning conditions to warmer afternoon conditions. Humidity levels have shown a notable decrease as temperatures peaked, which is typical as warmer air can hold more moisture, leading to a relative drop in humidity. Air pressure experienced a steady high before a slight decrease later in the day, potentially indicating the approach of a weather system that could disrupt the stable conditions. Wind speeds were generally light with a slight increase observed towards the end of the period, while wind direction varied, showing a predominantly southerly flow turning to a northerly direction before shifting to southeasterly, which could be associated with the movement of air masses and weather fronts in the region. These factors combined suggest a stable weather pattern transitioning to potentially more dynamic conditions, warranting attention for any subsequent changes that may affect the local weather.
