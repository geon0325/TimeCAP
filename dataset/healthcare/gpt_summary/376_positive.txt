Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant decline in the ratio of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a peak at 20.78% in week 1 decreasing to 0.94% by week 20. Influenza A has shown a more pronounced decrease compared to Influenza B, with Influenza A positive specimens dropping from 20.68% to 0.38%, while Influenza B has fluctuated less dramatically and increased slightly from 0.09% to 0.57% over the same period. Despite the overall downward trend, the ratio of positive specimens for Influenza B as a proportion of all positive specimens has increased, suggesting a relative shift in prevalence from Influenza A to B. The overall declining trend in positive specimens suggests a decrease in influenza activity, which may lead to a reduced burden on the healthcare system in terms of influenza-related hospitalizations and care. However, the persistence of Influenza B and its slight increase in proportion signals the need for continued surveillance and possibly targeted healthcare strategies for managing and preventing Influenza B infections.
