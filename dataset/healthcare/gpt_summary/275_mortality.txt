Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths has consistently remained below the average of 7.84%, with a slight upward trend in the later weeks, peaking at 6.58% in week 18. Despite fluctuations, the total number of deaths has been relatively stable, with a noticeable increase to 59727 in week 15 before stabilizing. The number of deaths from influenza has significantly decreased over the period, dropping from 94 to 14, indicating a potential decrease in influenza incidence or improved management. In contrast, deaths from pneumonia have shown less variability, with a slight increase in the recent weeks, suggesting a persistent burden on the healthcare system. The overall mortality ratio increase in the later weeks could indicate a seasonal effect or changes in the prevalence of these respiratory conditions, warranting close monitoring and potential resource allocation for prevention and treatment.
