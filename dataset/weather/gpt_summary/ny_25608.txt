Over the last 24 hours, New York City has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature, with a general trend of cooling towards the end of the period. Humidity levels varied significantly, showing a sharp peak indicating possible fog or rain conditions, followed by a decrease which suggests clearer weather later on. Air pressure has been steadily increasing, which is typically associated with stable weather conditions and a decrease in storm probability. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, but there were periods of calm winds and also a few instances of higher wind speeds. Notably, the wind direction was variable but predominantly from the east-northeast, which could influence coastal conditions and temperature due to marine influences.
