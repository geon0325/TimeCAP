Over the last 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperatures, reaching a peak in the later hours, indicative of a shift towards warmer conditions. Humidity levels varied considerably, with notable peaks during the cooler early hours, which could have led to instances of morning mist or fog, but decreased significantly as temperatures rose, suggesting a drier atmosphere by day's end. Air pressure showed minor fluctuations, maintaining a relatively steady state with a slight decreasing trend, which could suggest stable weather patterns but also the potential for developing weather systems. Wind speeds were mostly gentle to moderate throughout the period, but there was a significant increase towards the end, indicating the possibility of a windy evening ahead. The wind direction varied widely, suggesting a changing weather pattern, and with the predominant directions being westerly to southwesterly, this could potentially usher in weather systems from those directions.
