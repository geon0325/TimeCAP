The time-series data for Influenza-like Illness (ILI) over the past 20 weeks indicates a significant fluctuation in patient numbers, with a noticeable peak in the ratio of ILI patients which eventually declines toward the end of the observed period. The highest ratios were seen in the middle of the timeline, suggesting a period of intense ILI activity that could have put additional strain on healthcare resources. Age distribution data reveals that the highest incidence of ILI was among the 5-24 and 25-49 age groups, indicating that these populations were particularly affected. Toward the end of the period, there was a marked decrease in ILI ratios across all age groups, with the latest data falling below the baseline threshold for determining the influenza situation. Such trends underscore the importance of ongoing public health surveillance and the potential need for targeted interventions in specific age groups during peak ILI activity.
