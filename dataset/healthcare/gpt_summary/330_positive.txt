Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant fluctuation in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, peaking at 9.89% in week 10, with a notable decline to 2.36% by week 20. Influenza A has remained the predominant strain throughout the period, with its peak positivity rate at 9.85% also in week 10, before falling to 2.30% in week 20. Meanwhile, Influenza B has consistently represented a small fraction of positive cases, with its highest positivity rate at 0.17% in week 8. The overall downtrend in positive specimens suggests a decrease in influenza activity, which could indicate the tail end of the flu season or the effectiveness of public health interventions. Despite the recent decline, the healthcare system may still need to maintain preparedness for managing cases, especially given the earlier weeks where the positivity rate was substantially higher than the 20-week average of 6.26%.
