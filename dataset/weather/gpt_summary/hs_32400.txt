Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak during the later hours of the day, indicative of typical diurnal warming patterns. Humidity levels started extremely high in the early hours but experienced a significant decrease as temperatures rose, suggesting an inverse relationship between temperature and humidity throughout the day. Atmospheric pressure showed a slight declining trend, which could signal the approach of a low-pressure system, potentially leading to changing weather conditions such as increased cloudiness or precipitation chances. Wind speeds remained relatively light and consistent, with a slight increase observed later in the day, while wind direction shifted from southeasterly to southerly and ultimately to a more southwesterly direction, which might contribute to the transportation of warmer air masses into the region. These conditions combined are indicative of warm and humid weather typical of Houston's climate, with the possibility of evolving weather patterns due to the slight drop in pressure.
