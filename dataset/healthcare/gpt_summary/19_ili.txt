The time-series data for Influenza-like Illness (ILI) over the last 20 weeks reveals that the percentage of ILI patients relative to total patients has remained consistently below the baseline of 2.9%, indicating a relatively mild ILI season to date. However, there has been a gradual increase in the ILI ratio over the last few weeks, suggesting a potential uptick in ILI cases that could warrant closer monitoring. Notably, the age group 0-4 consistently presented with the highest number of ILI cases, which may require targeted health interventions for young children. The oldest age group (65 or more) showed the least variability in ILI patient numbers, suggesting a stable pattern in this demographic. Healthcare providers should remain vigilant, as the recent upward trend in the ILI ratio may lead to increased healthcare utilization and could strain healthcare resources if the trend continues.
