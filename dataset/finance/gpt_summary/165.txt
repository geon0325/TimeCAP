Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a general upward trend, moving from 2887.94 to 2984.87, indicating bullish market sentiment. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, fluctuated but ended slightly lower, suggesting that while there has been some uncertainty, overall market fear has not increased significantly. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 indices both exhibited upward movement, reflecting positive investor sentiment across major global markets. Commodity prices saw Gold Futures retreating from a high of 1550.30 to 1504.60, while Crude Oil Futures experienced volatility with a sharp spike to 62.90, followed by a pullback to 56.49, potentially due to geopolitical tensions or inventory changes. Exchange rates showed minor fluctuations with the EUR/USD and USD/CNY pairs remaining relatively stable around 1.10 and 7.12 respectively, while the USD/JPY pair showed a slight depreciation of the dollar against the yen, moving from 105.74 to 107.16, which could suggest a shift towards safe-haven currencies in light of market uncertainties.
