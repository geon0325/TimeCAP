Over the last 20 weeks, the trend in influenza-like illness (ILI) has shown a gradual increase in the ratio of ILI patients, indicating a potential rise in influenza activity. The age groups most affected have consistently been the youngest (0-4 years) and school-age children (5-24 years), with a notable increase in reported ILI cases in these demographics over the period. Although the overall percentage of ILI patients has remained below the baseline of 2.9%, it has approached this threshold in recent weeks, suggesting a possible escalation in the near future. The healthcare system may face increased demand, especially in pediatric and family medicine services, due to the higher incidence among younger age groups. Precautionary measures, such as vaccination and public awareness campaigns, may be advisable to mitigate further spread and the associated strain on healthcare resources.
