Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the latest recorded hours, indicating a warming trend. Humidity levels were notably high during the night and early morning, consistent with 100% humidity that often accompanies fog in the region, but decreased significantly towards the afternoon and evening, suggesting clearer conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout most of the day, with a slight decline in the last recorded hours, which could precede a change in weather patterns, such as the arrival of a new weather system. Wind speeds were moderate and varied, with a period of increased speed, which could have contributed to dispersal of early fog or low clouds. The wind direction was predominantly from the northerly quadrant, but a significant shift to a southerly direction occurred in the afternoon, before returning to northerly, which could influence coastal conditions and temperature variations.
