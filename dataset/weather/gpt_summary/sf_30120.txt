Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature with a general cooling trend towards the latter part of the period. Humidity levels varied significantly, with notable dips and rises, indicating changing atmospheric moisture that could have influenced the feel of the temperature at ground level. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor variations, although there was a noticeable increase towards the end of the period, which could suggest incoming fairer weather conditions. Wind speeds were mostly gentle to moderate, with a few hours where higher speeds were recorded, potentially contributing to a wind chill effect that made it feel cooler.
