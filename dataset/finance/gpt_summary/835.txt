Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has experienced significant volatility, with a notable drop to 3991.24 before recovering to 3973.75, suggesting uncertainty in the U.S. equity market. The VIX, or fear index, has shown elevated levels above historical averages, peaking at 34.75, which implies increased market stress and potential for future market swings. International indices like the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 also reflected this turbulence, with the Nikkei showing a slight upward trend ending at 27001.52 after some fluctuations, and the FTSE 100 recovering to 7513.40 after a dip to 7216.60, indicating resilience in these markets despite global pressures.

Commodity prices have seen mixed movements: Gold Futures have remained relatively stable with a slight uptick from 1901.40 to 1847.80, suggesting a flight to safety among investors, while Crude Oil Futures have shown more volatility, yet ended slightly higher at 110.29 from an initial 101.70, which may signal ongoing concerns about supply disruptions. Currency exchange rates for EUR/USD and USD/JPY have experienced mild fluctuations, indicating a relative stabilization in currency markets, while USD/CNY saw a modest depreciation of the dollar against the yuan, closing at 6.69 from an opening of 6.56, which could signify shifts in trade dynamics or currency policy adjustments by China.
