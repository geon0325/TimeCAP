Over the last 20 weeks, the proportion of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases remained above the 2.9% severity benchmark for the first two weeks, indicating a higher demand for healthcare resources. Subsequently, ILI proportions have consistently trended downward, with the latest week recording a rate of 1.97%, signifying a reduction in ILI incidence and potential easing of the strain on healthcare systems. Age distribution of ILI cases shows that the highest numbers were reported in patients aged 25-49 at the start, but this has also decreased over time, similar to the trends observed in other age groups. Notably, the total number of patients across all age groups peaked in week 6, aligning with elevated ILI rates, but has since fluctuated without surpassing the earlier peak. The current data suggest a general decline in ILI activity, which may lead to reduced hospitalization and outpatient visits for ILI symptoms, allowing healthcare providers to allocate resources to other areas as needed.
