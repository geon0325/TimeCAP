The data indicates a significant upward trend in the ratio of positive influenza specimens over the last 20 weeks, rising from 0.55% to 8.29%, which suggests an escalating influenza season. Influenza A is the predominant strain, with its positivity rate increasing from 0.49% to 8.24%, which reflects a consistent growth and accounts for the majority of the positive cases. The ratio of positive specimens for Influenza B remains relatively low and stable, with minimal fluctuations around the 0.06% mark indicating that Influenza B is not the driving factor in the current trend. The peak testing period saw 147,040 specimens tested in week 8, with a decrease in testing volume since then, despite the continued increase in the positivity rate. This situation could potentially strain healthcare resources due to the rising number of influenza cases and necessitate increased surveillance and preventive measures such as vaccination and public health advisories.
