Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant upward trend in Influenza-like Illness (ILI) across all age groups, with a marked increase in the proportion of ILI cases in the patient population, exceeding the 2.9% severity benchmark in the last six weeks. The highest increases in ILI cases were observed in the age groups 0-4 and 5-24, where the number of patients more than quadrupled, suggesting a potentially higher transmission rate among young populations. The percentage of ILI patients out of the total patient count rose from 1.65% to a peak of 7.37%, indicating a substantial surge that could stress healthcare resources. Notably, the ratio of ILI patients remained below the 2.9% threshold for the first 14 weeks, but since then, it has consistently exceeded this benchmark, reaching over double the threshold in the most recent weeks. This escalation points to an ongoing and intensifying influenza season, necessitating increased medical preparedness, possible public health interventions, and heightened awareness among healthcare providers and the public.
