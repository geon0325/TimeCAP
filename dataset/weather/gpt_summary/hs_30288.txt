Over the last 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have exhibited a notable warming trend, reaching peak values in the late afternoon before a slight cooling occurred in the later hours. Humidity levels started high and peaked at full saturation in the early morning, which could have led to morning fog or dew, then decreased significantly during the day, indicating drier conditions as the temperature rose. Air pressure showed a gradual decline, suggesting a possible shift in weather patterns that could bring instability or changing weather conditions in the near future. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate throughout the period, with a slight increase in the later hours, which could contribute to a dispersal of humidity and potential cloud cover. The predominant wind directions were southerly to southeasterly, shifting towards a more southerly and then southwesterly direction, which is often associated with warmer air being drawn into the area.
