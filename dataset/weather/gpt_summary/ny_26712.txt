Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual rise in temperature, indicative of a warming trend. Humidity levels saw significant fluctuations, starting off moderate, peaking at very high during the early morning hours, before dropping to lower values as the temperature increased, suggesting a possible early morning fog that cleared as the day progressed. Air pressure has been on a slight but steady decline, which could be associated with a change in weather patterns, possibly the approach of a weather front. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with some increase noted later in the day, which may have contributed to the dispersal of humidity and a clearer sky. The wind direction has been predominantly from the southwest to the west, which is typical for milder conditions in the region during this time.
