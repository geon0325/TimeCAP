Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have exhibited a typical diurnal pattern, with a gradual increase during the daytime followed by a decrease towards the evening, remaining within a relatively narrow range that suggests stable weather conditions. Humidity levels have seen more variation, with significant fluctuation that could have contributed to variable sensations of comfort and possibly leading to periods of mugginess. Air pressure has remained relatively steady with only slight variations, indicating a stable atmospheric condition without the immediate presence of strong weather fronts or systems. Wind speeds have been mostly gentle to moderate with some instances of increased velocity, with the prevailing winds showing a predominantly southerly to southeasterly direction, which is common for this region and could be responsible for the transport of moisture-laden air. The consistency in wind direction coupled with the fluctuations in humidity might hint at passing localized weather phenomena, such as sea breezes or isolated thunderstorms, which are characteristic of Houston's climate.
