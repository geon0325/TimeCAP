Over the last 20 weeks, the data reveals a significant decline in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for both Influenza A and B, with a peak ratio of 22.49% in week 1 dropping to 0.37% by week 20. The highest number of specimens tested occurred in week 2 (74416), aligning with the highest recorded absolute numbers of positive cases for both Influenza A (9077) and B (2690). The ratio of positive specimens for Influenza A decreased more drastically than for Influenza B, with a steep decline from 17.23% to 0.18% compared to a decrease from 5.27% to 0.19% for Influenza B, indicating a faster reduction in Influenza A transmission or detection. Despite fluctuations in the number of specimens tested, the ratios of positive specimens have consistently decreased, suggesting a diminishing spread of influenza during the observed period. This trend may lead to a reduction in influenza-related healthcare burden, but continued surveillance is necessary to monitor for potential resurgences.
