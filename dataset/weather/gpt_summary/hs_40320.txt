Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before slightly declining towards the evening. Humidity levels varied significantly, starting at moderate levels in the early hours, increasing to a high in the early morning, and then decreasing towards the late afternoon, suggesting the presence of moisture that could lead to discomfort or precipitation. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with only minor fluctuations, indicating a steady atmospheric condition that is unlikely to prompt any immediate, significant changes in the weather pattern. Wind speeds were mostly gentle to moderate throughout the day, with a slight increase during the late afternoon and evening hours, which could contribute to a slight cooling effect. The wind direction was predominantly from the south to southeast, with a notable shift to due south by the end of the 24-hour period, which is typical for Houston and may bring in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico.
