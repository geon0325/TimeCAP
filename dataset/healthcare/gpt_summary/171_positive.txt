Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a general decrease in the number of respiratory specimens tested for influenza, with initial values starting at 42,041 and ending at 14,371, indicating a possible seasonal decline in testing demand. Despite the reduction in total tests, the ratio of specimens testing positive for Influenza peaked in week 5 at 26.03% and has since shown a consistent downward trend to 3.08% in week 20, suggesting a waning influenza activity or effective public health interventions. The data reveals that Influenza A has been the dominant strain, with its highest positivity rate at 25.06% in week 5, but a notable decrease to 1.48% by week 20, while Influenza B maintained a relatively low and stable positivity rate, with a peak at 1.85% in week 14. This decreasing trend in influenza positivity rates points toward a potential easing of the burden on healthcare resources related to influenza management. However, healthcare systems should remain vigilant and prepared for potential future surges, as influenza patterns can change, and annual fluctuations are common.
