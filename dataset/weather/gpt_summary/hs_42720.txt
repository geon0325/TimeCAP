Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before slightly cooling off. Humidity levels showed a downward trend as the temperature increased, starting high in the early morning and dropping significantly by the evening, suggesting a drier atmosphere as the day progressed. Air pressure remained relatively stable but saw a slight increase towards the middle of the day, which is typical of diurnal atmospheric patterns. Wind speeds varied moderately throughout the period, with no significant gusts, maintaining gentle to moderate breezes that would not have a drastic impact on the weather conditions. The wind direction was predominantly from the south to southwest, which is consistent with warm air being drawn up from the Gulf of Mexico, contributing to the higher temperatures observed.
