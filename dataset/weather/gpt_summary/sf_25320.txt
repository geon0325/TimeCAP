Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature with a general cooling trend during the overnight hours and a warming trend during the daytime, suggesting a typical diurnal pattern. Humidity levels have seen significant variation, with a notable spike in the evening, indicating possible fog or marine layer influence. Air pressure experienced a slight increase through the majority of the period, stabilizing at a higher level before a sharp drop, which could signal the approach or passage of a weather front. Wind speeds have been moderate with some increases, particularly during the later hours, and shifts in wind direction have been observed, ranging from northerly to westerly, which may affect local weather conditions such as fog dispersion and temperature changes. The combination of these factors points to dynamic weather conditions, which could involve periods of fog, changing cloud cover, and varying temperatures throughout the day.
