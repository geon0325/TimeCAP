Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a moderate fluctuation in temperature, with a general trend of warming followed by a slight cooling period towards the end of the observed window. The relative humidity levels have been variable but showed a high percentage during the cooler early hours, which is typical as cooler air can hold less moisture before it condenses. The air pressure readings have seen some significant fluctuations, indicating the possibility of rapidly changing weather patterns that could result in unsettled weather conditions. Wind speeds have remained relatively calm throughout the period, with only a slight increase in the last few hours. The prevailing wind direction has been predominantly from the south to south-west, which is often associated with warmer air masses moving into the area.
