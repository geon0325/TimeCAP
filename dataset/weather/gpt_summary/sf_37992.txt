Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a slight decrease in temperature, which then stabilized and slightly increased towards the current hour. Humidity levels varied considerably but have shown a general trend of decrease from earlier peaks, suggesting a drier atmosphere as the day progressed. Air pressure remained relatively steady with only minor fluctuations, indicating stable weather conditions without significant changes in weather patterns. Wind speeds were mostly gentle but picked up in intensity during the latter half of the period, with a notable shift in direction from easterly to southerly and then transitioning to a westerly direction. The combination of decreasing humidity, stable pressure, and changing wind patterns may point to clear and stable weather conditions with potential for cooler and breezier conditions following the wind shift.
