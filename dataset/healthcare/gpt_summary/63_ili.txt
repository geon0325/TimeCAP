The reported incidence of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) has shown a consistent decline over the last 20 weeks, with the ratio of ILI patients falling below the baseline of 2.9%. This trend is observed across all age groups, indicating a widespread decrease in ILI cases. The most substantial decrease is noted in the youngest age bracket (0-4 years), which typically signals a significant drop in overall transmission rates, as younger children are often efficient transmitters of respiratory infections. Despite the overall decline, healthcare systems should maintain vigilance for potential upticks in ILI cases, as such trends can reverse, especially with seasonal changes. Continuous monitoring remains crucial to ensure resources and preventive measures are adequately aligned with the current low ILI activity to maintain public health.
