Over the last 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching a peak before slightly declining towards the end of the observed period. The humidity levels have shown variability, starting relatively high, decreasing midday, and increasing again towards the evening, indicative of changing atmospheric moisture conditions throughout the day. Air pressure has seen a general decrease initially, followed by a rise, suggesting the potential movement of a weather system through the area. Wind speeds have been mostly light to moderate, with a notable increase in the later hours, potentially influencing wind chill and the dispersion of any airborne particles in the city. The wind direction has been predominantly from the south-southwest, shifting dramatically to a westerly and then northwesterly direction in the latter part of the period, which could indicate the passage of a frontal system.
