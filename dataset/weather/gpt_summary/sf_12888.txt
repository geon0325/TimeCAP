Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperature exhibited a typical diurnal pattern, with a nighttime decline followed by a daytime increase, stabilizing with slight fluctuations towards the end of the period. Humidity levels were relatively high, particularly during the night and early morning, which could have resulted in misty conditions or heightened dew presence. Air pressure remained steady for most of the day, indicating stable weather conditions, but a significant drop was observed towards the end of the period, which could suggest the approach of a weather system that may alter current conditions. Wind speeds varied, with a noticeable increase at one point, which could have influenced wind chill factors and dispersion of any fog or mist. The wind direction was predominantly from the west and northwest, except for a brief shift in direction, which is consistent with San Francisco's typical maritime climate influenced by oceanic breezes.
