Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a significant fluctuation in the rate of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a peak ratio of positive specimens reaching 26.27% in week 11, followed by a subsequent decline to 1.67% by week 20. Influenza A has been the predominant strain, with its highest positivity rate at 26.15% in week 11, overshadowing Influenza B, which peaked at only 0.21% positivity in week 20. The total number of specimens tested reached its highest at 191,785 in week 11, coinciding with the peak positivity rates, suggesting a possible correlation between increased testing and detection of influenza cases. The downward trend in positivity rates for both Influenza A and B in the latter weeks may indicate a waning phase of the influenza season, but continuous monitoring is essential to detect any potential resurgence. Healthcare systems should remain vigilant in managing resources as the data suggests a potential easing of influenza cases but also underscores the necessity for sustained influenza surveillance and vaccination efforts.
