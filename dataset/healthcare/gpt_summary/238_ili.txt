Over the past 20 weeks, the data indicates a consistent uptrend in the number of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases across all age groups, with the most significant increases observed in the youngest (0-4 years) and the school-age (5-24 years) cohorts. The proportion of ILI patients to total patients has also been rising, surpassing the baseline threshold in recent weeks, which suggests a growing impact of ILI on the healthcare system. This trend is particularly concerning as the ratio of ILI patients has reached its peak in the latest data point, indicating a potential escalation in the spread of influenza or ILI-symptomatic diseases. The sustained increase in ILI cases, especially among the younger populations, could lead to heightened strain on pediatric healthcare services and resources. Public health authorities may need to consider reinforcing preventive measures, raising public awareness, and ensuring adequate healthcare preparedness to manage the increasing ILI activity.
