Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a slight fluctuation in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with an average positivity rate of 6.26% against observed values that ranged between 1.90% and 3.54%. Influenza B has shown a recent upward trend in positivity rates, culminating at 1.86% in the latest week, which indicates a possible increase in its activity or spread within the population. Conversely, Influenza A's positivity rates have decreased to 0.88% in the most recent week, suggesting a relative decline in its prevalence. The number of specimens tested peaked in the latest week at 17,349, possibly due to increased testing following a rise in respiratory illnesses or heightened surveillance measures. The fluctuating but persistent presence of both influenza strains suggests that health systems should remain vigilant and prepared for potential surges in flu cases, which may require adequate resources for testing, treatment, and vaccination efforts.
