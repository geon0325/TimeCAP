Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a noticeable warming trend with a peak in temperature during the late afternoon hours. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuation, with a sharp decrease during the warmer part of the day before rising again towards the evening. Air pressure has been gradually declining, which could be indicative of a changing weather system, possibly leading to increased chances of weather instability or precipitation. Wind speeds remained mostly light throughout the period, with some variability in direction, suggesting a lack of dominant weather fronts influencing the area. The combination of high humidity, warming temperatures, and decreasing air pressure could lead to the development of fog, especially in coastal and bay areas, which is typical for San Francisco's microclimate.
