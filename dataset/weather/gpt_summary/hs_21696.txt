Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature with a general cooling trend during the early hours, followed by a warming trend that peaked towards the late afternoon. Humidity levels showed a corresponding inverse pattern, decreasing as temperatures rose and reaching their lowest in the late evening. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight downward trend, indicating stable weather conditions that may persist. Wind speeds were mostly light to gentle, with a slight increase towards the current hour, while wind direction was predominantly from the south, veering slightly between south-southeast and south-southwest throughout the period. This consistency in wind direction suggests a steady flow of air from the Gulf of Mexico, which could influence humidity and temperature in the coming hours.
