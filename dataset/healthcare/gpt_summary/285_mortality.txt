Over the last 20 weeks, mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia has shown fluctuations when compared to the total number of deaths, with a notable spike in the last five weeks where the average ratio significantly exceeded the 20-week average of 7.84%. The ratio of mortality from these conditions started at around the 6% mark, which is below the average, but surged to a peak of 14.15% by the 16th week, indicating a possible outbreak or an increase in the severity of these illnesses. This surge is also reflected in the absolute number of deaths attributed to pneumonia, which saw an increase from an average of around 3600 in the initial weeks to a high of 9741 in the 16th week, despite the total number of deaths for that week being significantly higher than the average. Following its peak, the ratio has been on a decline, reaching 10.99% by the 20th week, yet it still remains above the average for the first 15 weeks. These trends suggest a period of increased stress on healthcare resources and could indicate the need for heightened surveillance and potential intervention to manage Influenza and Pneumonia-related healthcare demands.
