Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have shown a gradual increase, indicating a warming trend that is typical during daytime hours. Conversely, humidity levels experienced some fluctuations, with notable increases during periods that correspond to the cooler temperatures of the early morning and late evening, suggesting the presence of more moisture in the air during these times. Air pressure has been steadily decreasing, which could be indicative of a changing weather system that may lead to less stable weather conditions in the near future. Wind speeds have remained relatively constant, with only minor variations, indicating a steady weather pattern without significant gusts. The wind direction has gradually shifted from a predominantly easterly to a more southeasterly direction, which could influence moisture transport from the Gulf of Mexico, potentially affecting local weather conditions.
