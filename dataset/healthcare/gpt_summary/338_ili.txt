Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a steady increase in the number of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases across all age groups, with the most significant rise observed in the youngest (0-4 years) and school-aged children (5-24 years). The percentage of ILI patients has remained below the baseline threshold, indicating that the influenza situation has not reached alarming levels within the observed timeframe. However, there has been a noticeable uptick in the ratio of ILI patients toward the latter part of the 20-week period, suggesting a potential trend towards increasing ILI activity. The consistent increase in ILI cases among younger populations could indicate higher transmission rates in these age groups, warranting targeted public health interventions. Healthcare providers should remain vigilant and prepared for a possible surge in ILI cases, which could place additional burdens on healthcare resources and necessitate increased influenza prevention efforts.
