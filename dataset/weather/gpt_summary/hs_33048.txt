Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has fluctuated within a relatively narrow range, displaying a typical diurnal pattern with a gradual increase through the daytime hours followed by a decrease during the night, indicative of stable weather conditions. Humidity levels have shown a nighttime peak, which is common due to lower temperatures and decreased mixing in the atmosphere, but have decreased significantly during the day, possibly contributing to comfortable conditions. Air pressure has been on a gentle decline, suggesting a slight weakening of the high-pressure system in the area, which could lead to changes in the weather. Wind speeds remained mostly light to moderate, with occasional increases that could enhance the feeling of lower temperatures during the cooler parts of the day. The wind direction was variable, predominantly coming from the south to southeast, which is typical for this region and may contribute to the transport of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico into the area.
