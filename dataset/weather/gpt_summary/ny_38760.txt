Over the past 24 hours in New York City, the temperature has followed a typical diurnal pattern with the lowest values around early morning and a gradual increase as the day progressed, reaching the highest by late afternoon before cooling down slightly in the evening. Despite fluctuations, humidity levels generally decreased throughout the day, which is indicative of drier air moving into the area. Air pressure remained relatively high and stable, with only slight variations, suggesting a continued influence of a high-pressure system which is often associated with settled weather conditions. Wind speeds were moderate and showed a decreasing trend towards the end of the period, which could lead to less wind chill and more comfortable outdoor conditions. The wind direction was predominantly from the northwest, shifting slightly to the north-northeast by the end of the 24-hour period, which may have contributed to the slight decrease in temperatures observed in the evening.
