Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable temperature fluctuation, with a peak during the daytime and a significant drop towards the later hours, indicative of a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels varied widely, suggesting the passage of different air masses or frontal systems through the area, with periods of both very low and very high relative humidity. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor variations, indicating no significant weather disturbances. Wind speeds were generally light and variable, with a slight increase towards the end of the period, which might affect the dispersion of pollutants and could influence the chill factor for the residents. Wind direction shifted throughout the day, with a predominance of westerly winds, which is common for the region due to its coastal location and could result in the advection of marine air inland.
