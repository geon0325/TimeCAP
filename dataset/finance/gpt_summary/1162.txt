Over the past 20 market days, the S&P 500 has experienced some volatility but ended slightly higher, indicating a cautiously optimistic sentiment among investors. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, has remained relatively subdued with minor fluctuations, suggesting that while uncertainty is present, investors are not in a state of heightened fear. The Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 both showed an upward trend, signaling strength in international markets, particularly in Asia and Europe. Gold Futures have seen small oscillations but remained relatively stable, reflecting its role as a safe-haven asset amidst market fluctuations. Crude Oil Futures have increased, which could indicate growing energy demand or supply concerns, while currency exchange rates have shown minor variations, with the slight weakening of the USD against the JPY and CNY, and mixed movements against the EUR, potentially affecting international trade dynamics and investment flows.
