Over the past 20 weeks, the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia to total deaths has shown a general decline, starting at 9.03% and ending at 5.70%, which is below the 20-week average of 7.84%. This decline suggests an overall decrease in the impact of these respiratory conditions on total mortality. Despite this trend, the absolute number of deaths from both Influenza and Pneumonia remains significant, with the latest week recording 53 and 1337 deaths respectively. The total number of deaths has also decreased sharply in the last week to 24,395, which could indicate a data anomaly or a substantial change in overall mortality patterns. These trends are indicative of a possible easing burden on healthcare systems regarding Influenza and Pneumonia, but continuous monitoring is essential to understand long-term implications and to adjust public health responses accordingly.
