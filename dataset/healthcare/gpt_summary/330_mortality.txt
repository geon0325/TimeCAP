Over the past 20 weeks, the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia to the total number of deaths has shown a fluctuating trend with an initial average below the 20-week period average of 7.84%, followed by a gradual increase. The lowest ratio recorded was 5.19% in week 9, while the highest was 6.09% in the last recorded week, indicating a recent upward trend. Despite the overall mortality ratio being consistently below the average, the absolute number of deaths from pneumonia has risen, reaching its peak in the last week at 3412 deaths. The number of deaths from influenza remained relatively stable, with minor fluctuations and no clear trend. This pattern suggests that pneumonia is a more significant contributor to the increase in the mortality ratio, which could indicate a need for enhanced healthcare measures targeting pneumonia prevention and treatment.
