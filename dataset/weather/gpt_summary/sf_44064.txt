Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a gradual decline in temperature from a mild condition during the day to cooler temperatures by the end of the period, indicative of a typical diurnal pattern. Humidity levels experienced significant fluctuations, with extremely dry conditions in the daytime giving way to very high humidity levels during the night and early morning hours, which could increase the likelihood of morning fog, especially in coastal areas. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight increase towards the end of the period, suggesting steady weather conditions without the imminent approach of any significant weather systems. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with occasional gusts, and the wind direction varied throughout the day, primarily coming from the west-northwest, which is typical for San Francisco's prevailing weather patterns. The combination of increasing humidity and stable air pressure could lead to fog formation, particularly in the early morning and late evening hours, affecting visibility for commuters and potentially influencing local climate conditions.
