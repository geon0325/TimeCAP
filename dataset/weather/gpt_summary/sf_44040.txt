Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature, with a general decreasing trend during the early hours, followed by a gradual increase as the day progressed. Humidity levels experienced significant variance, with extremely high levels typically occurring during the cooler early hours, which indicates the potential for fog formation that could impact visibility. Air pressure remained relatively stable with only slight variations, indicating steady weather conditions without the presence of strong frontal systems. Wind speeds varied modestly and included a period of calm conditions; however, a noticeable increase occurred later, suggesting the potential for brisk conditions that could affect outdoor activities. The wind direction shifted throughout the day but predominantly came from the west and northwest, which is common for the region and could bring cooler ocean air inland.
