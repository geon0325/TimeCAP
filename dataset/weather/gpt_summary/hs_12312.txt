Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a gradual increase in temperature, transitioning from cooler conditions in the early hours to warmer temperatures by the end of the time series. Humidity levels started relatively high but experienced a decrease throughout the day, which may have contributed to more comfortable conditions despite the rise in temperature. Air pressure showed a general declining trend, suggesting a potential shift in weather patterns or the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds were moderate at the beginning but showed a significant decrease, even dropping to calm conditions, which could lead to a buildup of pollutants in the absence of dispersing winds. Wind direction was variable, predominantly coming from the north and shifting significantly at times, which could influence local temperature and humidity levels.
