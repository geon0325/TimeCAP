Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature, indicating a typical coastal city's diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels have been relatively high, reaching saturation at one point, which may have led to foggy conditions, particularly common in this region. An increase in air pressure was observed, suggesting the possible arrival of a high-pressure system that could lead to clearer skies and calmer weather conditions. Wind speeds remained low throughout the period, with little variation, which is characteristic of a stable weather pattern. The wind direction was primarily westerly, aligning with the prevailing winds coming off the Pacific Ocean, which could influence the city's microclimate by bringing in cooler and moister air.
