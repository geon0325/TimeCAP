Over the last 20 weeks, mortality due to Influenza or Pneumonia has consistently remained below the 20-week average of 7.84%, indicating a downward trend in the proportional impact of these illnesses on overall deaths. The ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia to total deaths has shown a decline from 6.64% in the first week to 5.20% in the final week, with the lowest recorded value at 5.20% in the last week and the highest at 6.64% in the first week. Despite fluctuations, the number of deaths attributed to pneumonia has decreased from 4002 to 2869, while influenza-related deaths have also seen a reduction from 65 to 22 over the 20-week period. This decrease in the proportion and absolute numbers could suggest an improvement in prevention, management, or a seasonal decline in these respiratory conditions. However, the persistent presence of these diseases underlines the continued need for vigilance and resources in the healthcare system to manage and prevent these potentially serious infections.
