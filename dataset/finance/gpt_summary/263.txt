Over the past 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a gradual increase, indicating a bullish trend with a closing high of 3380.16, despite some intermittent fluctuations. The VIX, which tracks market volatility, has generally trended downwards from a peak of 18.23, ending at 13.68, suggesting that investor anxiety has eased somewhat. In contrast, the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 have experienced more volatility with overall declines, indicating regional market pressures and potential concerns in the UK and Japanese economies. Gold Futures have seen a steady uptrend, closing at 1582.70, which may signal a move towards safe-haven assets amidst global uncertainties. Exchange rates have shown the USD strengthening against both the EUR and JPY, while remaining relatively stable against the CNY, reflecting broader currency market dynamics and possibly the impact of trade negotiations and differing central bank policies.
