Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching a peak towards the latter part of the day, which is indicative of a typical diurnal pattern. Humidity levels have shown a steady decline throughout this period, suggesting an influx of drier air into the region. Air pressure has been on a slight downward trend, which could be associated with a weakening high-pressure system in the area. Wind speeds have remained relatively constant with only minor fluctuations, while the wind direction has been predominantly northerly, with slight variations toward the north-northwest. These conditions, with stable wind patterns and decreasing humidity, may lead to comfortable and clear weather for Houston in the near term.
