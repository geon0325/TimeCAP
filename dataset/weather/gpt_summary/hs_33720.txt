Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature from a daytime high to a cooler nighttime low, which is typical of the diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels have shown an inverse correlation with temperature, increasing as temperatures fell during the night and decreasing as temperatures rose, indicative of the capacity of air to hold moisture being dependent on temperature. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight decreasing trend throughout the period, which could suggest the approach of a weather system that may affect local conditions. Wind speeds were consistently light, with a subtle increase towards the end of the period, while the wind direction varied, suggesting a shift in weather patterns that may influence future weather conditions. These indicators point towards a generally stable weather pattern, but with the decreasing pressure and changing wind directions, there may be potential for weather changes in the near future.
