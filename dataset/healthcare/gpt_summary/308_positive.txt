Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant increase in the number of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the ratio of positive tests rising from a low of 0.05% to a peak of 6.23%, before declining to 2.06% in the most recent week. The majority of positive cases have been attributed to Influenza A, which saw its ratio of positive specimens surge to 6.17% in the 16th week from a mere 0.03% at the beginning of the period, indicating a dominant and more prevalent strain. Despite the increase in positive specimens, the proportion of Influenza B has remained relatively stable with only slight fluctuations, suggesting a consistent but less aggressive spread. The peak in positive tests corresponds with a substantial increase in the number of specimens tested, reaching a high of 150,872 in the 19th week, reflecting heightened surveillance and possibly greater community transmission during this period. The recent decline in positive specimen ratios could indicate a waning of the influenza season, but continued vigilance is necessary as healthcare systems manage the tail end of the outbreak and prepare for potential future surges.
