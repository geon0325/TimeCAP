Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperature has shown slight variations, generally maintaining a steady and cool state, with a subtle warming trend observed in the latter part of the day. Humidity levels remained relatively stable, with a notable increase towards the end of the observed period, suggesting the potential for increased cloud cover or the approach of a weather front. Air pressure experienced a gradual decrease throughout the day, indicating a possible change in weather patterns, such as the approach of a low-pressure system that could result in unsettled weather. Wind speeds varied, with a trend of increasing velocity, and the wind direction was predominantly from the south to southeast, but with some variability, including periods of calm. This combination of dropping air pressure, increasing humidity, and variable winds could suggest that the region might be on the cusp of a transition to more dynamic weather conditions.
