Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have experienced a gradual decline through the night and early morning hours, followed by a significant rise during the day, suggesting a typical diurnal pattern with cooler nights and warmer days. Humidity levels showed fluctuations but remained high for most of the period, which could indicate a presence of moisture in the air, potentially leading to fog or mist, especially during the early hours. Air pressure experienced a marked increase midday, which often suggests the arrival of fair weather, although there were instances of sudden drops that could signal short-term changes in weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally moderate to light, and even calm at times, with the most substantial winds occurring at the beginning of the period; this could affect the dispersal of any fog or mist that had formed. Wind direction varied significantly, with prevailing westerly winds transitioning to northerly and easterly directions, which may influence local temperature and fog patterns depending on the origin of the air masses.
