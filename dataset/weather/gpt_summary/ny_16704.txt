Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a gradual decline in temperature followed by a rebound later in the day, which indicates a typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels showed a slight increase during the cooler early hours but decreased as temperatures rose, suggesting an inverse relationship between temperature and humidity during this period. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with a slight upward trend, which is often associated with fair weather conditions. Wind speeds varied moderately, with a noticeable decrease in speed as the day progressed, indicating less turbulent atmospheric conditions. The wind direction shifted significantly from primarily northwest to northeast and then to easterly directions by the end of the period, which could bring different air masses and potentially affect the city's weather patterns.
