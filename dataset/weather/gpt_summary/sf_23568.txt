Over the last 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have experienced slight fluctuations, generally maintaining a narrow range that indicates a stable weather pattern with no extreme variations. Humidity levels showed a significant increase overnight, reaching saturation, which could have led to foggy conditions or dew; however, humidity decreased somewhat during the day. Air pressure remained consistently high throughout the period, suggesting a period of settled weather without any significant frontal systems impacting the area. Wind speeds were light and fairly constant, which, combined with the high humidity levels, could have contributed to a sense of stillness and potential for air stagnation. Wind direction was primarily from the west to northwest, which is typical for San Francisco's coastal climate and can influence temperature and fog patterns near the bay.
