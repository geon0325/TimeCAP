Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates an increasing trend in the mortality ratio of deaths from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to total deaths, surpassing the 20-week average of 7.84% in the latter half of the period. Initially, the mortality ratio was hovering above the average, with fluctuations between 8.15% and 8.54% in the first five weeks. However, there was a noticeable decrease to below-average levels, reaching a low of 5.91% in week 14. This downward trend subsequently reversed, with a sharp increase in the mortality ratio, culminating at 12.71% in week 20, which is significantly higher than the average and suggests a worsening situation. The number of deaths from pneumonia showed a dramatic increase in the final weeks, rising from 3,384 in week 14 to 8,489 in week 20, which could strain healthcare resources and warrants further investigation into the causes of this surge.
