Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, which started from a cold early morning to a considerably warmer evening, indicating a typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly throughout the day, with higher humidity in the early hours which then decreased around midday, and eventually saw a rise towards the evening, suggesting variable conditions that could affect comfort levels. Air pressure showed a general downward trend, which could be indicative of a changing weather system moving into the area. Wind speeds remained mostly light, with a slight increase in the afternoon, and the wind direction was variable, although predominantly from the north-northeast, except for a few shifts to the west and southwest. These indicators suggest calm weather but with the potential for development of weather systems given the dropping air pressure and the shifts in wind direction.
