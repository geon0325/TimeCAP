Over the past 24 hours in New York City, the temperature has experienced a natural diurnal cycle with a gradual increase through the day before cooling down at night. Humidity levels have fluctuated significantly, reaching saturation during the early morning hours, which could have led to foggy conditions, and then decreased during the day, indicating a likelihood of clearer skies. Air pressure has been relatively stable, but there has been a slight decreasing trend, which may suggest an approaching weather system that could change current conditions. Wind speeds have been mostly light with occasional calm periods, and the predominant wind direction has been from the southeast, with some variability. Overall, the stable pressure and light winds have likely contributed to a period of calm weather, although the slight pressure decrease could be an indicator of changes to come.
