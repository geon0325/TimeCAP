Over the last 20 weeks, the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza has fluctuated, averaging 6.26%, yet the trend in the most recent weeks suggests a slight increase from the preceding weeks' lower percentages. Influenza B has consistently shown a higher incidence rate in positive specimens than Influenza A, with the exception of the last week where they are nearly equivalent. The overall positive ratio has seen a decrease from earlier highs of 0.21% to lows of 0.07%, but it has rebounded in the last two weeks to 0.15%. Although Influenza A's positive ratio has varied, it peaked at 0.08% in the penultimate week, which is the highest value for this strain over the 20-week period. The healthcare system should take note of these trends and prepare for potential increases in flu cases, ensuring adequate resources for testing and treatment are available.
