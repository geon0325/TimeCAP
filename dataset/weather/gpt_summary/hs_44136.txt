Over the last 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature, with values peaking during the day and dropping towards the early hours of the morning, a common diurnal pattern. Humidity levels have shown a decreasing trend, particularly during the daytime hours, which, when coupled with rising temperatures, suggests an increasingly uncomfortable level of mugginess. Air pressure has remained relatively stable with only slight variations, indicating a period of steady weather conditions without significant frontal activity. Wind speeds have varied modestly, with a few instances of higher gusts interspersed; these changes in wind speed could influence local temperature feels and dispersion of humidity. The predominant wind direction has been generally northerly, with occasional shifts, which might influence any incoming weather systems and their potential impact on the region.
