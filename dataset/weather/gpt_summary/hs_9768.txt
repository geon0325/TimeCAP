Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature from earlier values, reaching its lowest point during the early morning hours before steadily climbing again in the afternoon. Humidity levels have shown a notable decline over the day, indicating drier air moving into the area. Air pressure has remained relatively high but showed a slight decrease in the latter part of the time period, which could suggest a weakening of the current high-pressure system. Wind speeds have been mostly gentle and have decreased slightly, with variable wind directions indicating no dominant weather front influencing the area. The combination of decreasing humidity and high but slightly falling air pressure could lead to stable but potentially cooler weather conditions in the near term for Houston.
