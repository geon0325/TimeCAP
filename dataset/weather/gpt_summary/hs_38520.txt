Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has experienced a diurnal cycle with a warming trend during the daytime and a cooling trend overnight. Humidity levels have shown significant fluctuations, reaching a peak suggestive of possible early morning fog or dew, which then decreased during the day, indicating drier conditions. Atmospheric pressure has been on a gradual decline, potentially signaling an approaching weather system that could bring changes such as precipitation or wind. Speaking of wind, there has been a steady increase in wind speed throughout the period, culminating in stronger winds more recently, while the wind direction has generally oscillated between southerly and southeasterly, which is typical for this region and could be contributing to the warmer temperatures observed. Overall, these indicators suggest variable weather, with a trend towards warmer and windier conditions, possibly preceding a change in weather patterns due to the decreasing pressure.
