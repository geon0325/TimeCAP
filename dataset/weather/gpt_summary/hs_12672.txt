Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable diurnal temperature variation, where temperatures peaked in the late afternoon before gradually decreasing throughout the night and early morning hours. Humidity levels followed an inverse pattern to temperature, increasing during the cooler night and early morning hours and decreasing as temperatures rose. Air pressure has shown a slight but steady decline throughout the period, which could indicate a gradual approach of a weather system that may affect atmospheric stability. Wind speeds varied, with a general increase observed during the afternoon, which could contribute to a dispersion of humidity and potentially influence the development of cloud cover or precipitation. The wind direction remained predominantly southerly, with slight variations, suggesting a consistent weather pattern influenced by the region's typical wind circulation.
