Over the last 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching a peak during the late afternoon before starting to cool down slightly in the evening. Humidity levels have shown variability, with a noticeable decrease in the afternoon, which could be associated with the rise in temperature, followed by a rise in the evening as temperatures began to drop. Air pressure has been on a steady decline throughout the period, suggesting a potential change in weather patterns, possibly leading to increased cloudiness or precipitation. Wind speeds have been mostly gentle to moderate with some increase towards the current hour, while wind direction has been predominantly southwesterly, with slight variations, indicating a consistent weather pattern influenced by a southwesterly air flow. The combination of falling air pressure, rising humidity, and increasing wind speed towards the latest hours could signal an approaching weather system that may affect the city's conditions in the near term.
