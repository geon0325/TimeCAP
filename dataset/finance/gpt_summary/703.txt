Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 exhibited a generally upward trend with a slight pullback towards the end, closing marginally higher than its starting point. The VIX, or Fear Index, followed a relatively stable path with minor fluctuations, ending slightly higher, indicating a small increase in market volatility. In international markets, the Nikkei 225 showed some volatility but maintained an overall upward trajectory, while the FTSE 100 ended notably higher, suggesting growing investor confidence in UK equities. Gold and Crude Oil futures both increased in price, with Gold showing a more consistent rise, which could signal a hedge against inflation or economic uncertainty. Currency exchange rates for EUR/USD and USD/CNY remained mostly flat, while the USD/JPY experienced a slight depreciation, which could affect multinational earnings and export dynamics.
