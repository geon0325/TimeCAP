Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to total deaths has exhibited a decreasing trend, starting at 8.42% and ending at 5.93%, which is below the average ratio of 7.84%. This decline suggests an improvement in the management or seasonal reduction of these respiratory illnesses. However, the total number of deaths fluctuated without a clear trend, with the highest reported deaths in the first week (59,293) and the lowest in the 14th week (53,070). The number of deaths specifically from influenza decreased significantly from 373 to 23, indicating a substantial reduction in influenza-related mortality during the period. Meanwhile, pneumonia-related deaths also showed a downward trend, but with a less steep decline from 4,621 to 3,019, remaining a more consistent concern for healthcare providers.
