Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, indicating a warming trend that culminated in noticeably higher temperatures by the end of the time series. Humidity levels were consistently high, starting at very humid conditions and slightly decreasing towards the end of the period, which could have contributed to a muggy feeling in the air. Air pressure showed some variability with a significant rise midway through the period, followed by a decrease and another rise towards the end, suggesting dynamic atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds remained relatively light and constant throughout the day, offering little relief from the humidity. The wind direction was predominantly from the north-northwest, but it exhibited some variability, including a brief shift to a southerly and easterly direction, which can influence local weather patterns, particularly temperature and humidity levels.
