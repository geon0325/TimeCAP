Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a noticeable dip in temperature followed by a significant warming trend, suggesting a transient cool period before a return to warmer conditions. Humidity levels varied widely, with a peak that likely coincided with the lowest temperatures, indicating a possible early morning fog or dew. Air pressure showed a general decreasing trend over the period, which could signal an approaching weather system or front. Wind speeds were mostly gentle to moderate, with occasional increases that might have contributed to wind chill during cooler hours. The wind direction varied but predominantly came from the south-east, which is typical for Houston and may have been responsible for bringing in moisture and influencing the fluctuating humidity levels.
