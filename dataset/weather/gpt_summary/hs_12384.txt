Over the past 24 hours, the temperature in Houston exhibited a typical diurnal pattern, peaking during the daytime and dropping to its lowest point toward the early morning hours. Humidity levels remained high throughout the day, consistent with Houston's subtropical climate, which could contribute to a muggy feeling and possibly the formation of early morning fog or dew. Atmospheric pressure experienced a slight but steady decline, which may indicate an approaching weather system that could lead to changing weather conditions in the near future. Wind speeds varied moderately but generally maintained a gentle to moderate breeze, with occasional higher gusts observed. The wind direction was predominantly from the south to southeast, which is typical for this region and can bring in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, potentially affecting cloud cover and precipitation chances.
