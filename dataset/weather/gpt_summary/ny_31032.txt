Over the last 24 hours, New York City experienced a gradual rise in temperature from early morning, reaching a peak in the late afternoon before beginning to decrease toward the evening. Concurrently, there was a significant drop in relative humidity, suggesting an influx of drier air into the region. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with a slight drop during the afternoon hours, potentially indicating a transient high-pressure system influencing the area. Wind speeds were generally light, with a slight increase later in the day, while wind direction varied, predominantly coming from the south and shifting towards the north later on, which could have contributed to the temperature rise during the day. This combination of increasing temperatures, low humidity, and stable pressure conditions points towards calm and clear weather for New York City in the immediate future.
