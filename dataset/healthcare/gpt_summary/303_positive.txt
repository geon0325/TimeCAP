Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable increase in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a steady rise from 0.08% in the first week to 4.05% in the last week, exceeding the 20-week average of 6.26%. Influenza A has shown a significant surge, with the ratio of positive specimens jumping from 0.04% to 4.00% by the end of the period, signaling a possible outbreak. The number of specimens testing positive for Influenza B has also increased but at a slower rate, with the ratio fluctuating around 0.05% in the last week. This upward trend suggests an escalating burden on the healthcare system, potentially requiring increased resource allocation for testing, treatment, and prevention efforts. The sharp rise in Influenza A cases, in particular, could indicate the need for public health interventions to mitigate spread and impact.
