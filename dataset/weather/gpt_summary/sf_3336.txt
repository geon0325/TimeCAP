Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperature demonstrated a typical diurnal pattern with a decrease during the overnight hours, reaching its lowest point around sunrise, and then gradually increasing during the day. Humidity levels fluctuated, with higher values recorded during the cooler early morning hours and a noticeable decrease as temperatures rose, indicative of the inverse relationship between temperature and relative humidity. Air pressure experienced a slight but steady decline throughout the period, which could suggest a gradual shift in weather patterns or the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds were mostly moderate but showed significant variability, including a brief period of calm conditions, followed by a return to higher speeds toward the end of the 24-hour period. The prevailing wind direction was mostly westerly, with occasional shifts, possibly affecting coastal weather conditions such as fog and marine layer development.
