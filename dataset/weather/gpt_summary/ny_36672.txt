Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature with a general trend of cooling towards the early hours, followed by a gradual warming. Humidity levels saw significant variation, reaching saturation during some periods, suggesting the likelihood of fog or mist formation, especially when coinciding with cooler temperatures. Air pressure has been decreasing modestly, which could indicate an approaching weather system with the potential for changing weather conditions. Wind speeds varied from light to moderate breezes and were predominantly from the west, with occasional shifts in direction. The variability in humidity and air pressure, along with the consistent wind direction, may suggest the presence of a frontal system impacting the local weather.
