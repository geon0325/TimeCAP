Over the last 24 hours in Houston, the temperature exhibited a gradual increase, indicating a warming trend as the day progressed. Relative humidity levels showed an inverse relationship with temperature, starting higher during the cooler early hours and decreasing significantly as temperatures peaked, which is characteristic of diurnal variation. Atmospheric pressure experienced a slight but steady decrease throughout the period, which could suggest a potential change in weather patterns or the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate and increased slightly toward the end of the period, with winds predominantly coming from northerly directions, shifting between northeast and northwest. The consistency in wind direction and the gradual increase in wind speed may influence the dispersion of air pollutants and contribute to changes in local weather conditions.
