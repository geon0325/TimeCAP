Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable decline in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for both influenza A and B, with the overall positivity rate decreasing from a peak of 19.77% to 2.16%. The number of specimens tested for influenza has also decreased, suggesting a decline in the prevalence or a reduced number of individuals seeking testing. Influenza A has shown a consistent decrease in positivity from 13.86% to 1.24%, while influenza B exhibited an initial increase peaking at 10.56% before declining to 0.92%. This downward trend in influenza positivity rates indicates a potential easing of the influenza season, which could lessen the burden on healthcare resources. However, continued surveillance is necessary to monitor for any changes in trends, especially considering possible seasonal fluctuations or the emergence of new influenza strains.
