Over the last 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have shown a gradual increase during the day, reaching their peak in the late afternoon before stabilizing somewhat during the night. Humidity levels have experienced significant fluctuations, starting moderate, increasing to very high values, and then dropping sharply during the hottest part of the day, indicating a possible discomfort due to mugginess followed by drier conditions. Air pressure has remained relatively steady with only minor variations, suggesting stable atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds have varied moderately, with periods of calmer winds interspersed with occasional gustier conditions, which could impact outdoor activities and small watercraft operations. The wind direction has been predominantly southerly, with some variability, which is typical for Houston and may contribute to the transport of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, affecting local humidity levels.
