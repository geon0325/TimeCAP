Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak during the later hours of the day before cooling down slightly. Humidity levels started moderately, increased during the cooler morning hours, and then significantly dropped as temperatures rose, suggesting the presence of drier air moving into the area. Air pressure showed a notable dip during the day, followed by a gradual increase, indicating a potential transient weather system passing through the region. Wind speeds remained consistently light throughout the period, which would have had minimal impact on the dispersion of temperature and humidity. Wind direction varied, with a shift to northerly winds during the peak temperature time, which may have contributed to the influx of warmer, drier conditions.
