Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the highest positivity rate observed in week 1 (8.16%) and the lowest in week 19 (0.49%). The majority of positive specimens were for Influenza A, which peaked at 8.39% in week 2 and then trended downwards to a low of 0.42% in week 16, before a slight uptick to 0.72% in week 20. In contrast, Influenza B accounted for a significantly smaller proportion of the positives, maintaining a fairly steady but minor presence throughout the period, never exceeding 0.08%. The overall downward trend in positivity rate suggests a decrease in influenza activity, which could lead to a reduction in influenza-associated hospitalizations and healthcare resource utilization. However, the slight increase in both types of influenza in the last few weeks suggests the need for continued surveillance to monitor for potential upticks in activity.
