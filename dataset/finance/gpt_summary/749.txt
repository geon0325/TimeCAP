Over the past 20 market days, the S&P 500 has experienced a downward trend, declining from a high of 4791.19 to 4532.76, indicating a potential shift toward a bearish market sentiment. Volatility, as measured by the VIX, has shown an overall increase, moving from 21.01 to 23.85, which could signal increased market uncertainty and investor anxiety. International markets have seen mixed movements; the Nikkei 225 faced a significant drop, particularly in the latter days, suggesting weakening confidence in the Asian markets, while the FTSE 100 showed modest growth, hinting at resilience in the UK market. Commodity prices for Gold and Crude Oil Futures both rose, with Gold climbing from 1787.90 to 1843.10 and Crude Oil from 71.12 to 86.96, potentially reflecting a hedge against inflation and increased energy demand. Currency exchange rates witnessed minor fluctuations, with the Euro and Japanese Yen showing slight strength against the US Dollar towards the end, but overall remaining relatively stable.
