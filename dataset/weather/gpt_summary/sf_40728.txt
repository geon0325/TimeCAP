Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature, showing a general trend of cooling during the nighttime hours followed by a gradual warming trend during the day. Humidity levels have seen significant variation, with a notable increase during the early hours, indicative of possible morning fog or dew, then dropping to much lower levels towards the latter part of the period, which would be consistent with drier conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting steady weather patterns without the immediate approach of significant weather systems. Wind speeds varied moderately, with some hours experiencing calmer conditions and others showing increased wind activity that could influence the feel of the temperature and possibly contribute to the dispersal of any fog or humidity. The predominant wind direction was generally from the south-southwest, shifting occasionally, which is typical for coastal cities like San Francisco and can affect the microclimates within the region.
