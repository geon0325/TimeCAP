Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual decrease in temperature which later rebounded, suggesting a typical diurnal cycle with cooler conditions overnight transitioning to warmer daytime temperatures. Humidity levels varied significantly, starting high, decreasing sharply during the day, and then moderately increasing again at night, indicative of moisture fluctuations possibly due to changing wind patterns and temperature variations. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with only minor fluctuations, suggesting a stable atmospheric condition that did not contribute to any significant weather events in the period. Wind speeds showed variability, with a period of calm conditions and then an increase towards the end of the period, which could lead to changes in weather patterns, including the potential for fog dispersal or development along the coast. The wind direction was predominantly from the west with some variability, which is typical for coastal San Francisco and can influence the marine layer's movement affecting local temperatures and cloud cover.
