Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have shown minor fluctuations within a narrow range, suggesting stable weather conditions. Humidity levels remained high throughout the period, which may contribute to a feeling of mugginess and possibly lead to morning fog given the city's coastal location. Air pressure has experienced a slight downward trend, which could indicate an approaching weather system with the potential to change current conditions. Wind speeds have seen a gradual increase, while the wind direction has remained fairly consistent, suggesting a persistent weather pattern from the same general direction. Overall, the weather in San Francisco has been steady with no extreme changes, but the slight increase in wind speed and decrease in air pressure warrant monitoring for any potential incoming systems.
