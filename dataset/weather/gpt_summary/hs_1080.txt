Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a notable fluctuation in temperature, with a significant drop followed by a sharp increase, suggesting a transient weather system passing through the area. Humidity levels experienced a corresponding inverse trend, decreasing as temperatures rose later in the period, indicative of drier air masses moving into the region. Air pressure remained relatively stable after an initial increase, which could signal a period of steady weather conditions in the near term. Wind speeds were generally low, increasing slightly but remaining light, which would have minimal impact on dispersing atmospheric pollutants, potentially affecting air quality. Wind direction shifted from calm to a northeasterly direction and then stabilized from the northeast, which is typical for weather patterns influenced by the Gulf of Mexico.
