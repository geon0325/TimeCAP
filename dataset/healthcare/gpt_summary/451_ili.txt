Over the past 20 weeks, there has been an increasing trend in the proportion of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases among all patients, with the ratio of ILI patients starting at 1.98% and reaching a peak of 6.90% in the penultimate week, far exceeding the 2.9% threshold for severity. The age group with the most significant rise in ILI incidence is the 5-24 age group, which saw an increase from 14,664 to 48,218 cases, suggesting a potential strain on resources for schools and pediatric healthcare services. The oldest age group (65 and over) also experienced a steady increase in ILI cases, indicating increased risks for complications and higher demands for geriatric care. The highest ratio of ILI patients in the last week analyzed is 4.75%, still above the severity benchmark, indicating that the healthcare system may continue to face pressure from ILI cases. With the ILI rates consistently surpassing the severity threshold for several weeks, it is imperative for healthcare providers to maintain heightened surveillance and response strategies to manage the increased patient load and prevent further spread.
