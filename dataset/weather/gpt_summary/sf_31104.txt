Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a notable diurnal temperature variation with cooler temperatures in the early morning hours followed by a gradual increase as the day progressed. Humidity levels have shown significant fluctuations, with particularly high levels in the early hours, which then dropped sharply during the day, suggesting the presence of morning moisture that dissipated as temperatures rose. Air pressure has been relatively stable but showed a slight declining trend, which could indicate an approaching weather system or front. Wind speeds have been mostly gentle to light, with occasional moderate gusts, and wind directions have varied, with a general trend from southerly to westerly directions. These conditions, especially when considering the humidity and air pressure trends, may suggest the potential for changing weather patterns, possibly leading to increased cloudiness or a chance of precipitation in the near future.
