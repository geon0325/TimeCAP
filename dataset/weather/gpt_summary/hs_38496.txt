Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature exhibited a typical diurnal pattern with a cool early morning that gradually warmed through the day, peaking in the late afternoon before cooling again in the evening. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, starting relatively low, increasing during the night and early morning, and then decreasing again in the afternoon, suggesting the presence of a moisture cycle likely influenced by local atmospheric conditions. Air pressure showed a slight decreasing trend which could be indicative of a changing weather system that may affect the area. Wind speeds were generally light with some variability, and the predominant wind direction shifted throughout the day, suggesting the influence of local weather systems on wind patterns. Overall, the combination of falling air pressure, high peak temperatures, and variable humidity levels point to unstable weather conditions that could potentially lead to the development of new weather patterns in the near future.
