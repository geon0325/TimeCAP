Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures exhibited a typical diurnal pattern, starting and ending at similar values with a noticeable peak during the daytime, indicating a warm and sunny day. Humidity levels varied inversely with temperature, with higher humidity present during the cooler early morning and late evening hours, which could have contributed to morning and evening mist or fog in some areas. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, suggesting a period of settled weather without significant frontal activity. Wind speed generally decreased towards the middle of the day, reaching its lowest point and then increasing again, which could have implications for air quality and dispersion of pollutants. The wind direction showed variability, predominantly coming from the west and shifting to a northerly component at times, which is typical for coastal San Francisco weather patterns and may influence coastal fog development.
