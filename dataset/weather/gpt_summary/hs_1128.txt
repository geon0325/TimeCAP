Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, with the warmest conditions occurring in the late afternoon before cooling slightly in the evening. Humidity levels showed a noticeable decline throughout the day, starting higher in the early hours and reaching the lowest values during the warmer afternoon period. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight increasing trend towards the middle of the day, suggesting stable weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally light with a few calm periods, and while there was some variability, the prevailing winds were predominantly from the north and northeast, shifting to easterly directions later on. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and stable pressure indicates fair weather conditions, although the light and variable winds suggest minimal air movement, which could lead to a feeling of stuffiness during the warmer parts of the day.
