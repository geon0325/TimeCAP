Over the past 20 weeks, the total number of respiratory specimens tested for influenza has generally decreased, starting from 12,822 specimens in week 1 to 6,543 in week 20. Despite fluctuations, the percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza has remained below the 20-week average of 6.26%, with the highest positivity rate observed in week 9 at 0.38% and the lowest in week 15 at 0.13%. Influenza A showed a decreasing trend in positivity rates, with a slight increase in recent weeks, while Influenza B demonstrated more variability with notable peaks in positivity in weeks 3, 7, and 19. The concurrent decrease in overall testing volume and the low positivity rates suggest a subdued influenza activity during this period. These trends indicate a lower burden on healthcare resources for influenza, but continued surveillance is essential to monitor for potential upticks in activity.
