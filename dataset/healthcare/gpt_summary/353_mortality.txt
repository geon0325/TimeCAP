Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in the mortality due to Influenza or Pneumonia as a percentage of total deaths, with a low of 6.06% and peaking at 9.15%, exceeding the 20-week average of 7.84%. The data indicates an upward trend in the ratio of deaths attributable to Influenza or Pneumonia, climbing steadily from 6.06% in the first week to a high of 9.15% in week 12, followed by a modest decline to 7.01% by week 20. The total number of deaths remained relatively stable, with minor variations, suggesting that the observed changes in the ratio are primarily driven by variations in the number of deaths from Influenza or Pneumonia. The absolute number of deaths from Influenza peaked at week 9 with 1,028 deaths, while those from Pneumonia peaked at week 11 with 5,428 deaths, indicating specific periods where the healthcare system was under increased pressure. The decline in the ratio and absolute numbers of deaths from Influenza and Pneumonia towards the last reported weeks may suggest a relative easing of the burden on healthcare resources from these causes, but continuous monitoring is necessary to confirm this trend.
