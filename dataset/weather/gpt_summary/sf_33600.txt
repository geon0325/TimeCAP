Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have experienced a moderate fluctuation, displaying a gradual decrease through the night followed by a warming trend during the day, reaching their peak in the late afternoon. Humidity levels remained relatively stable, starting high in the early hours, slightly decreasing midday, and then increasing again towards the evening, which is typical of coastal climates and can contribute to a perception of cooler mornings and evenings. Air pressure showed more variation with a significant drop midday, which could indicate the passage of a weather front or the development of a low-pressure system in the region, potentially leading to changes in weather conditions such as increased wind speeds or precipitation. Wind speeds varied throughout the day, with a notable increase around the morning, which could disperse pollutants and contribute to air quality changes. Wind direction was predominantly from the west, which is characteristic of the maritime influence on San Francisco's weather, bringing in moisture and affecting coastal temperatures.
