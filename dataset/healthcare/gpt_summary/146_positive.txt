Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable increase in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the ratio of positive specimens rising from 1.00% to 6.23%, indicating a significant upward trend in influenza activity. Influenza A has been the predominant strain, with its positivity rate increasing more sharply from 0.71% to 5.71%, compared to Influenza B's increase from 0.28% to 0.52%. The peak in the ratio of positive specimens for Influenza A at 5.71% in the final week coincides with the highest number of specimens tested, suggesting a possible surge in influenza cases that could strain healthcare resources. Despite the overall average positivity being 6.26%, the recent weeks have shown an escalation beyond this average, indicating a possible ongoing outbreak. This trend necessitates increased vigilance and potentially expanded healthcare resources to manage the rising incidence of influenza infections.
