Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a general uptrend, increasing from 3951.57 to 4151.32, reflecting investor confidence or a reaction to positive economic signals. Correspondingly, the VIX, a measure of market volatility, has declined from 24.15 to 16.95, suggesting a decrease in investor anxiety and market risk perception. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 indices have both risen, indicating a positive sentiment in Asian and European markets, with the FTSE 100 reaching a new high of 7879.50 from its starting point of 7403.90. Gold Futures have experienced volatility with an initial dip from 1979.20 to 1938.00 before recovering and crossing the 2000 mark, highlighting its status as a potential safe-haven asset amidst market fluctuations. Crude Oil Futures have seen a significant increase from 67.64 to 80.83, which could signal increasing energy demand or supply-side constraints, and this uptick in oil prices may contribute to inflationary pressures globally.
