Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, with a peak of 15.78% in week 9, significantly higher than the average ratio of 7.84%. This spike coincides with a substantial increase in overall deaths, reaching a high of 78,946 in the same week. The data indicates a declining trend in both pneumonia and influenza deaths following the peak, with pneumonia consistently contributing more to the mortality ratio than influenza. Despite this decline, the mortality ratio from these causes has remained above the average in 15 out of the 20 weeks observed. This sustained elevation could indicate a strain on healthcare resources and highlights the need for continued monitoring and possibly increased healthcare interventions for respiratory illnesses.
