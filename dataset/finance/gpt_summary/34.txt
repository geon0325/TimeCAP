Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 index has shown a general uptrend, moving from 2774.88 to 2824.23, indicating a bullish market sentiment. The VIX, commonly known as the market's fear gauge, has fluctuated within a narrow range, beginning at 14.46 and ending at 13.91, suggesting a relatively stable volatility environment in the equity markets. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have also demonstrated an upward trajectory, with the Nikkei 225 recovering from a dip to 21025.56 and the FTSE 100 showing a significant rise in the latter days, indicating positive global market sentiment.

Commodity prices have seen mixed movements; Gold Futures oscillated but ended slightly lower at 1300.50, reflecting some investor uncertainty and a potential hedge against market risks, while Crude Oil Futures have consistently increased from 56.96 to 59.83, which could signify expectations of growing demand or concerns over supply constraints. Exchange rates experienced minor fluctuations with the EUR/USD pair and USD/CNY pair showing relative stability, closing marginally higher, and the USD/JPY pair remaining relatively steady, ending the 20-day period almost unchanged, which indicates a stabilization in currency markets amidst the other market trends observed.
