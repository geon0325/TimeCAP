Over the past 20 weeks, the proportion of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases among total patients has consistently remained below the benchmark of 2.9%. The highest ratio of ILI patients was 2.67% in week 3, with a downward trend reaching the lowest point of 1.53% in week 14, indicating a decrease in ILI incidence during the timeframe. However, the last six weeks have shown a slight uptick in the ILI ratio, increasing from 1.52% to 2.20%, which suggests a potential resurgence of ILI cases. Age-specific analysis reveals that the highest number of ILI cases is consistently found in the 5-24 age group, while the 65 or more age group has the lowest. The overall trend suggests that while the ILI situation has remained relatively stable and below the severity threshold, recent increases warrant close monitoring to manage and mitigate potential healthcare system impacts.
