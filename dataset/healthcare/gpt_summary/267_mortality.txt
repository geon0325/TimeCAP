The data indicates a decreasing trend in the proportion of deaths attributed to influenza and pneumonia over the last 20 weeks, declining from a peak of 13.00% to the current rate of 6.06%. Despite this trend, the actual mortality rate from these illnesses remains above the 20-week average of 7.84%, suggesting a persistent and significant impact on overall mortality. The total number of deaths has fluctuated, with a slight downward trend from the initial count of 70,910 to the most recent figure of 58,010. The number of deaths specifically from influenza has decreased significantly in the last two weeks, dropping to nearly half of what was reported at the beginning of the time series. This data could imply a reduction in the severity or spread of influenza, but the consistent mortality from pneumonia demands continued attention from the healthcare system to manage and mitigate its impact.
