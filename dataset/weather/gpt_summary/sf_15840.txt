Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have shown a gradual increase with slight fluctuations, peaking during the latter part of the observed period. Humidity levels have decreased overall, starting higher and ending lower, which is indicative of drier air moving into the region. Air pressure has been slowly decreasing, suggesting a possible change in weather patterns or the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds have significantly dropped and remained low throughout most of the period, with winds coming predominantly from the west, shifting slightly throughout the day. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and falling air pressure, coupled with steady wind patterns, suggests a stable weather situation with a potential for warmer and drier conditions in the near future.
