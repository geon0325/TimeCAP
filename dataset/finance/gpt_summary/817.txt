Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has experienced a downward trend, dropping from 4602.45 to 4183.96, indicating a potential bearish sentiment among investors. Volatility, as measured by the VIX, has increased significantly, peaking at 33.52, which correlates with the instability in the equity markets. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 have similarly shown declines, with the Nikkei 225 dropping from 28027.25 to 26386.63 and the FTSE 100 decreasing from 7578.80 to 7425.60, reflecting broader global market concerns. Gold futures have seen minor fluctuations but ultimately decreased from 1933.50 to 1885.90, suggesting investors might not be fully turning to traditional safe havens amidst this volatility. Exchange rates have seen the USD appreciating against major currencies, with the EUR/USD dropping from 1.11 to 1.06 and the USD/CNY increasing from 6.36 to 6.56, which may indicate a flight to the perceived safety of the dollar during times of market stress.
