Over the last 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures experienced a modest fluctuation, with a noticeable dip overnight before rising again during the day. Humidity levels were relatively high throughout, peaking in the early hours, which could have contributed to a feeling of mugginess or potential early morning fog. Air pressure remained steady with a slight increase midday, indicating stable weather conditions. Wind speeds were mostly light and variable, with a brief period of calm winds; this could have led to periods of stagnant air and potentially poor dispersion of urban pollutants. The wind direction shifted throughout the day but predominantly came from the southwest, which is typical for this region and can influence the local climate by bringing in moisture from the ocean.
