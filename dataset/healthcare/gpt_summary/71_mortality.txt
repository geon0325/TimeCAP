Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicate a slight decrease in the proportion of deaths due to Influenza or Pneumonia relative to total mortality, with the initial ratio of 5.92% dropping to 5.55%, remaining below the 20-week average of 5.54% and significantly lower than the historical average of 7.84%. The total number of deaths fluctuated with a slight increasing trend, reaching a peak of 52,001 in the fourth week and then oscillating around the 50,000 mark. The number of deaths specifically from Influenza has been markedly low, with a maximum of 43 in the first week and then declining to 14 by the last week, suggesting a minor role in overall mortality. In contrast, deaths from Pneumonia have remained consistently higher, although they too show a decreasing trend from 2,955 to 2,814 deaths. This persistent but reduced impact of Pneumonia on overall mortality suggests a continued need for healthcare resources dedicated to respiratory illnesses, but also indicates a potential improvement in preventing or managing such conditions in the population.
