Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced a mild fluctuation in temperature with a general cooling trend during the night followed by a warming trend during the day. Humidity levels showed significant variance, with notably higher humidity occurring during the cooler early morning hours and dropping considerably during the warmer afternoon. Air pressure was relatively stable, although there were slight variations, including a notable increase during the day, which could suggest the passage of a weather front. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate throughout the period, with no significant gusts, which indicates stable weather conditions. The wind direction was predominantly from the east to southeast, which is typical for Houston and can be associated with moisture-rich air coming from the Gulf of Mexico, potentially leading to cloud formation and humidity changes.
