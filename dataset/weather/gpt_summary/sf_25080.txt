Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a noticeable fluctuation in temperature, with a general cooling trend during the early hours, followed by gradual warming that peaked in the late afternoon before stabilizing. Humidity levels varied significantly, starting high, decreasing markedly towards the afternoon, and then rising again, suggesting a change in the air moisture content throughout the day that could have affected the perceived comfort level. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a minor dip, which is typical for coastal cities and suggests stable weather conditions, but any sharp changes could signal the approach of a new weather system. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate with occasional gusts, indicating an active air mass movement that could contribute to changes in weather patterns. Lastly, the wind direction varied greatly, with a predominant westerly flow, which is common for this region and could bring in maritime air, affecting local temperatures and fog conditions.
