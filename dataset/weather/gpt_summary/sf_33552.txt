Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a noticeable diurnal temperature variation with warmer temperatures observed during the day, followed by a cooling trend at night, indicative of a typical coastal climate pattern. Humidity levels were relatively high throughout the period, reaching their peak in the early hours, which could have contributed to a feeling of mugginess and possibly the development of early morning fog, a common occurrence in this region. Air pressure remained fairly stable with a slight increase midday, suggesting steady weather conditions without significant atmospheric disturbances. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a marked increase during the early hours, which might have influenced the dispersion of any fog or low clouds. The prevailing wind direction was predominantly from the west and northwest, except for a brief period of variable directions, which aligns with the common wind patterns for San Francisco, influenced by the Pacific Ocean.
