Over the last 20 weeks, the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) activity has demonstrated a fluctuating trend, with the initial weeks showing a significantly higher ratio of ILI patients exceeding the baseline, which then declined to a ratio below the baseline threshold. The number of ILI cases among all age groups peaked early and has since been on a decline, with the most considerable decrease observed in the 25-49 age group. Despite the overall reduction in ILI incidence, there has been a recent uptick in cases among the youngest age group (0-4 years), suggesting a potential shift in the affected population demographics. The age groups 50-64 and 65 or more have shown a consistent decline in ILI cases, which could alleviate some pressure on healthcare services for older populations. It is important for healthcare systems to monitor these trends closely, as the increase in ILI cases in young children may require additional resources and pediatric care, and sustained low levels in older age groups could indicate successful containment or mitigation strategies within these demographics.
