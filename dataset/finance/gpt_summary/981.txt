Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has experienced volatility with an initial increase followed by a downward trend, closing lower at 3821.62 from a high of 4080.11, indicating potential unease in the equity market. Concurrently, the VIX has generally trended upwards, peaking at 25.00, which suggests increased market uncertainty. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have also shown signs of instability, with the Nikkei 225 notably dropping from a high of 28283.03 to 26568.03, reflecting broader global market pressures. Commodity prices such as Gold Futures have risen, ending at 1815.90, which could indicate a flight to safety among investors during times of market stress. Currency exchange rates have seen the EUR/USD and USD/JPY fluctuating within a narrow band, while the USD/CNY has slightly decreased, pointing to a nuanced shift in currency markets, with the Euro and Yen showing some strength against the Dollar, while the Chinese Yuan has weakened.
