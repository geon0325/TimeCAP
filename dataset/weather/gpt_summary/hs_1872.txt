Over the last 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable diurnal temperature variation where temperatures peaked in the late afternoon and dropped to their lowest point towards the early hours of the morning. Humidity levels initially fluctuated but showed an increasing trend overnight, potentially leading to a muggier feel in the air as dawn approached. Air pressure remained relatively stable but showed a slight decrease in the later hours, which could indicate an approaching weather system or frontal boundary. Wind speeds were generally light but increased towards the evening, with a tendency for the wind to come from a southerly direction, shifting slightly to a southwesterly direction as the speeds increased. The combination of increasing humidity, decreasing pressure, and stronger winds could suggest that conditions may become unsettled, with a potential for weather changes or the development of precipitation.
