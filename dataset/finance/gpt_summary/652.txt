Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a general upward trend, increasing from 4402.66 to 4522.68, suggesting a positive sentiment among investors. Despite this increase, the VIX, a measure of market volatility, has remained relatively stable, fluctuating between 15.45 and 21.67, which indicates that investors are not significantly more concerned about short-term risks. The Nikkei 225 displayed some volatility but ended on a high note, climbing to 28089.54, indicating strength in the Japanese market. Gold futures saw a dip mid-period but recovered towards the end, closing at 1815.00, which may signal a hedge against potential market corrections or inflation concerns. Currency exchange rates against the USD have remained relatively steady for the EUR and appreciated slightly for the JPY, while the CNY/USD exchange rate has been stable, reflecting a period of relative calm in the foreign exchange markets.
