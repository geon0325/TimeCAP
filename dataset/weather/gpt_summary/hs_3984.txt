Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, culminating in a peak during the later afternoon hours, followed by a slight cooling trend toward the current hour. Humidity levels have shown significant fluctuations, reaching saturation during the early morning hours, indicative of possible fog or dew formation, then dropping to lower values in the afternoon, which is typical due to rising temperatures. Air pressure has been on a slow decrease, suggesting a potential change in weather patterns or the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds have generally been moderate, with an increase observed during the afternoon, which could contribute to a dispersal of any morning fog and aid in the mixing of the lower atmosphere. The wind direction has been predominantly southerly, which in Houston often brings in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, potentially contributing to the observed high humidity levels.
