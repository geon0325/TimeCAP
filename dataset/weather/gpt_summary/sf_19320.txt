Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a relatively stable temperature range with a slight cooling trend towards the middle of the period before warming up slightly again. Humidity levels have been consistently saturated, suggesting the presence of fog or persistent moisture in the air that could potentially affect visibility. Air pressure has been gradually decreasing after a period of stability, indicating that there might be a change in weather patterns, such as an approaching weather system. Wind speed has seen a gradual increase throughout the period, which might contribute to changes in weather conditions, such as the dispersal of fog or the arrival of a front. The wind direction has remained generally southerly with slight variations, which is typical for coastal areas like San Francisco and may influence the city's microclimate.
