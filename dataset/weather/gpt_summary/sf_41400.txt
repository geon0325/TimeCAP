Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have experienced a general cooling trend, with the warmest conditions present in the early hours, leading to a gradual decline as the day progressed into the night. Humidity levels remained high throughout the day, indicating a significant amount of moisture in the air, which could lead to a perception of mugginess and may have implications for local fog conditions, particularly during the cooler night and early morning hours. Air pressure saw some fluctuations, which could be associated with changing weather patterns, such as the movement of different air masses or the development of frontal systems in the area. Wind speed varied, with calmer conditions at times and periods of increased windiness, which might have influenced the dispersion of fog and low-level clouds. The wind direction shifted frequently, suggesting a lack of a dominant weather system and a potential for variable weather conditions in the near future.
