Over the 20-week period, there has been a notable fluctuation in the incidence of influenza with the peak ratio of positive specimens reaching 26.27% in week 9, followed by a steady decline to the current low of 1.02%. This peak corresponds to a surge in Influenza A cases, which significantly outnumbered Influenza B throughout the period, reaching a maximum of 26.15% of tested specimens compared to a maximum of 0.27% for Influenza B. The recent decrease in positive cases suggests a downward trend in influenza transmission or a transition out of the peak flu season. Despite the decrease, influenza remains a concern for the healthcare system due to its potential to cause severe illness, necessitate hospitalization, and strain healthcare resources. The consistent presence of Influenza B, although at a lower incidence, indicates continuous circulation in the population, warranting ongoing surveillance and preventive measures such as vaccination and public health education.
