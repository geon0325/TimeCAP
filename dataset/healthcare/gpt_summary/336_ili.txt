Over the last 20 weeks, the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data indicates a gradual increase in the ratio of ILI patients, surpassing the baseline of 2.9% in recent weeks. This upward trend is observed across all age groups, with the most significant rise noted among children aged 0-4 and school-aged individuals from 5-24. The persistent elevation above the baseline threshold suggests a heightened level of influenza activity, which may strain healthcare resources due to increased demand for medical attention and potential hospitalizations. Despite the overall rise, there has been a slight dip in ILI ratios in the most recent data points, indicating a possible stabilization or early signs of a downward trend. It is imperative for healthcare providers to monitor these trends closely to manage resource allocation effectively and to remain vigilant in influenza prevention and control efforts.
