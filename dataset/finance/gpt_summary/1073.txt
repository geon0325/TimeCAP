The VIX, commonly known as the fear index, has risen from 18.40 to 20.09, suggesting a growing sense of market uncertainty and risk aversion among investors. In contrast, the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have remained relatively stable with a slight upward trend, indicating localized confidence in Asian and European markets, despite global uncertainties. Gold futures have seen an overall increase from 2011.90 to 2048.00, which typically signifies a flight to safety as investors seek more stable assets amidst volatility. The crude oil futures experienced a significant decrease from 80.70 to 68.56, reflecting concerns over demand and potential economic slowdown, which could signal a bearish outlook for energy-dependent sectors.
