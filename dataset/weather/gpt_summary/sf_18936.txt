Over the past 24 hours, the temperature in San Francisco has experienced slight fluctuations but has generally remained consistent, indicating a stable weather pattern without significant warm or cool trends. Humidity levels have been exceptionally high, reaching saturation at several points, which may have led to foggy conditions, particularly in coastal and low-lying areas. Air pressure has been gradually increasing, suggesting a potential shift towards calmer and more stable weather conditions. Wind speeds have been mild to moderate with some increase in the latter part of the period, which could contribute to a slight wind chill factor and the dispersal of any coastal fog. The wind direction has varied, mostly blowing from the southeast to northeast, which is typical for the region and may influence localized weather patterns along the bay.
