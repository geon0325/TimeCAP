The VIX, a measure of market volatility, has decreased slightly from 26.82 to 21.77, indicating a modest reduction in investor anxiety. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have also demonstrated resilience, with the Nikkei 225 rebounding from a low of 26478.77 to close at 27999.96, and the FTSE 100 showing consistent growth, ending at 7488.20. Commodity prices such as Gold Futures have seen a gradual increase, closing at 1794.00, which may suggest a flight to safety or inflationary concerns among investors, while Crude Oil Futures have decreased to 90.50 from a high of 104.22, potentially reflecting concerns over global demand. The exchange rates for EUR/USD and USD/JPY have remained relatively stable with slight fluctuations, while the USD/CNY pair has seen minimal movement, indicating current stability in currency markets.
