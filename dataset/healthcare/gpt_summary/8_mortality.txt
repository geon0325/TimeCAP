Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable decline in the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia relative to total deaths, with an initial ratio of 8.37% dropping to a low of 5.58% before a slight increase to 6.11% in the final week. This trend suggests a decrease in the impact of these respiratory diseases on overall mortality, which might be attributable to seasonal variations, public health interventions, or increased immunity within the population. Despite the overall decline, the ratio remains above the average of 7.84%, indicating that Influenza or Pneumonia still constitute a significant cause of death. The total number of deaths has remained relatively stable, with a slight decrease observed from 57,256 to 49,973, which could be indicative of broader trends in public health and mortality. The sharp drop in deaths specifically from influenza—from 534 to 4—over the 20-week period is particularly noteworthy, suggesting successful containment or a natural decline of influenza cases, which could alleviate some pressure on healthcare resources.
