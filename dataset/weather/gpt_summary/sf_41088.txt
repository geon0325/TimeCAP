Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature, indicating a typical diurnal cycle with a cooler night transitioning to a warmer day. Humidity levels displayed significant variation, starting high during the early hours, decreasing substantially towards the afternoon, and then rising again, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air that could have led to morning fog dissipating into a drier afternoon. Air pressure experienced a gradual increase throughout the majority of the day, indicative of a strengthening high-pressure system, but a sudden drop towards the end of the period could suggest an approaching weather front or system. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a peak during the day, which could have helped disperse any early fog or low clouds. The wind direction was predominantly westerly but showed a notable shift to a southerly and easterly direction at times, which may have influenced the local temperature and humidity patterns.
