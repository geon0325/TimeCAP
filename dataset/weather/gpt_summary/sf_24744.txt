Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature with a general trend of cooling in the early hours followed by warming during the day and cooling again towards the evening. Humidity levels have varied significantly, indicating changing atmospheric moisture that could affect comfort levels and possibly lead to morning and evening fogginess. Air pressure has remained relatively stable with slight variations, suggesting steady weather patterns without the immediate approach of any major storm systems. Wind speeds have been moderate but showed some variability, with calmer winds at certain times which could lead to the accumulation of pollutants or fog in the absence of significant dispersion forces. The prevailing wind direction has been predominantly from the northwest, with occasional shifts, which is typical for the coastal climate of San Francisco and can influence coastal fog and temperature conditions.
