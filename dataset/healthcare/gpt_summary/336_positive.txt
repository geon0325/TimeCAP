Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable decrease in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the ratio of positive specimens declining from a peak of 9.50% to a low of 0.52%. This trend is primarily driven by a significant reduction in Influenza A positive cases, which fell from 9.45% to 0.46%, while Influenza B has remained a relatively minor component with its ratio fluctuating slightly around an average of 0.07%. The highest number of specimens tested occurred in week 9 (84,554), coinciding with the peak positive percentage for Influenza A, suggesting a potential correlation between testing volume and positive detection rates. The overall average positive specimen ratio of 6.26% across the 20 weeks indicates that influenza has been consistently present but shows a marked decline in recent weeks, which could indicate the tail end of the influenza season. Healthcare systems may experience a reduced burden from influenza cases but should remain vigilant for potential changes in the trend, especially with the easing of public health measures that could alter the dynamics of viral transmission.
