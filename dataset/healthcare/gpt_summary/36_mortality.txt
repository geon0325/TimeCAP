Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable increase in the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia relative to total deaths, beginning at 5.86% and peaking at 10.89%, significantly higher than the average ratio of 7.84%. The total number of deaths also demonstrated an upward trend, with an initial count of 51,694 escalating to a high of 67,495 before slightly decreasing to 62,780. Notably, deaths from Influenza alone surged dramatically in the last quarter of the period, from single or low double digits to a peak of 1,626. Concurrently, deaths from Pneumonia showed fluctuations but maintained a general increase from 3,021 to 5,187. These trends suggest a substantial impact on the healthcare system, likely indicating increased hospital admissions, a need for heightened public health interventions, and potential strain on healthcare resources.
