Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, followed by a significant rise towards the late afternoon, which is typical for the diurnal cycle. Humidity levels were notably high, reaching saturation during the night, indicating the possibility of fog or dew formation, which could have impacted visibility conditions. Air pressure showed a slight fluctuation but ended with a sharp increase, suggesting a potential change in weather patterns, such as the arrival of a high-pressure system which could lead to clearer skies.
