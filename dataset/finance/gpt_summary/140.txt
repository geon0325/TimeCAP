Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has experienced volatility, with an initial upward trend followed by a significant drop mid-period and a partial recovery toward the end, closing at 2900.51, which is 3.93% lower than the starting point. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, peaked at 24.59, correlating with the largest dip in the S&P 500, and despite fluctuations, ended at a heightened level of 17.50, indicating ongoing market uncertainty. Asian and European equity markets mirrored this volatility, with the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 both showing declines of 4.79% and 5.01%, respectively, over the same period, which might suggest a global risk-off sentiment. Gold Futures saw an overall increase from 1422.80 to 1504.60, reflecting investor appetite for safe-haven assets amidst market turbulence. The currency markets showed relative stability in the EUR/USD and USD/JPY pairs, but the USD/CNY pair experienced an increase, possibly due to trade tensions and the weakening of the Chinese Yuan against the US Dollar.
