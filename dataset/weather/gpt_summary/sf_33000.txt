Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have followed a typical diurnal pattern, with a noticeable increase during the daytime and a gradual decrease through the night, reaching a minimum in the early morning hours. Humidity levels showed some fluctuations but generally remained high, suggesting a presence of moisture in the air that could lead to foggy conditions, especially during the cooler nighttime and early morning hours. Air pressure was relatively stable throughout the period, with a slight decrease towards the end, which could indicate the approach of a weather system that may alter the current conditions. Wind speeds were moderate, with some increase during the day, which could help in dispersing fog and low clouds, aiding in maintaining good visibility. Lastly, the wind direction shifted predominantly from northerly in the early hours to westerly and then varied, which is typical for coastal cities like San Francisco and can influence the transportation of marine air masses inland.
