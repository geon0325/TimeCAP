Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have displayed a minor fluctuating pattern with a general trend of cooling at night and warming during the day, consistent with normal diurnal variation. Humidity levels have been high, often reaching saturation, which could lead to a feeling of mugginess and potentially contribute to fog or mist formation, especially during the early morning hours. Air pressure has been gradually decreasing, which could indicate an approaching weather system that may lead to unsettled weather conditions. Wind speeds have varied, with occasional higher gusts that may influence wind chill and make temperatures feel cooler than they actually are. The predominant wind direction has been from the south-east, which is typical for Houston and could be responsible for the transport of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, contributing to the high humidity experienced.
