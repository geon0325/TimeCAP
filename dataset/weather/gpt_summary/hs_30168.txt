Over the last 24 hours in Houston, the temperature experienced a diurnal cycle with a gradual decrease during the early morning hours, reaching its lowest point at daybreak, and then increasing towards the afternoon. Humidity levels were inversely correlated with temperature changes, peaking at 100% during the coolest part of the early morning, which may have led to early morning fog or dew. Air pressure showed a slight decreasing trend throughout the day, which could indicate the approach of a weather system capable of altering current weather patterns. Wind speeds varied moderately but were generally gentle to moderate, while wind direction shifted from southerly in the early hours to more westerly by the end of the period, suggesting a change in the weather system affecting the area. Overall, the combination of high humidity, shifting wind direction, and decreasing air pressure could lead to an increased chance of precipitation or a change in weather conditions in the near future.
