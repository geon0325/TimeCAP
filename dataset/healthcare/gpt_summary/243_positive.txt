Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates an increase in the number of respiratory specimens tested for influenza, with a notable spike from 9019 to 15112 in the final two weeks. Though the average ratio of positive specimens is 6.26%, the actual ratios fluctuated, starting below average and peaking at 0.40% in week 16, before settling closer to the average in the final weeks. The number of positive specimens for both Influenza A and B have shown an upward trend, particularly in the last four weeks, suggesting an increase in influenza activity. The ratios of positive specimens for both Influenza A and B also demonstrate a general increase over the period, with Influenza B consistently registering a slightly higher ratio of positives than Influenza A, hinting at a predominance of Influenza B cases. This rising trend in positive influenza cases could indicate a potential surge, warranting increased healthcare resources and public health measures to manage the growing influenza incidence.
