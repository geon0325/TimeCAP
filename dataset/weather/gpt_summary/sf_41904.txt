Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before a subtle decline during the evening. Concurrently, humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, with a sharp drop midday followed by a steep rise towards the night, indicating the possibility of morning fog or dew. Air pressure remained relatively stable but did exhibit minor variability, with a noticeable drop and subsequent recovery, which could have influenced local wind patterns. Wind speeds were mostly light to gentle, with a brief period of moderate winds, and the wind direction was predominantly from the southwest, shifting to westerly and then variable towards the end of the period. These indicators suggest a typical pattern of coastal weather with potential for fog formation and a mild breeze, consistent with San Francisco's maritime climate.
