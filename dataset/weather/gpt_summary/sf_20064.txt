Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have shown a slight fluctuation, with a general trend of cooling followed by a gradual warming towards the end of the period. Humidity levels remained extremely high throughout the day, approaching saturation during the middle of the time series, which could increase the likelihood of fog or mist, particularly during the early hours. Air pressure was notably stable, suggesting a period of settled weather, although a slight decrease was observed towards the end of the period, which could indicate an approaching change in weather conditions. Wind speeds were consistently light, which is typical for the region and unlikely to contribute to significant wind chill or sea state changes. Wind directions varied, with a notable shift from northeasterly to southerly and then westerly directions, which might have influenced the slight temperature changes and could also affect local coastal conditions.
