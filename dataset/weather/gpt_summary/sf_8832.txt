Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a notable increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the later hours of the day before a slight decline towards the end of the reported period. Humidity levels have seen fluctuations but remained relatively low throughout the day, suggesting dry conditions which could increase the risk of wildfires and necessitate hydration warnings for residents. Air pressure has been relatively stable with only minor variations, indicating a steady atmospheric condition that is unlikely to lead to significant weather changes in the immediate future. Wind speeds have generally been low, with occasional mild gusts, and the wind direction has been variable with shifts throughout the day, which might have contributed to a slight dispersion of urban pollutants. These conditions combined point towards a dry and calm weather pattern with warmer temperatures, typical for San Francisco's Mediterranean-type climate.
