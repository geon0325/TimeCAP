The data indicates a significant seasonal fluctuation in influenza activity, with the ratio of positive specimens peaking at 26.27% in week 6 and declining steadily to 0.89% by week 20. Influenza A has been the predominant strain throughout the 20-week period, with its highest detection rate of 25.70% in week 4 and a steep decline to 0.58% by the end of the period, suggesting a tapering off of the Influenza A season. In contrast, Influenza B has remained a minority constituent of the positive specimens, with a relatively stable but low presence, never exceeding 0.35% in any given week. The overall decline in positive specimens, particularly for the predominant Influenza A, may indicate a close to the influenza season, potentially reducing the burden on healthcare resources related to influenza cases. However, the healthcare system must remain vigilant for any unexpected changes in trends, especially considering the potential for new influenza strains and the impact on vulnerable populations.
