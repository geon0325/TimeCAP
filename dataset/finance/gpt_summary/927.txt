Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 exhibited volatility with a notable decline from 4110.41 to a low of 3585.62 before partially rebounding to 3790.93, reflecting investor uncertainty and potential market instability. Correspondingly, the VIX, a measure of market volatility, remained elevated, peaking at 32.60, which suggests increased market risk and investor caution during this period. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 also faced downward pressure but showed signs of recovery in the latter days, indicating similar global market sentiments. Gold futures rose from 1715.30 to 1721.10, traditionally a safe-haven asset, which its upward trend could be indicative of investors seeking stability amidst market fluctuation. Finally, the exchange rates for EUR/USD, USD/JPY, and USD/CNY showed relative stability with minor fluctuations, suggesting that currency markets have not reacted as sharply as equity and commodity markets to the current financial conditions.
