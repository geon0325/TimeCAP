Over the past 20 weeks, the data indicates a rising trend in the number of patients presenting with Influenza-like Illness (ILI) across all age groups, with a notable increase in the most recent weeks. The largest growth in ILI cases has been observed in the youngest (0-4 years) and school-aged (5-24 years) populations. This surge is also reflected in the overall ratio of ILI patients, which has escalated in the latter weeks, surpassing the baseline ratio that determines heightened influenza activity. Such an upward trajectory suggests an intensifying influenza season, with the potential to strain healthcare resources, particularly in pediatric care and possibly leading to broader community spread. As the ratio of ILI patients has now exceeded the threshold of concern, healthcare providers and public health agencies should prepare for increased demand for medical services and consider measures to mitigate the impact of the flu season.
