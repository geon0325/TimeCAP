Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a notable fluctuation in temperature, with a general upward trend peaking during the late afternoon hours. Humidity levels were relatively high throughout the period, starting strong and then slightly decreasing as temperatures peaked, potentially contributing to muggy conditions. Air pressure showed a gradual decline, which could be indicative of an approaching weather system or front. Wind speeds remained predominantly light, with a brief period of increased wind coinciding with the peak temperature, which may have offered some temporary relief from the heat. There was a significant shift in wind direction in the early morning, which later stabilized, suggesting the passage of a weather front or localized atmospheric changes.
