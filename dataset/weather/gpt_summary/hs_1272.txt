Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a mild and gradual decrease in temperature, indicative of a typical diurnal cycle with the warmest conditions in the afternoon, transitioning to cooler temperatures during the night and early morning hours. Humidity levels have fluctuated, peaking during the early morning hours, which, combined with cool temperatures, may have led to morning fog or dew. Atmospheric pressure has remained relatively steady and high, suggesting stable weather conditions without significant changes or the presence of strong weather fronts. Wind speeds have been mostly light but picked up significantly towards the end of the period, which could disperse humidity and lead to clearer skies. The wind direction has been variable, though predominantly from the south and southeast, shifting more northerly later on, possibly bringing in a cooler air mass into the region.
