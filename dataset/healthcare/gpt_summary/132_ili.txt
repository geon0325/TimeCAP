Over the last 20 weeks, data indicates a consistent upward trend in the number of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases across all age groups, with the most significant increases observed in the youngest (0-4 years) and school-aged children (5-24 years) populations. The ratio of ILI patients to the total number of patients has also progressively increased, surpassing the baseline threshold of 2.9% in recent weeks, suggesting a growing community spread of influenza-like infections. The marked rise in ILI cases in younger age groups could strain pediatric healthcare resources and has the potential to impact school attendance and parental work participation due to caregiving needs. The increase in ILI ratio in the older population (65 years and above) is concerning given their increased risk of complications, highlighting the need for focused preventive measures such as vaccinations and antiviral treatments for these vulnerable groups. Overall, the upward trend across all indicators underscores the necessity for public health awareness, resource allocation, and preparedness within the healthcare system to manage the rising incidence of ILI cases.
