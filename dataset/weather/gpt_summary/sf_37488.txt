Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have displayed a slight decrease, indicative of a minor cooling trend. Humidity levels have experienced some fluctuations but have generally remained high, suggesting a persistently moist air mass over the area. Air pressure readings have shown variability with a general trend towards stabilization at higher values, which could indicate the settling of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds have been moderate with some periods of higher gusts, while wind direction has been variable, oscillating between northerly and southerly directions with occasional shifts to westerly winds. This combination of humidity, stabilizing air pressure, and varying wind conditions could lead to the formation of coastal fog, a common occurrence in the San Francisco area, potentially impacting visibility and local temperatures.
