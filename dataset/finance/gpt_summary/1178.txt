Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with a general downward trend, closing lower by 4.21% from 4451.14 to 4263.75, which may indicate growing investor caution. The VIX, commonly referred to as the "fear index," has increased from 14.40 to 18.58, suggesting heightened market volatility and uncertainty among investors. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 have also experienced declines, with the Nikkei dropping significantly by 7.47% and the FTSE 100 by a more modest 0.39%, reflecting broader global market pressures. Commodity prices have seen mixed movements; Gold Futures have declined by 5.16%, indicating a possible shift away from traditional safe-haven assets, while Crude Oil Futures have seen a sharp drop of 3.05% to $84.22, which could suggest changing expectations in energy demand or supply dynamics. Currency markets have seen the USD strengthen against the JPY and CNY but remain relatively stable against the EUR, which could impact international trade and earnings of multinational corporations.
