The analysis of the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data over the last 20 weeks demonstrates a fluctuating trend in the incidence rate of ILI across different age groups. After an initial period of relative stability, there was a notable increase in the ratio of ILI patients, exceeding the baseline threshold, indicating a surge that peaked before gradually declining towards the end of the observed period. The most significant rise in ILI cases was observed among patients aged 25-49 and 5-24, suggesting these demographics were the most affected during the peak of ILI activity. While the increase in ILI cases placed additional demands on the healthcare system, the subsequent decline may suggest a return towards baseline levels, easing the strain on healthcare resources. It is important for healthcare providers to remain vigilant and monitor these trends as they could indicate the onset of an epidemic or the effectiveness of public health interventions.
