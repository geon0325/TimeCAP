Over the last 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual decline in temperature, with a slight rebound during the daytime, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, reaching saturation at certain points, which could have led to foggy conditions or precipitation, particularly when the temperature was at its lowest. The air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with a slight increase, suggesting steady weather conditions without the immediate approach of any significant weather fronts. Wind speeds were mostly light but showed an increasing trend towards the end of the period, which could contribute to a wind chill effect, making the temperatures feel cooler than they are. The wind direction was variable but predominantly came from the east to southeast, which may have brought in moisture from the Atlantic, potentially impacting cloud cover and humidity levels.
