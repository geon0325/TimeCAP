Over the past 24 hours in New York City, there has been a gradual decrease in temperature, indicative of a cooling trend. While humidity levels fluctuated, there was a notable peak suggesting possible increased cloud cover or precipitation during that time. Air pressure experienced minor fluctuations before a significant rise, potentially signaling the movement of a high-pressure system into the area. Wind speeds varied, with some higher gusts that could have contributed to a wind chill effect, making the cooler temperatures feel even colder. The wind direction was predominantly from the northwest, consistent with the arrival of cooler, drier air masses typical of that direction.
