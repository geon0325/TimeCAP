Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable decrease in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the average ratio of 7.84%, with the latest recorded ratio at 5.55%. The total number of deaths has remained relatively stable, fluctuating marginally around the 52,000 mark each week. Notably, deaths from pneumonia have consistently outnumbered those from influenza, with pneumonia accounting for a substantial proportion of the combined mortality from these respiratory conditions. The trend shows a gradual decline in the percentage of deaths attributable to Influenza or Pneumonia, reaching a low of 4.90% in week 16 before a slight uptick in recent weeks. This reduction in the mortality ratio may indicate an improvement in the management and treatment of these conditions, or a seasonal variation, but continuous monitoring is necessary to understand the underlying causes and to manage healthcare resources effectively.
