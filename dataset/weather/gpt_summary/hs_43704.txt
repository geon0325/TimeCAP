Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the weather has demonstrated a typical diurnal pattern with temperatures peaking in the late afternoon and reaching a minimum during the early morning hours. Relative humidity values inversely followed temperature trends, with the highest humidity occurring when temperatures were at their lowest, indicative of muggy conditions that are common in the region. Air pressure remained relatively steady, with only slight fluctuations that are not indicative of significant weather changes. Wind speeds were generally light, occasionally reaching moderate speeds, with the wind direction predominantly from the north-northeast, except for a brief period where the wind shifted to come from the southeast and east. The combination of high temperatures and high humidity levels suggest an uncomfortably warm and muggy day for Houston residents, with the consistent wind direction from the north-northeast providing minimal relief.
