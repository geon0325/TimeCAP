Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable decline in the overall number of patients presenting with Influenza-like Illness (ILI) across all age groups, with the most significant reductions observed in the youngest (0-4 years) and school-age (5-24 years) populations. The ratio of ILI patients to total patients has concurrently decreased, falling below the baseline threshold, which indicates a tapering of ILI activity within the population. Despite this overall decrease, the ratio has plateaued in recent weeks, suggesting a possible stabilization of ILI incidence rates. The consistent decline in ILI cases among the elderly (65 years or more) is particularly positive, as this demographic is typically at higher risk for complications from influenza. This trend may alleviate some of the burden on healthcare resources, but continued surveillance is necessary to monitor for potential fluctuations or a resurgence in ILI rates.
