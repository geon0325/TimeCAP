Over the past 24 hours, the weather in Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak during the latter part of the day, indicative of typical diurnal variation possibly exacerbated by local weather conditions. The humidity levels remained relatively high throughout the period, with a noticeable peak coinciding with the lowest temperatures in the early morning hours, which is common due to nighttime cooling leading to condensation. Air pressure showed a slight increasing trend towards the end of the period, which could signal the approach of a high-pressure system that might lead to settled weather conditions. Wind speed remained light and variable, with a slight increase observed towards the end of the 24-hour period, which could contribute to changes in the upcoming weather patterns. The prevailing wind direction was southerly to southeasterly, shifting to more variable directions including a northerly component, which may indicate the passage of a frontal system or local convective activity influencing the wind patterns.
