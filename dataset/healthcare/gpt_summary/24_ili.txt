Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a steady increase in the percentage of patients experiencing Influenza-like Illness (ILI), with the ratio of ILI patients consistently rising and surpassing the baseline, which suggests a heightened level of influenza activity. The age group 5-24 has shown the most significant increase in ILI cases, which could imply a greater spread in schools or amongst young adults, potentially leading to increased absenteeism from education and work. The oldest age group, 65 and over, while having fewer ILI cases in absolute numbers, still demonstrates a concerning upward trend that could put a strain on healthcare resources due to the higher risk of complications this demographic faces. The overall number of patients has also seen an uptick in the latter weeks, which may indicate a peak season for ILI and could lead to increased hospital visits and a need for more medical supplies and staff. Public health initiatives may need to focus on vaccination, awareness, and preventive measures to manage the growing incidence of ILI, especially in the most affected age groups.
