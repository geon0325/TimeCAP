Over the last 20 weeks, the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia to the total number of deaths has been fluctuating, with an overall increasing trend, starting at 8.41% and ending at 10.29%, which surpasses the average ratio of 7.84%. The total number of deaths peaked in the last recorded week at 63,602, alongside a notable rise in pneumonia-related deaths, which jumped from 5,094 to 6,534, the highest in the 20-week period. Influenza-related deaths remained relatively low and stable, with minor fluctuations and no clear trend. The lowest ratio of mortality from these illnesses was observed in week 15 at 5.91%, which is significantly below the average, indicating a potential period of relative decline in such cases. The recent sharp increase in the ratio, particularly driven by pneumonia, could indicate a seasonal surge or an emerging healthcare challenge, necessitating closer monitoring and potentially increased healthcare resources to manage the rise in cases.
