Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable increase in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the ratio of positive specimens nearly quadrupling from 1.05% to 3.91%. This upward trend is primarily driven by a significant rise in Influenza A positive specimens, which saw an increase in its ratio from 0.83% to 3.54%, indicating a growing prevalence of this strain. Meanwhile, Influenza B has shown a more stable pattern, with its ratio fluctuating moderately around the 0.3-0.5% range, suggesting a consistent but less dramatic presence. The peak in positive specimens occurred in the most recent week with 3.91% overall positivity, with the highest number of positive specimens recorded for both Influenza A and B at 1002 and 107 respectively. The escalation in positive influenza cases could signal an impending strain on healthcare resources and necessitates preparedness for increased hospital admissions and a potential rise in healthcare-associated costs.
