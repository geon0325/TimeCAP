Over the last 20 weeks, the analysis of respiratory specimens reveals a fluctuation in the percentage of positive tests for influenza, with a peak at 1.31% in week 8 and a notable decrease to 0.77% in the latest week, falling below the 20-week average of 1.01%. The ratio of positive specimens for Influenza A reached its highest at 0.88% in week 13, indicating a mid-season surge, but this has since declined to 0.49% in the final week. Conversely, Influenza B showed a higher initial positivity ratio, peaking at 0.78% in week 6, but experienced a more pronounced decrease to 0.28% by week 20. The overall decline in positivity rates for both Influenza A and B in recent weeks may suggest a tapering off of the influenza season, potentially easing the burden on healthcare resources. However, the healthcare system should remain vigilant for possible fluctuations and ensure adequate preparation for subsequent seasons, including vaccination and antiviral strategies.
