Over the past 20 weeks, the data indicates a fluctuating yet overall increasing trend in the mortality ratio of Influenza or Pneumonia to total deaths, starting at 5.44% and peaking at 6.28% in the 16th week before slightly decreasing to 6.01% in the last week. The total number of deaths has shown an upward trend, beginning at 51,191 and rising to 54,120. Deaths attributed to Influenza have increased significantly from 5 in the first week to 48 in the final week, demonstrating an upward trend in influenza-related mortality. Pneumonia-related deaths have also risen, with a minor fluctuation, from 2,781 to 3,202, suggesting a persistent burden of pneumonia on the healthcare system. This overall increase in the ratio of deaths from Influenza or Pneumonia could indicate a growing impact of these respiratory conditions on public health, necessitating focused healthcare strategies and resource allocation to manage and mitigate their effects.
