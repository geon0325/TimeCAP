Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, followed by a steady increase, suggesting a typical diurnal pattern with warmer conditions during the day giving way to cooler temperatures overnight. Humidity levels have shown significant variation, with notably higher values during the early morning hours, indicative of a more muggy start to the day. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable with only minor fluctuations, which points to a period of steady weather patterns without any immediate signs of significant weather systems moving in. Wind speeds were mostly light but picked up later in the day, with winds generally coming from the south, shifting to blow from the east, which may bring in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. The wind direction consistency from the east could also suggest a more stable weather pattern setting in for the short term.
