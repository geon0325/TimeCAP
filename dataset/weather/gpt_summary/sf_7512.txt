Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak during the late afternoon before cooling slightly towards the evening. Humidity levels started relatively high and saw a noticeable decrease as temperatures rose, indicating a typical diurnal pattern. Air pressure remained fairly stable throughout the period, with only minor fluctuations, suggesting a steady weather pattern without significant frontal activity. Wind speeds were generally light and decreased to very light breezes during the day, which, combined with higher temperatures, could have contributed to a sense of warmth and stagnation. The wind direction was predominantly from the west-southwest, which is common for San Francisco, given its coastal location and prevailing wind patterns.
