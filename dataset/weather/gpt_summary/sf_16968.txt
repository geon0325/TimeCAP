Humidity levels were notably high throughout the period, reaching saturation at multiple points, which could have led to foggy conditions, especially during the early morning when temperature and humidity conditions are ideal for fog formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable, suggesting a period of settled weather without significant frontal activity.
