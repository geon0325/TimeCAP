Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with a slight downward trend, dropping from 4155.86 to 4166.45, suggesting caution in the equity markets. The VIX, which measures market volatility, has fluctuated but ended the period higher at 20.70, indicating increased market uncertainty. The Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 indices have remained relatively stable, with the FTSE 100 showing a more noticeable decline on the last trading day, which could be a sign of changing sentiment in the European market. Gold Futures have seen a significant drop from 1876.70 to 1767.90, which may reflect a shift in investor preference for riskier assets or a strengthening dollar, as seen by the decrease in EUR/USD exchange rate from 1.22 to 1.19 and the appreciation of USD against JPY and CNY. Crude oil futures have trended upwards, moving from 63.58 to 71.64, suggesting a bullish outlook for energy commodities amidst potential supply concerns or expectations of increasing demand.
