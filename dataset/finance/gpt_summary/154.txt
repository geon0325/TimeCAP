Over the past 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a general uptrend, closing higher by approximately 1.8% from the starting point, signaling a positive sentiment among investors despite some fluctuations. Conversely, the VIX, a measure of market volatility, has trended downward, dropping from 17.52 to 15.20, which indicates a decrease in investor fear and market uncertainty. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 reflected a similar upward trend, with the Nikkei closing up by 4.6%, which may suggest a global market confidence. Gold futures, typically a safe-haven asset, dipped slightly by 0.8%, aligning with the reduced need for safety as perceived by the market. Meanwhile, crude oil futures have been moderately volatile but ended slightly higher, and currency exchange rates have shown the USD strengthening against the EUR and JPY but remaining relatively stable against the CNY, which could imply a stronger position for the US dollar in the currency markets.
