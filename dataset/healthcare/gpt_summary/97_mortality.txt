Over the last 20 weeks, mortality rates from influenza and pneumonia as a proportion of total deaths have fluctuated, with a notable peak of 8.33% in week 7, which is significantly higher than the 20-week average of 7.84%. Despite this peak, the overall trend suggests a gradual increase in the ratio from the initial 6.26% to a high of 7.75% in week 18, followed by a slight decrease in weeks 19 and 20. The absolute number of deaths from pneumonia consistently exceeded those from influenza, with the highest reported pneumonia-related deaths at 4418 in week 7, coinciding with the peak in the mortality ratio. The number of deaths due to influenza showed a sharp increase between weeks 5 and 7, followed by a more gradual rise, indicating a potential outbreak or seasonal surge. The data suggests that while overall mortality from these respiratory conditions remains a significant portion of total deaths, there are weekly fluctuations that could reflect changes in disease prevalence, healthcare practices, or reporting patterns, which require ongoing monitoring and resource allocation to manage potential healthcare system impacts.
