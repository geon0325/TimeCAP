Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have exhibited a slight fluctuation with a general trend of cooling during the early hours and then a gradual increase towards the latter part of the day. Humidity levels have remained high throughout the period, with a peak that suggests the presence of considerable moisture in the air, which could have led to foggy conditions, especially when combined with the relatively high and stable air pressure. The air pressure has been notably stable with only minor variations, indicating steady weather patterns without the presence of significant frontal systems. Wind speeds have been low to calm, suggesting a lack of strong weather systems in the vicinity, and could lead to the accumulation of pollutants and slower dispersion of fog or mist. Wind direction has predominantly been from the southeast to the northeast, which is typical for the region and suggests the influence of local sea breezes on the weather conditions.
