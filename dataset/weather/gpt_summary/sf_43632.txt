Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperature exhibited significant diurnal variation, with a noticeable drop during the night followed by a rise through the day, indicating typical coastal city temperature dynamics. Humidity levels fluctuated markedly, reaching very high levels during the early morning hours when temperatures were at their lowest, which could have led to foggy conditions, a common occurrence in this region. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period with only slight variations, suggesting a period of steady weather without the immediate arrival of any new weather systems. Wind speeds varied modestly, with calmer conditions around dawn and brisker winds during the day, which is characteristic of the coastal breeze effect in this area. The wind direction shifted throughout the day, which is typical given the city's exposure to varying maritime influences.
