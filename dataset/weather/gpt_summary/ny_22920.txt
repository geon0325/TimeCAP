Over the past 24 hours in New York City, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature with a warming trend observed during the daytime, followed by a cooling period in the early hours. Humidity levels increased significantly overnight, which is typical when temperatures drop, and then decreased as temperatures rose again, indicating a cycle of diurnal variation. Air pressure remained relatively stable, indicating a period of steady weather without significant fronts or storms passing through the area. Wind speeds were consistently light, which would not contribute much to heat dispersion or the advection of weather systems. The wind direction varied but maintained a general westerly to southwesterly flow, suggesting a pattern that could be associated with the approach of a mild air mass to the region.
