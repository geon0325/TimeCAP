Over the past 24 hours in New York City, temperatures have followed an upward trend, peaking during the late afternoon before gradually declining towards the evening. Relative humidity levels saw a significant decrease through the afternoon hours, correlating with the peak in temperatures, suggesting an inverse relationship between temperature and humidity during this period.
