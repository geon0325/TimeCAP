Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a general upward trend, closing higher than the starting point despite some fluctuations, suggesting a cautiously optimistic sentiment among investors. The VIX, often referred to as the "fear index," has seen a slight decrease, indicating reduced market volatility and potentially increasing investor confidence. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 have also experienced overall gains, with the Nikkei showing a notable upward movement, which might reflect positive reactions to both domestic and global economic indicators. Gold futures have been relatively stable with a slight upward trend, hinting at sustained demand for safe-haven assets amidst ongoing uncertainties. Currency markets have seen the USD strengthening against the EUR and JPY but weakening against the CNY, which could have diverse effects on trade balances and could signal varying economic outlooks across these regions.
