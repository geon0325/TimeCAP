Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a slight downward trend in the ratio of mortality due to Influenza or Pneumonia in relation to total deaths, with a recent uptick in the last two weeks. The average mortality ratio of 7.84% is higher than that observed in most of the provided data points, suggesting a possible decrease in the impact of these respiratory conditions on overall mortality. However, the last two weeks have shown an increase from 6.18% to 6.54%, indicating a potential resurgence that warrants close monitoring. The number of deaths from pneumonia significantly outweighs those from influenza, suggesting that pneumonia is a more pressing concern in terms of morbidity. Fluctuations in the mortality ratio and the recent increase may necessitate adjustments in healthcare resource allocation and public health interventions to manage the burden of these respiratory illnesses effectively.
