Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable increase in the mortality ratio of influenza or pneumonia when compared to total deaths, rising from 5.14% to 7.61%, surpassing the average ratio of 7.84% in the final two weeks. While the total number of deaths fluctuated, there was a sharp increase in deaths attributed to influenza in the last four weeks, with the count jumping from 141 to 472. Pneumonia deaths also increased steadily over the period, culminating in a peak of 4,137 in the final week. This upward trend in both influenza and pneumonia-related mortality could indicate the onset of a more severe season for these illnesses, potentially straining healthcare resources. The recent escalation in the mortality ratio suggests a heightened need for preventive measures, such as vaccination and public health interventions, to mitigate the impact on the healthcare system.
