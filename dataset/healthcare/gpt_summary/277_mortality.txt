Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia relative to total deaths has fluctuated between 5.81% and 6.58%, consistently remaining below the average of 7.84%. Despite the total number of deaths peaking at 59,727 in week 13, the corresponding number of deaths from Influenza and Pneumonia did not follow the same peak, suggesting that other factors may have contributed to the increased mortality during that period. There has been a notable decline in deaths attributed to Influenza from week 9 onwards, reaching a low of 12 deaths by week 18, possibly indicating a reduction in Influenza incidence or effective management strategies. However, deaths from Pneumonia have shown less variability, with a slight increase in the most recent weeks, warranting ongoing surveillance and potential healthcare resource allocation. The data suggest that while the total mortality rate has varied, the impact of Influenza and Pneumonia on overall mortality has decreased, albeit still requiring attention from healthcare systems to monitor trends and prepare for potential surges.
