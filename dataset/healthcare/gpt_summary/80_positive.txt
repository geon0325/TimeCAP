Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a fluctuating but overall decreasing trend in the percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza, with a peak positivity rate of 9.70% in week 1, declining to 1.94% by week 20. Influenza B has been the predominant strain throughout the period, initially accounting for 7.13% of specimens but dropping to 0.66% in the final week, while Influenza A exhibited a less pronounced decrease from 2.57% to 1.28%. The total number of specimens tested decreased over time, with a notable reduction from 22,091 in week 1 to 9,404 in week 20, which could affect the perceived decline in positive cases due to reduced testing. The lowest positivity rates for both strains were observed in week 18, with Influenza A and B accounting for only 0.82% and 0.53% of specimens respectively. Healthcare systems may interpret this overall decline as indicative of a waning influenza season, but should remain vigilant for potential resurgences and maintain sufficient resources for testing and treatment.
