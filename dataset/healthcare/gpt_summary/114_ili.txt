Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a decreasing trend in the number of patients presenting with Influenza-like Illness (ILI), which is reflected across all age groups. The percentage of ILI patients has seen a significant drop from being above baseline to falling below the threshold, suggesting a noteworthy decline in ILI activity. The most significant decrease has been observed in the younger demographics, particularly in the 5-24 age group, which could imply a reduced transmission in settings such as schools and colleges. Despite the overall decline, there is a persistent presence of ILI cases in the elderly population, indicating a sustained vulnerability in this age group that warrants continued monitoring and targeted healthcare measures. The reduction in ILI cases eases the burden on healthcare resources, but the system must remain vigilant for potential upticks and ensure adequate preparedness for future ILI outbreaks.
