Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual decline in temperature from its peak during the day to a cooler state by early morning, followed by a steady rise as the new day progressed. Humidity levels varied significantly, starting at moderately high levels before rising to saturation around dawn and then dropping sharply as temperatures rose again. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, indicating no significant weather fronts passing through the area. Wind speeds were calm throughout the period, with a slight increase later in the day, and wind direction shifted from easterly to southerly before predominantly settling in a northerly orientation and then gradually veering to the east. These conditions suggest a typical pattern of diurnal variation without the presence of any immediate or severe weather events.
