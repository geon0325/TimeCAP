Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable decline in the number of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases across all age groups, with the highest number of cases reported at the start of the time frame and the lowest at the end. The proportion of ILI patients to total patients has decreased over time, starting well above the baseline for determining the influenza situation and ending below this threshold. The age group of 0-4 years consistently reported the highest number of ILI cases compared to other age groups, which may indicate a higher susceptibility or exposure risk in this demographic. The data suggests a downward trend in ILI activity, which could lead to a decrease in healthcare system strain, considering fewer ILI cases potentially require medical attention. However, continuous monitoring is essential, as the decrease has recently approached the baseline, which might indicate a need for preparedness should there be a resurgence in ILI cases.
