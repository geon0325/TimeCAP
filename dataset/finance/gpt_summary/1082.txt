Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a slight uptrend, closing higher at 4158.77 from an initial 4129.79, despite some volatility within the period. The VIX, which measures market volatility, has generally fluctuated without a clear trend, ending slightly lower at 16.87, indicating that while daily swings occurred, overall market fear has not significantly changed. The Nikkei 225 index has demonstrated a clear upward trend, moving from 28657.57 to 30093.59, which may reflect improving investor sentiment or economic conditions in Japan. Gold futures have seen a mild downtrend, moving from 2007.60 to 1980.70, which could suggest a decrease in safe-haven demand. Lastly, the USD has strengthened against both the EUR and JPY, with the exchange rates moving from 1.10 to 1.09 for the EUR/USD and from 134.70 to 136.43 for the USD/JPY, indicating potential shifts in currency markets that could affect international trade and investment flows.
