Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable decline in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the ratio of positive specimens decreasing from a peak of 24.73% to 3.06%. This trend is reflected in both Influenza A and B types, with Influenza A showing a decrease in the ratio of positive specimens from 20.21% to 1.37%, and Influenza B from 6.23% to 1.69% in the same time frame. Despite the overall reduction in positive rates, Influenza B's contribution to the positivity rate has increased relative to Influenza A, suggesting a shift in the predominant strain as the season progresses. The initial high positivity rates could have put significant strain on healthcare resources, but the current lower rates may indicate a reprieve for the system. It is important to continue monitoring these trends for any signs of resurgence and to adjust healthcare planning and resource allocation accordingly.
