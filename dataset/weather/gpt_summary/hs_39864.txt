Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have shown a gradual increase, peaking during the late afternoon hours, suggestive of typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels started relatively high and showed some fluctuation but remained elevated, indicating a muggy atmosphere that persisted throughout the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight decrease noted towards the end of the period, which could signal an approaching weather system. Wind speeds varied modestly and were generally light to moderate, with some increase observed in the late hours, which could contribute to a slight cooling effect at night.
