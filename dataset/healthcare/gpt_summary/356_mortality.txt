Over the last 20 weeks, the data reveal a notable fluctuation in mortality due to Influenza or Pneumonia, with a peak ratio of 9.15% in week 9, significantly above the average ratio of 7.84%. Despite this peak, there has been a general downward trend in the ratio of mortality from these causes, decreasing from 8.97% in week 6 to 6.59% in week 20. The total number of deaths peaked in week 9 at 70,168, correlating with the highest mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia, suggesting a potential strain on healthcare resources during that period. The number of deaths specifically from Influenza followed a rising trend until week 7, reaching 1,048 deaths, before gradually declining to 307 by week 20. This data indicates a seasonal pattern in respiratory-related mortality, which appears to be on a decline towards the end of the 20-week period, but with instances of heightened impact on mortality rates, warranting continued public health vigilance and resource allocation.
