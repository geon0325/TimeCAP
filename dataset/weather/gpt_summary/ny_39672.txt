Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual decline in temperature, followed by a slight recovery, suggesting a typical diurnal temperature variation with cooler conditions overnight. Humidity levels have shown significant fluctuations, peaking at certain hours, which may have contributed to variable sensations of temperature comfort throughout the day. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable, indicating a period without major weather disturbances or the introduction of new weather systems. Wind speeds varied, including a period of increased intensity, which could have influenced wind chill factors, making it feel cooler than the actual temperature, especially during the hours of higher wind velocity. The wind direction has been predominantly from the south and west, shifting occasionally, which could have implications for air quality and temperature distribution across the city.
