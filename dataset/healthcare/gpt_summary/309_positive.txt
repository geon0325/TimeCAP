Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable increase in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the ratio of positive specimens rising from 0.05% to a peak of 6.23% in week 15, before declining to 2.12% in the most recent week. Influenza A has been the predominant strain throughout this period, reaching a high positivity ratio of 6.17% also in week 15, while Influenza B has remained relatively stable with its ratio never exceeding 0.08%. The total number of specimens tested has been on an upward trend, more than tripling from 36,912 in week 1 to 150,872 in week 18, indicating an increased testing capacity or possibly a higher demand due to rising infection rates. There was a sharp increase in the number of specimens testing positive for Influenza A between weeks 9 and 15, suggesting a significant wave of infections that could have stressed healthcare resources, followed by a decline that could indicate the passing of a peak in Influenza A activity. The consistent but low presence of Influenza B, in comparison, suggests that it has not been a major contributor to the overall increase in positive influenza specimens during this period.
