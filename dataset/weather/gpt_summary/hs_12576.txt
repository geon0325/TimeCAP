Over the last 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching a peak in the late afternoon before stabilizing. Relative humidity levels showed a decreasing trend through the day, which is typical as temperatures rise, with the lowest humidity coinciding with the highest temperatures. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the period, indicating a possible change in weather patterns or the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds remained relatively light with some variability, and there was a notable shift in wind direction from northerly to easterly as the day progressed. These conditions suggest a stable weather pattern, but the declining air pressure could signal an approaching front or weather system that may affect local conditions soon.
