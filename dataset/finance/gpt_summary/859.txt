Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with a general downward trend, closing 7.51% lower than the period's high, which could indicate a bearish sentiment among investors. The VIX, which measures market volatility, has risen, peaking at 34.02 before settling at 28.36, suggesting increased market uncertainty and potential risk aversion. Both the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 have experienced declines, with the Nikkei posting a modest recovery towards the period's end, while Gold Futures have seen relatively less volatility but a slight downward trend, indicating it may be losing some of its safe-haven appeal. Crude Oil Futures have seen fluctuations with an overall increase in prices, possibly due to geopolitical tensions or supply concerns, which may lead to higher inflationary pressures. Lastly, the currency markets have shown the USD strengthening against the EUR and JPY but holding steady against the CNY, which could impact international trade dynamics and cross-border investment flows.
