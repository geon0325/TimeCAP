Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, with a peak of 10.89% in week 11, which is significantly higher than the average ratio of 7.84%. This peak coincides with a sharp increase in the number of deaths attributed to influenza, which jumped from double to triple digits in week 9 and reached its highest at 1626 in week 11. Although the total number of deaths showed a general upward trend peaking in week 9 at 67,495, this was followed by a gradual decrease over the subsequent weeks. Pneumonia deaths remained consistently high, contributing to the increased mortality ratio during the peak weeks. The data suggests a potential strain on healthcare resources during these peaks and underscores the importance of continued monitoring and response strategies for respiratory illnesses.
