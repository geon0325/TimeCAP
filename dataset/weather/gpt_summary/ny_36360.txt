Over the last 24 hours, New York City experienced relatively stable temperatures with a gradual increase during the day before cooling slightly at night, staying within a typical range for the season. Humidity levels fluctuated modestly, with higher values during the early hours that tapered off as the day progressed, indicating the presence of moisture in the air that could have contributed to a feeling of dampness or potential for fog formation in the morning or evening. Atmospheric pressure remained largely constant with a slight increase mid-period, suggesting stable weather conditions without the immediate likelihood of significant weather disturbances. Wind speeds were generally light and variable, with a modest increase in the latter part of the period, which would not have a significant impact on day-to-day activities but could contribute to a slight wind chill effect. The wind direction was predominantly from the north and northwest, shifting occasionally, which is consistent with the passage of a weak front or typical variability in the local wind patterns.
