Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual rise in temperature reaching its peak during the late afternoon before slightly declining towards the evening, which is typical for the diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels showed an inverse relationship with temperature, where it was highest during the cooler early morning hours and decreased as temperatures rose, indicating a common pattern of atmospheric moisture content in relation to daytime heating. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight decrease in the latest hours, which could suggest a minor weather system approaching or passing through the area. Wind speeds varied moderately with some increase in the evening, potentially contributing to a perceived drop in temperature due to wind chill. Wind direction was predominantly from the southeast, shifting to the north-northwest for a brief period before reverting, which is indicative of shifting weather patterns that could influence local weather conditions such as storm development or the clearing of cloud cover.
