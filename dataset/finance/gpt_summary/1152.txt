Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 exhibited a mild downward trend, starting at 4576.73 and decreasing to 4433.31, reflecting a cautious sentiment among investors. The VIX, or Volatility Index, fluctuated but ended slightly higher, moving from 13.93 to 15.08, which indicates an increase in market volatility and investor uncertainty. International markets also showed signs of instability; the Nikkei 225 experienced volatility with a general decline, while the FTSE 100 was relatively flat but ended the period slightly lower, suggesting that concerns are not confined to the U.S. market. Commodity prices were mixed, with Gold Futures showing slight resilience, ending marginally higher at 1917.90 from 1940.70, while Crude Oil Futures fell from 81.37 to 80.10, reflecting potential concerns over global demand. The foreign exchange market saw the Euro and Japanese Yen slightly depreciating against the USD, whereas the Chinese Yuan remained largely unchanged against the Dollar, which could impact international trade dynamics and investment flows.
