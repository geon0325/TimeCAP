Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable increase in the proportion of deaths due to Influenza or Pneumonia relative to total deaths, rising from 5.76% to a peak of 10.89%, before slightly decreasing to 10.23% in the final week. This trend indicates a significant upswing, particularly in the later weeks, with the ratio exceeding the 20-week average of 7.84% in the last six weeks of the time series. The absolute number of deaths attributed to Influenza saw an extraordinary spike in week 16, with 1165 deaths compared to a range of 7-157 in previous weeks, before settling at a higher level between 1360 and 1626 in the subsequent weeks. Pneumonia-related deaths have also increased but with a more gradual trend, moving from 2935 to 4877 deaths over the period. These trends could signal a growing burden on healthcare resources and may necessitate enhanced public health measures and healthcare planning to manage the increased incidence of these respiratory diseases.
