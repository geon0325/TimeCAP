Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a generally upward trend, increasing from 3066.91 to 3140.98, indicating a positive sentiment in the U.S. equity market. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, has remained relatively low with minor fluctuations, suggesting a stable market environment during this period. In Asia, the Nikkei 225 also experienced an overall increase, reinforcing the global equity market strength, despite some volatility in the middle of the observed period. Gold Futures have seen a slight decline from 1508.00 to 1465.60, which may reflect a reduced demand for safe-haven assets as investors favor equities. Meanwhile, Crude Oil Futures have been more volatile with an overall slight decline, and the major currency pairs, EUR/USD and USD/JPY, have been relatively stable, with the USD/CNY pair showing a modest depreciation of the yuan against the dollar.
