Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have experienced a gradual decrease overnight before stabilizing during the day, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels have been exceptionally high, reaching saturation at several points, which suggests the potential for fog development or precipitation. Air pressure has shown a steady increase through most of the period, implying a strengthening high-pressure system that could lead to more stable weather conditions. Wind speeds have been generally light but picked up slightly during the latter part of the period, with a shift in wind direction from northerly to easterly, which could influence temperature and moisture transport. The combination of high humidity, light winds, and varying temperatures suggests there may have been conditions conducive to morning fog and possibly overcast skies, with a trend towards clearer and more stable conditions as pressure increased.
