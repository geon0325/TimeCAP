Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a typical diurnal temperature cycle with a notable increase in temperature during the daytime followed by a cooling trend in the evening and through the night. Relative humidity remained high throughout the period, but there was a significant drop during the late afternoon hours, which coincided with the peak in temperature, indicating a possible localized dry air mass intrusion. Air pressure was relatively stable with only minor fluctuations, suggesting a steady atmospheric condition without the immediate influence of strong weather systems. Wind speed was consistently light, which would have limited dispersion of any local pollutants and may have contributed to a sense of mugginess given the high humidity. The wind direction showed variability, predominantly from the south and southwest, but with a notable shift to a more westerly direction in the later hours, which is typical for coastal cities like San Francisco and could indicate a developing onshore flow.
