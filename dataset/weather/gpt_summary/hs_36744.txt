Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has demonstrated a rising trend, peaking during the late afternoon before gradually declining towards the evening. Humidity levels fluctuated, with notable increases corresponding to the cooler early morning and late evening hours, which could have led to periods of higher perceived mugginess. Air pressure experienced a gentle decline throughout the period, suggesting a possible shift in weather patterns or the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate but increased significantly during the afternoon, potentially affecting outdoor activities and conditions at sea. The predominant wind direction was from the east to southeast, shifting more southerly during the day, and then varying more widely in the later hours, which could be indicative of a changing weather system moving through the area.
