Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced relatively stable temperatures that trended slightly warmer during the daytime, followed by modest cooling in the evening. Humidity levels remained high throughout the period, suggesting a muggy and potentially uncomfortable atmosphere for residents. Atmospheric pressure showed a slight decreasing trend, which could indicate the approach of a weather system that may lead to changes in weather patterns such as precipitation or storms. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate but increased during the latter part of the period, with some variability in wind direction, primarily blowing from the south to southeast, which is typical for Houston's weather. The combination of high humidity, increasing wind speeds, and decreasing pressure might lead to developing weather events that should be monitored closely for any potential impact on the local area.
