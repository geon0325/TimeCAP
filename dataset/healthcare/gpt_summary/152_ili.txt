Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant fluctuation in the number of influenza-like illness (ILI) cases across different age groups, with the ratio of ILI patients peaking above the baseline level and then gradually declining to below the baseline. Initially, the ILI ratio increased, surpassing the baseline threshold and suggesting a spike in ILI activity which may have led to increased healthcare utilization and a potential strain on healthcare resources. The highest ILI ratios were observed in the middle of the observed period, indicating a period of heightened alert for public health authorities. Following this peak, there has been a steady downward trend in ILI ratios across all age groups, with the most recent data showing a ratio well below the baseline, signaling a decrease in the prevalence of ILI. The age group of 5-24 years consistently showed higher ILI patient numbers, which could be indicative of greater transmission within this demographic, potentially affecting school attendance and productivity.
