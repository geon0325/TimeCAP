The time-series data analysis of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) over the last 20 weeks indicates a consistent decline in the number of ILI patients across all age groups, with the ratio of ILI patients remaining well below the baseline of 2.9%. The most significant decrease in ILI cases is observed in the age group of 5-24, which could suggest a strong seasonality effect or successful public health interventions targeting this demographic. Despite slight fluctuations, there has been a gradual decrease in ILI incidence among patients aged 0-4 and 25-49, with older age groups (50-64 and 65 or more) showing the least variability in case numbers. The overall ratio of ILI patients has shown a downward trend, indicating a period of low ILI activity relative to the established baseline, which could imply reduced strain on healthcare resources specific to influenza management. However, continued surveillance is necessary to monitor for potential outbreaks and to ensure the healthcare system remains prepared for any increases in ILI cases that could challenge the current status quo.
