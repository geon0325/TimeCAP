Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have experienced a gradual decline before slightly rebounding, indicative of a typical diurnal pattern with a cooler night transitioning to a warmer daytime period. Humidity levels showed significant variance, increasing sharply during the nighttime hours and then dropping markedly during the day, which may have been associated with the passage of a frontal system or diurnal heating effects. Atmospheric pressure experienced some fluctuations, with a noteworthy drop at one point, potentially signaling the movement of a weather front through the area, which could have been responsible for changes in wind speed and direction. Wind conditions were relatively steady at first but became more variable later on, including shifts in direction that suggest the influence of changing weather systems. The combination of these factors – temperature shifts, humidity changes, pressure variations, and wind adjustments – points to an active weather pattern for Houston that could have implications for cloud development, precipitation chances, and overall weather stability in the near term.
