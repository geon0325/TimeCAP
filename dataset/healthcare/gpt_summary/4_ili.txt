Over the past 20 weeks, the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data indicates a declining trend in the number of ILI cases across all age groups, with the most significant reductions observed in the youngest demographic (ages 0-4). Initially, the ILI ratio exceeded the baseline threshold but has since decreased consistently, falling below the baseline in recent weeks. This downward trend suggests a lessening burden on the healthcare system from ILI, potentially freeing up resources for other medical concerns. However, continued surveillance remains critical to monitor for any changes that may indicate a resurgence. The overall reduction in ILI cases could also reflect the effectiveness of public health interventions and the possible influence of seasonal factors on disease transmission.
