Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching a peak in the late afternoon before slightly declining towards the evening. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuation, with notably high humidity during the early morning hours, indicative of possible morning fog or dew, and lower humidity as temperatures peaked. Air pressure has been on a slow decline throughout the period, which can be associated with the development of unsettled weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally light with occasional calm periods, but there was an increase in wind activity towards the end of the 24-hour period. The variability in wind direction suggests the presence of shifting weather patterns that could influence local weather conditions in the short term.
