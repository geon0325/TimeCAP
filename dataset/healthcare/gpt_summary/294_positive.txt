Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a fluctuating but generally low prevalence of influenza in respiratory specimens, with an overall average positivity rate of 6.26%. The number of specimens tested has increased steadily, suggesting heightened surveillance or increased incidence of respiratory illness, peaking at 49,688 tests in the final week. The ratio of positive specimens for influenza has seen a slight upward trend in recent weeks, reaching a high of 0.16% in the last week, which could signal a potential onset of an influenza wave. Influenza A positivity ratios have remained relatively stable, showing a minor increase towards the end, whereas Influenza B has shown more variation, with its positivity ratio also increasing towards the end of the 20-week period. The healthcare system may need to prepare for a potential increase in influenza cases, considering the recent upward trend in positive specimen ratios for both Influenza A and B.
