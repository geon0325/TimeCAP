Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature, generally maintaining a mild and stable range. Humidity levels started moderately high and saw a decrease towards the evening before slightly increasing again at night, which could have contributed to a feeling of varying comfort levels throughout the day and night. Air pressure has been on a gradual increase, indicating a potential period of fair and stable weather conditions ahead. Wind speeds were moderate at the beginning of the period but became very calm during the middle of the day, possibly leading to a decrease in air quality in urban areas. The wind direction varied significantly, starting from a southerly direction, becoming variable with almost no wind, and then shifting to a northerly direction by the end of the period, which could signal a change in weather patterns or the approach of a frontal system.
