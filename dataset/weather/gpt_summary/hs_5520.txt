Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature exhibited a diurnal pattern with a peak during the late afternoon hours, followed by a gradual decrease throughout the night and into the early morning. Humidity levels were variable, reaching saturation during the night which may have prompted foggy conditions or dew, but decreased significantly during the day, indicating drier conditions. Air pressure showed a slight downward trend over the period, suggesting the possibility of a developing low-pressure system which could lead to unsettled weather. Wind speeds varied, with some gustier conditions observed, particularly in the late afternoon and early evening, which may have contributed to a more dynamic weather situation. The wind direction was predominantly from the south to southeast, which typically brings warmer and more humid air from the Gulf of Mexico to the Houston area.
