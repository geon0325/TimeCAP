Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, reaching its lowest point late at night and early morning before rising again during the day. The humidity levels showed a marked increase overnight, maxing out at 100%, which is indicative of possible fog or mist formation during those hours, followed by a decrease as temperatures rose. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with a slight uptrend, suggesting stable weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally light and variable, with a slight increase during the day, which could contribute to the dispersal of any overnight fog or mist. The wind direction was predominantly from the north and shifted slightly to the northeast, consistent with the passage of a front or localized pressure systems.
