Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a noticeable trend of increasing temperatures, reaching a peak in the latter part of the period, suggesting a warming trend that could lead to warmer than average conditions in the short term. Humidity levels showed significant variation, starting at moderate levels, increasing to a high in the middle of the period, and then dramatically dropping towards the end, indicating a shift from potentially damp conditions to much drier air. Air pressure has been gradually decreasing, which could be indicative of a developing low-pressure system that may affect weather patterns, potentially leading to increased cloudiness or precipitation. Wind speeds have generally been low to moderate, with a significant period of calm conditions, which could result in stagnant air and potentially contribute to the build-up of pollutants or fog. Lastly, wind direction varied widely throughout the period, but with the calm wind conditions, no strong wind-related weather patterns are expected to dominate.
