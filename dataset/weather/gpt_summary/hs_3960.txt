Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature, experiencing a gradual decline before a significant rise during the day and then gently tapering off towards the evening. Humidity levels started moderately but increased sharply, reaching saturation at one point, before declining again towards the latter part of the day, which is typical of diurnal patterns affected by temperature changes. Air pressure showed a slight overall decrease through the period, indicating a possible weakening of the high-pressure system that might lead to less stable weather conditions. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate with a peak in the later hours, suggesting an increase in wind activity which could contribute to changes in weather patterns. The wind direction varied throughout the day, with a period of calm winds in the early hours, followed by shifts primarily from southerly to northerly directions, suggesting a frontal passage or local shifts in weather systems.
