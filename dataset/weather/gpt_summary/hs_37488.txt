Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures exhibited a typical diurnal pattern with a peak during the afternoon and a gradual cooling towards the early morning hours. Relative humidity levels were high throughout the period, reaching saturation at times, which could have contributed to the formation of fog or mist, especially during the early morning or late evening when temperatures were at their lowest. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with only slight fluctuations, indicating a period of steady weather without the immediate influence of strong weather systems. Wind speeds increased as the day progressed, becoming quite brisk in the later hours, which may have helped to disperse any humidity-induced ground-level moisture. Wind direction was predominantly from the south to the south-east, which is typical for Houston and suggests a continuation of warm, moist air being drawn in from the Gulf of Mexico.
