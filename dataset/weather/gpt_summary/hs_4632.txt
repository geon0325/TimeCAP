Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has experienced a notable diurnal range, beginning and ending on the cooler side with a significant increase during the day, indicative of clear skies or minimal cloud cover which would allow for rapid warming. Relative humidity levels have shown an inverse relationship with temperature, starting higher during the cooler early hours, decreasing as temperatures rose, and then increasing slightly as the night approached, suggesting a typical pattern where the air can hold less moisture as it cools. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight fluctuation in the middle of the time period, which could be associated with a transient weather system passing through the area. Wind speeds were predominantly light and variable, with a couple of increases that could have been associated with localized weather fronts or changes in the larger-scale atmospheric flow. Finally, wind direction was generally variable with no dominant trend, indicating the absence of a strong weather system influencing the local wind patterns during this period.
