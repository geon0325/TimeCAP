Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before stabilizing at a high level through the evening. Relative humidity showed significant fluctuations, with a notable decrease in the late evening, suggesting dryer conditions moving into the night. Atmospheric pressure saw minor variations but took a sharp dip towards the latter part of the period, which could indicate the approach of a weather system or front. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate throughout the day, with a couple of instances of higher gusts; wind direction varied, with a general trend toward westerly and northwesterly winds, which is typical for the region. The combination of high temperatures and low humidity later in the day could increase the risk of fire danger, while the dip in pressure might suggest the potential for changing weather patterns or increased wind activity in the near future.
