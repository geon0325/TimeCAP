Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there's been a noticeable diurnal temperature variation, with values peaking in the late afternoon and reaching their lowest point in the early morning hours, as is typical due to the absence of sunlight at night. Humidity levels fluctuated inversely with temperature, increasing overnight as temperatures dropped and decreasing during the day, which can affect comfort levels and may have implications for local weather patterns such as fog formation in the early hours. Air pressure remained relatively stable, showing a slight decreasing trend towards the end of the period, which could potentially signal a change in weather conditions if the trend continues. Wind speeds were generally low throughout the day, with occasional calm conditions, indicating a period of relatively settled weather. The wind direction varied but showed no consistent pattern, suggesting the absence of a dominant weather front influencing the local climate during the observed period.
