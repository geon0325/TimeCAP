Over the past 24 hours in New York City, there has been a gradual increase in temperature, suggesting a warming trend that peaked during the late afternoon hours before starting to decline. Humidity levels experienced fluctuations, with higher percentages occurring during the cooler early morning and latter part of the day, indicative of the potential for a muggy or damp feeling in the air. Air pressure showed a slight but consistent downward trend, which could be associated with a change in weather patterns, possibly leading to increased cloudiness or chances of precipitation. Wind speeds remained relatively light with some variability, but there was no significant wind event noted. The wind direction was variable throughout the period, with several instances of calm conditions (indicated by zero degrees), which may contribute to a sense of stagnation in the air and could affect air quality.
