Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable decline in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a peak ratio of 26.27% in week 2 dropping to 1.01% by week 20. Influenza A has been the predominant strain throughout the period, although its incidence has significantly decreased from a high of 26.15% to a low of 0.46%. Influenza B has remained a relatively minor contributor to overall positive specimens, but it has shown a slight increase in the later weeks, rising from 0.09% to 0.56%. The observed decline in positive influenza rates could suggest a waning of the flu season or the effectiveness of preventive measures, which could alleviate some pressure on healthcare resources. However, the healthcare system should remain vigilant for possible fluctuations in influenza activity and maintain readiness for increased testing and vaccination efforts, especially given the slight uptick in Influenza B ratios in recent weeks.
