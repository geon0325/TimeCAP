Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak during the late afternoon before stabilizing slightly below the day's maximum. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuation, with a period of complete saturation during the early morning hours, indicating the possibility of fog or dew, and later decreasing substantially as temperatures rose. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with a slight increase towards the middle of the day, suggesting stable weather conditions. Wind speeds varied modestly, with a gentle increase towards the evening, while wind direction shifted from predominantly southeasterly in the early hours to southerly and occasionally westerly later in the day, which could influence local weather patterns, possibly ushering in a change in weather conditions. The combination of high temperatures and varying humidity levels could have led to discomfort for residents, while the stable pressure and changing winds would be of interest to those concerned with aviation or outdoor activities.
