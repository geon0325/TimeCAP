Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has displayed a typical diurnal pattern, peaking during the afternoon hours and reaching its lowest point towards the early morning. Humidity levels have been relatively high, increasing as temperatures dropped, which is indicative of the area's moist climate and could suggest a discomforting level of mugginess or potential for morning fog formation. Air pressure has remained fairly stable, showing only slight fluctuations which are normal and do not indicate any significant weather events. Wind speeds have been moderate to light, with some variability but without any strong gusts that would be cause for concern. Wind direction has been variable, with a general tendency towards easterly directions, shifting occasionally to include northerly and southerly components, which may affect local temperature and humidity levels depending on the origin of the air masses.
