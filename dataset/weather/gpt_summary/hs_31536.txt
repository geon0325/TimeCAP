Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature from the daytime high to a nighttime low, followed by a slight warming trend toward the current hour. Humidity levels have shown some fluctuations but have generally remained high, which is typical for the region and could contribute to a muggy feeling in the air. Air pressure has been slowly decreasing, indicating a potential change in weather patterns, such as the approach of a weather system that could lead to increased cloudiness or precipitation. Wind speeds have been mostly gentle to moderate, with some increase in the evening hours, and the wind has been predominantly blowing from the south to southeast, which could bring in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. The combined effect of these indicators suggests a stable but potentially moist weather pattern, with the possibility of developing weather activity due to the decreasing air pressure.
