Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a gradual increase in the proportion of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases across all age groups, with the percentage of ILI patients rising from 1.57% to 2.68%. This trend is nearing the 2.9% threshold that is used to gauge the severity of influenza outbreaks. The most significant rise has been observed in the youngest (0-4 years) and school-aged (5-24 years) cohorts, which could indicate a higher transmission rate among children and young adults. Although the overall ILI ratio has not yet surpassed the benchmark, the continuous upward trajectory suggests that healthcare facilities should prepare for a potential surge in cases. The increasing ILI case counts across all age groups, especially during the last five weeks of the data where the percentage of ILI patients consistently exceeded 2%, could lead to increased healthcare utilization and the need for enhanced surveillance and preventive measures.
