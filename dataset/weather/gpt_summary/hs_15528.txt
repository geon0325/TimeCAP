Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, peaking during the late afternoon before starting to decrease slightly as night approached. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuation, with a notable increase during the early morning hours, indicating the potential for fog or dew, and then a substantial decrease as the temperature reached its peak, suggesting drier conditions during the afternoon. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight variation that is typical of normal diurnal patterns and is not indicative of any immediate, significant weather changes. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate and displayed a slight increase towards the evening, while wind direction varied but predominantly came from a southerly direction, which is common for Houston and can contribute to the warmer temperatures observed. The combination of high temperatures and varying humidity levels could lead to discomfort for individuals outdoors, while the stable pressure and moderate winds do not suggest any drastic weather events on the horizon.
