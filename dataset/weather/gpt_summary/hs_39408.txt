Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have shown a typical diurnal pattern with a peak during the late afternoon hours and a gradual decrease overnight into the early morning. Humidity levels have varied, reaching their highest point in the early morning, which likely corresponds to the lowest temperatures, and then decreasing as temperatures rose, indicating the common inverse relationship between temperature and relative humidity. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable, with only minor fluctuations, suggesting a stable weather pattern without the presence of significant weather fronts or systems. Wind speeds have been moderate, with some periods of increased velocity, and the wind direction has predominantly been from the south to southeast, which is typical for Houston and could contribute to the transport of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, influencing both humidity and temperature. The combination of these factors indicates consistent weather conditions without any extreme or rapid changes, conducive to outdoor activities and typical for this region during this time of the year.
