Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable increase in the proportion of deaths attributed to influenza or pneumonia, rising from 5.85% to 7.69%, surpassing the average ratio of 7.84% in the latter weeks. The total number of deaths fluctuated, with a peak at week 11 (61,090), while the number of deaths specifically from influenza and pneumonia followed an upward trend, with influenza-related deaths notably jumping from 18 in week 1 to 474 in week 20, and pneumonia-related deaths increasing from 3,001 to 3,987 in the same timeframe. The highest ratio of influenza or pneumonia deaths to total deaths occurred in week 12 (8.33%), coinciding with the highest number of influenza deaths (671) in the 20-week period. This trend suggests a significant burden on healthcare resources dedicated to respiratory illnesses, potentially indicating a more virulent influenza season or a decrease in population immunity. Healthcare systems may need to allocate additional resources to manage the increased demand for medical care and to bolster preventative measures such as vaccination campaigns.
