Over the last 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual decline in temperature, which has started to increase in the most recent readings, indicating a possible warming trend. Humidity levels showed significant variation, with particularly high levels recorded in the last couple of hours, which could suggest the development of fog or mist. Air pressure was generally high and stable throughout the period, but there was a sharp drop followed by a significant rise towards the end, potentially signaling a fast-moving weather system passing through the area. Wind speeds were mostly moderate but dropped to nearly calm conditions at times, possibly contributing to the spike in humidity due to reduced air circulation. Wind direction was variable, predominantly from the north, shifting to westerly and then southerly directions, which may have influenced the temperature fluctuations observed.
