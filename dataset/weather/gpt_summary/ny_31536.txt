Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching a peak in the late afternoon before cooling slightly towards the evening. Humidity levels were significantly high during the early hours but saw a sharp decline later in the day, indicating a transition to much drier conditions. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting stable weather patterns without the immediate presence of significant frontal systems. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate but increased significantly towards the evening, with a notable shift in wind direction from southerly to northwesterly. These changes in wind speed and direction, coupled with the drop in humidity, might suggest the passage of a weather front and the potential for clearer and cooler conditions following the frontâ€™s passage.
