Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has shown a gradual increase reaching its peak during the late afternoon before slightly cooling down, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels were consistently high throughout the period, suggesting a muggy atmosphere, but there was a noticeable drop during the hottest part of the day, which is characteristic of the inverse relationship between temperature and relative humidity. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a minor fluctuation, but overall, it showed a slight decreasing trend, which could potentially signal an approaching weather system or front. Wind speeds were mostly calm, with a slight increase observed later in the day, which might contribute to a change in weather patterns if sustained. Wind direction varied, predominantly coming from the south, which in Houston is often associated with warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico, potentially contributing to the high humidity levels experienced.
