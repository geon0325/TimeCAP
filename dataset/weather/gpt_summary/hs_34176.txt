Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there was a notable increase in temperature during the daytime, which peaked in the late afternoon before a gradual decline towards the evening. Humidity levels were variable, with very high values observed, potentially indicating the presence of considerable moisture in the air and possibly leading to a muggy feeling or the formation of fog, especially when the humidity reached saturation. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with only slight fluctuations, which suggests a period of steady weather without significant fronts or systems moving through the area. Wind speeds were generally light but picked up notably at one point, which may have contributed to brief changes in weather conditions such as sudden gusts or a temporary clearing of the air. The wind direction shifted throughout the day, starting from easterly in the early hours, becoming variable, and then predominantly southerly, before a notable westerly wind occurred, indicating the passage of a weather system or frontal boundary through the region.
