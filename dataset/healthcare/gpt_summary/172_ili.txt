The analysis of the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data over the last 20 weeks indicates a gradual decline in the overall percentage ratio of ILI patients, followed by a recent uptick in the last few weeks. The ILI incidence in all age groups showed a decreasing trend, with the most significant reduction observed in the youngest age group (0-4 years), but recent weeks have seen an increase across all demographics. Despite the recent increase, the ILI ratio remains well below the baseline of 2.9%, suggesting that the overall ILI activity is still low within the population. The age group of 5-24 years consistently reported the highest number of ILI cases, which could be attributed to higher social mixing and potential transmission settings such as schools and universities. The observed trends and current increase in ILI cases could indicate the start of an upward trend, and continuous monitoring is crucial for early detection of potential outbreaks and ensuring healthcare system preparedness.
