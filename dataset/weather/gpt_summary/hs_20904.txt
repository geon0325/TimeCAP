Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a subtle yet steady increase in temperature, indicating a gradual warming trend. The relative humidity has experienced fluctuations, with overall higher values during the latter half of the period, suggesting a noticeable mugginess in the air. Air pressure has been on a consistent decline, which could be indicative of an approaching weather system that may lead to changes in the current conditions. Wind speeds have generally remained moderate but have seen a slight increase in the last few hours, possibly affecting the feel of the temperature due to wind chill factors. The wind direction has been predominantly from the south-southeast, which is typical for this region and may be contributing to the increase in both temperature and humidity.
