Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a slight upward trend in temperature, indicating a gradual warming. Humidity levels have remained consistently high and even reached saturation, which could suggest a chance of fog or drizzle, particularly in areas where such conditions are conducive. Air pressure has shown a subtle decreasing trend, which is often associated with the approach of a low-pressure system that could lead to weather instability or precipitation. Wind speeds have been relatively gentle and consistent, with no significant gusts or drops, which suggests a stable weather pattern in terms of wind-related events. Wind direction has been variable but predominantly from the east to southeast, which is typical for Houston and could contribute to the high humidity levels due to the flow of moist air from the Gulf of Mexico.
