Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with an overall increasing trend, closing higher by approximately 2.67% from the initial value, indicating a possible positive sentiment among investors. The VIX, often referred to as the market's "fear gauge," experienced a significant spike mid-period, suggesting a brief surge in market uncertainty, but has since trended downwards, aligning with the recovery in equity prices. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 indices have similarly exhibited upward trajectories, with the Nikkei 225 showing a notable rise, which aligns with global equity market gains, while the FTSE 100's movement has been more subdued, reflecting ongoing market-specific factors. Commodity prices have seen mixed trends, with Gold Futures declining by 6.26%, indicating a shift away from safe-haven assets, while Crude Oil Futures have increased by 9.67%, potentially signaling expectations of economic recovery and increased energy demand. Exchange rates have remained relatively stable, with slight depreciation of the USD against the JPY and CNY, which could impact international trade dynamics and foreign investment in the respective economies.
