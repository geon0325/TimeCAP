Over the last 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have experienced a typical diurnal cycle with cooler conditions prevailing during the early hours and a noticeable warming trend peaking in the afternoon. Humidity levels showed an inverse relationship with temperature, as they were highest during the coolest parts of the day and decreased significantly as temperatures rose, possibly indicating the presence of morning dew and drier conditions by the afternoon. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with a slight fluctuation that may not have significantly impacted the weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally light, with a period of calm conditions around the middle of the day; however, towards the end of the 24-hour period, there was an increase in wind speed that could contribute to changes in upcoming weather patterns. The predominant wind direction was from the south to southeast, shifting to the south later on, which is consistent with warm air advection typical for Houston and could be responsible for the warmer temperatures observed.
