Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual decline in temperature, indicative of a typical diurnal cooling trend leading into the nighttime hours. Humidity levels have shown fluctuation but ended on a significantly higher note, suggesting an increase in moisture in the air, which could lead to morning fog or dew. Air pressure has been relatively stable with a slight increasing trend, which is generally associated with calm and stable weather conditions. Wind speeds have varied, with periods of calm and gustier conditions, but overall they have not been extreme, which means wind has likely had a modest impact on the perceived temperature and dispersion of pollutants. Wind direction has been predominantly from the north and northwest, which in Houston can often signal the approach or presence of a frontal system, potentially affecting temperatures and precipitation patterns.
