Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual decline in temperature, which is typical as the day transitions into nighttime, followed by a steady increase during the daytime, suggesting a normal diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels showed an increasing trend overnight, reaching a peak during the early morning hours, then decreased during the day, which could have led to a perception of mugginess in the early hours but more comfort later on. The air pressure saw a steady increase throughout the period, indicating a stable and possibly improving weather pattern with no immediate signs of significant weather disturbances. Wind speeds remained mostly light but picked up slightly during the afternoon, which may have contributed to a slight relief in the higher humidity levels experienced earlier in the day. Wind direction was relatively constant, with a minor shift observed, suggesting a stable weather pattern without drastic changes in wind patterns.
