Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a mild and relatively stable temperature range, with a gradual increase observed as the day progressed. Humidity levels were high, often reaching saturation, which could have contributed to foggy conditions or a feeling of dampness in the air. Air pressure remained notably consistent, staying within a narrow range, indicative of stable weather conditions without significant disturbances. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate and showed a slight decrease during the middle of the time period, which might have contributed to less dispersion of any fog or mist. The wind direction varied but predominantly came from the southwest, which is typical for coastal San Francisco and can bring in maritime air masses over the city.
