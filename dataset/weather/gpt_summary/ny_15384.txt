Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, indicative of a warming trend. Humidity levels decreased significantly, which, when coupled with rising temperatures, suggests a drier and potentially less comfortable atmosphere. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight decrease towards the end of the observed period, which might indicate the approach of a weather system that could alter current conditions. Wind speeds varied moderately but remained mostly gentle to moderate, with no significant gusts observed. The wind direction shifted predominantly from the northwest to the west and then veered towards the southwest, suggesting a change in the weather pattern that could be bringing in the warmer air contributing to the temperature increase.
