The time-series data on Influenza-like Illness (ILI) over the last 20 weeks reveals a downward trend in the overall number of patients seeking healthcare services, with a notable decrease in ILI cases across all age groups. Despite this general decline, the ratio of ILI patients has recently experienced a slight uptick, surpassing the 1% threshold in the most recent data point but remaining well below the baseline of 2.9% used to signal significant influenza activity. The largest absolute number of ILI cases is consistently observed in the 5-24 age group, which could indicate higher transmission rates or greater susceptibility within this demographic. The least affected age group is those aged 65 or more, which might reflect the impact of targeted vaccination campaigns or inherent differences in social behavior and exposure. These trends suggest that while the influenza situation is currently stable and under the epidemic threshold, health systems must remain vigilant for potential changes in ILI patterns, particularly given the recent increase in the ILI ratio.
