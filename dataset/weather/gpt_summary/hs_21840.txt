Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a slight decrease in temperature followed by a gradual warming trend, which is typical of diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels have shown an inverse correlation with temperature, peaking during the cooler early morning hours and decreasing as temperatures rose. Air pressure has been on a gentle decline, suggesting a possible gradual shift in weather patterns or the approach of a weather system. Winds have been relatively gentle and consistent, primarily blowing from the south-southeast, which is common for this region and can contribute to moisture transport from the Gulf of Mexico. The combined weather indicators do not suggest any extreme weather events, but the gradual pressure drop could indicate potential changes in the near future.
