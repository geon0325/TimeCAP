Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before starting to decrease slightly towards the evening. Relative humidity showed significant fluctuations, with a noticeable peak of saturation, which could have contributed to a sense of mugginess during that time. Air pressure has been relatively stable, with a slight overall decrease, suggesting a stable weather pattern with no immediate indication of severe weather events. Wind speeds varied, including a period of increased velocity, which may have provided some relief from the humidity. The predominant wind direction was southerly, with some variability, which is typical for Houston and can influence the moisture levels in the air as it often brings moisture from the Gulf of Mexico.
