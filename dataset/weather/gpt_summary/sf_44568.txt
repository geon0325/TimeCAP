Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a remarkable consistency in weather conditions, with no observed fluctuations in temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed, or wind direction. The temperature remained unusually high, indicative of a heatwave situation, which is atypical for the coastal climate of San Francisco. With persistent low humidity, the atmosphere may feel dry, increasing the risk of dehydration and potential wildfire occurrence. Steady air pressure suggests stable weather patterns without the immediate likelihood of significant weather changes such as storms or fronts passing through. The wind has been gentle and maintained a constant direction, which may have provided some relief from the heat but would not significantly disrupt any outdoor activities.
