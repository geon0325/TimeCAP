Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable diurnal temperature variation, typical of the region, with the lowest temperatures recorded at dawn and a gradual increase to a peak in the late afternoon. Humidity levels have shown fluctuations, remaining moderate on average, but have decreased significantly towards the latter part of the day, which could suggest drier conditions moving into the area. Air pressure has been relatively stable, with a slight increase throughout the day, indicating a period of fair weather and possibly contributing to the lower humidity levels observed. Wind speeds have varied, with some calm periods, but mostly light to moderate breezes have prevailed, and the wind direction has been predominantly from the north-northwest. This consistent wind pattern, along with the other indicators, suggests stable weather conditions are likely to persist in the short term.
