Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia to total deaths has shown a gradual increase, from an initial 5.36% to 6.17%, which is still below the average ratio of 7.84%. The number of deaths from Influenza has risen significantly from single digits to 56, indicating a potential uptick in flu cases or severity. Meanwhile, deaths from pneumonia have also increased from 2762 to 3399, suggesting a persistent prevalence of pneumonia-related issues. The overall number of deaths has also been on an upward trajectory, from 51645 to 55967, which may put additional strain on healthcare resources. This increasing trend in both specific and total mortality could indicate a growing health concern that warrants closer monitoring and possibly enhanced public health interventions.
