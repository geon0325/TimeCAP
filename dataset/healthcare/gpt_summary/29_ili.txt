Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a persistent rise in the proportion of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases among all age groups, with the highest increments observed in the youngest age bracket (0-4 years) followed by school-age children and young adults (5-24 years). While the overall number of patients has fluctuated, the ratio of ILI patients has consistently increased, indicating a growing prevalence of ILI symptoms relative to the total number of patients seen. Despite the increase, the ratio of ILI patients has remained well below the baseline of 2.9% used to determine heightened influenza activity. The continuous growth in ILI cases among the older population groups, particularly those aged 50 and above, is concerning as these age groups are typically more vulnerable to complications from influenza. The current trend, if sustained or increased, could potentially strain healthcare resources and necessitate preemptive public health measures to mitigate spread and impact, especially among high-risk populations.
