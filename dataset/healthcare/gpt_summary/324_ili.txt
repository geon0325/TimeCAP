Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable upward trend in the ratio of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) patients, with the most recent data approaching the baseline for determining an active influenza situation. The patient count for ILI has increased across all age groups, with the highest increment observed in the 25-49 age bracket, suggesting this demographic may be particularly affected during the current period. While the youngest age group (0-4) initially had the highest number of ILI patients, the largest recent increases have been in the 25-49 and 5-24 age groups, indicating a shift in the age distribution of ILI cases. The 50-64 and 65+ age groups, though starting with fewer ILI cases, have also shown a steady rise, potentially indicating increased susceptibility or reporting in these populations. These trends suggest a growing burden on healthcare resources, emphasizing the need for heightened surveillance, preventive measures, and possibly increased healthcare services tailored to the most affected age groups.
