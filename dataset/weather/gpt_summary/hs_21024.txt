Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has shown minor fluctuations but generally remained consistent, with a slight warming trend observed in the more recent hours. Humidity levels have been high throughout the period, reaching saturation multiple times, which could indicate the presence of fog or mist, especially during the early morning hours. Air pressure has been steadily decreasing, suggesting a gradual change in weather patterns, which could potentially lead to cloudier skies or precipitation if the trend continues. Wind speeds have been relatively light but experienced a slight increase later in the day, with a notable shift in wind direction from predominantly northeasterly to a more northwesterly direction, possibly indicating the passage of a weather front. Overall, the combination of high humidity, decreasing air pressure, and changing wind patterns could suggest the potential for unsettled weather conditions in the near future.
