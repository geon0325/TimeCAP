Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before stabilizing. Humidity levels showed a significant decrease as the day progressed, indicative of a drier atmosphere moving into the area. Air pressure experienced a slight but steady decline throughout the period, which could suggest a gradual change in weather patterns, potentially leading to instability in the coming days. Wind speeds remained generally light with minimal variation, although there was a notable shift in wind direction from predominantly westerly to a more varied pattern, including easterly and northerly breezes. This shift in wind direction, along with the lowering humidity and air pressure, could contribute to changes in the local climate, possibly bringing cooler conditions or increasing the chance of precipitation.
