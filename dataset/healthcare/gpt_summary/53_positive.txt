Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant upward trend in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the ratio of positive specimens increasing from 1.36% to 24.73%. The increase suggests a substantial rise in influenza activity, with the ratio well above the 20-week average of 6.26%. Influenza A has been the predominant subtype, with its highest positive specimen ratio reaching 20.21%, but there has also been a notable rise in Influenza B, peaking at a 6.23% positivity rate in the latest week. This surge in influenza cases could strain healthcare resources, requiring increased vigilance and possibly adjustments in clinical treatment, vaccination strategies, and public health responses. The consistent growth in the number of positive cases week over week also underscores the need for ongoing monitoring and potential preparedness for a continued increase in influenza-related healthcare demand.
