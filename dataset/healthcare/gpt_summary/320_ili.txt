Over the past 20 weeks, the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) activity has shown a gradual increase in the percentage of patients across all age groups, with the ratio of ILI patients consistently rising above the baseline. The most significant increases were observed in the youngest age group (0-4 years), indicating a heightened vulnerability or increased transmission within this demographic. Despite fluctuations, older age groups (50-64 and 65 or more) have demonstrated more moderate increases in ILI cases compared to the younger populations. This upward trend in ILI percentages suggests a growing burden on healthcare resources, particularly in pediatric care services, as the ILI rates surpass the established baseline threshold. Healthcare systems may need to prepare for continued strain and consider bolstering preventive measures, especially in early childhood settings, to mitigate the impact of rising ILI cases.
