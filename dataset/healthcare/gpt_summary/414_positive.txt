Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a clear upward trend in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the rate more than doubling from 6.26% to 16.14%. Influenza A has consistently been more prevalent than Influenza B, though both have shown significant increases in positive specimens. The highest weekly jump in positive specimen percentages occurred between weeks 13 and 14, with Influenza A showing a particularly sharp rise. Despite Influenza A's dominance, in the most recent weeks, there has been a notable increase in the ratio of Influenza B positive specimens, suggesting a shift in the circulating strains. This trend indicates a growing burden on healthcare resources, emphasizing the need for heightened public health measures and preparedness for an increased number of influenza cases.
