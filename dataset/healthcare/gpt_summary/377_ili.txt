Over the last 20 weeks, the proportion of ILI cases among the total number of patients peaked at 2.67% in week nine, followed by a subsequent decline to 1.52% by week 20, remaining below the benchmark severity threshold of 2.9%. The highest number of ILI cases was reported in the 5-24 age group, with a peak in week eight, which then showed a notable decrease, aligning with the overall downward trend in ILI proportions. The 0-4 age group consistently reported the second-highest number of ILI cases, with a slight decrease observed toward the end of the 20-week period. Although the total number of patients presented fluctuations, it did not significantly impact the overall downward trend of ILI case percentages. Given the ILI case proportions are below the threshold and on a declining trend, the healthcare system may currently be experiencing a reprieve from influenza pressures, allowing for resource reallocation to other areas if needed.
