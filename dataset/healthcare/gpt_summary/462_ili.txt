The time-series data for the last 20 weeks indicates a sustained increase in Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases across all age groups, with the percentage of ILI patients consistently exceeding the 2.9% severity benchmark. The highest rates of ILI were observed in the age group of 5-24, followed by those aged 25-49, suggesting that younger populations are currently the most affected. The peak ILI percentage of 6.90% occurred in week six of the time series, indicating a significant strain on the healthcare system during this period. Since this peak, there has been a gradual decline in the ratio of ILI patients, yet the percentage remains above the severity threshold, suggesting the system continues to face elevated demands. The consistent elevation above the benchmark calls for sustained healthcare resources and public health measures to manage the ongoing ILI incidence and prevent potential healthcare system overload.
