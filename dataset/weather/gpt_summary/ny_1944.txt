Over the last 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, peaking during the midday hours before a notable decline towards the evening. Humidity levels were relatively high throughout the day, which is typical for the city's climate, but they showed a slight decrease later in the night, suggesting a drier atmosphere moving in. Air pressure has been steadily dropping, indicative of a developing low-pressure system that could lead to unsettled weather conditions, including potential precipitation or storms. Wind speeds have been variable but generally increased through the day, with the strongest gusts occurring in the afternoon, which could have amplified the wind chill effect. The wind direction shifted significantly from predominantly easterly to westerly directions, hinting at the passage of a weather front and the possible arrival of a new air mass with different characteristics.
