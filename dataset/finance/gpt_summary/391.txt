Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a general uptrend, increasing from 3276.02 to 3389.78, indicative of a positive sentiment in the US equity market. The VIX, which measures market volatility, has gradually decreased from 24.32 to 21.51, suggesting that investors' fear and uncertainty have been subsiding. In contrast, the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 have shown mixed performance with some volatility, ending slightly lower than their starting points, reflecting regional market uncertainties and perhaps local economic concerns. Gold Futures have risen sharply from 1864.10 to 1999.40, signaling a flight to safety as investors hedge against potential market downturns and inflation. Currency markets have seen the Euro and Japanese Yen strengthen against the US Dollar, with the EUR/USD rising from 1.15 to 1.19 and the USD/JPY falling from 106.83 to 106.00, which could be indicative of a weakening dollar environment, while the USD/CNY has remained relatively stable, ending slightly lower at 6.93, showing resilience in the Chinese Yuan amidst global currency fluctuations.
