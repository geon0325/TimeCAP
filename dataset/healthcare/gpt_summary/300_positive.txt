Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable increase in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the overall average being 6.26%. The data shows a significant upward trend, particularly in the last four weeks, where the ratio of positive specimens surged from 0.25% to 1.00%. Influenza A has been the predominant strain with its positivity ratio escalating dramatically from 0.19% to 0.94% in the same period, whereas Influenza B has shown a more stable presence with a slight increase from 0.06% to 0.06%. The total number of specimens tested has also increased over the period, peaking at 72,905 in the most recent week, which could indicate a rise in suspected influenza cases. This trend suggests a growing burden on the healthcare system, emphasizing the need for increased vigilance, resource allocation for testing and treatment, and potentially wider public health messaging about flu prevention measures.
