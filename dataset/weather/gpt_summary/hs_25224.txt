Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature, reaching its peak during the afternoon and gradually decreasing towards the early hours of the following day, indicative of typical diurnal patterns. Humidity levels were relatively high, peaking at night and early morning, which is common in coastal cities like Houston and may have contributed to a feeling of mugginess. Air pressure experienced a slight variability, with a notable increase during the day, which could be associated with transient weather systems passing through the area. Wind speeds were generally moderate but did show some hour-to-hour variation, with calmer winds observed during the nighttime. The wind direction was predominantly from the south, shifting slightly throughout the day, which is characteristic of the Gulf of Mexico's influence on Houston's weather.
