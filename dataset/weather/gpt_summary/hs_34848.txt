Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a slight decrease in temperature, indicating a marginal cooling trend. Humidity levels remained high throughout the period, suggesting a muggy atmosphere that could potentially lead to discomfort for residents and the development of localized weather phenomena such as fog or mist. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight fluctuation that doesn't seem to indicate any immediate, significant weather changes. Wind speeds were generally low to moderate, with a period of calm winds, and then slightly increasing, which could contribute to a slight relief from the high humidity levels. The wind direction was predominantly from the southeast, shifting to northeasterly during a brief period before returning to a southerly direction, which is typical for Houston and may continue to bring warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico.
