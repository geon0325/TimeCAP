Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have demonstrated a typical diurnal pattern with a peak in the late afternoon, indicative of warm and potentially uncomfortable conditions for the area. Humidity levels have fluctuated significantly, reaching saturation during the early morning hours, which could have led to the formation of fog or dew, and then decreasing substantially towards the evening, suggesting a possible sense of dryness or relief from the earlier mugginess. Air pressure has remained relatively stable with a slight increase in the midday hours, typical of a settled weather pattern, but a decrease towards the end of the period could signal an approaching change in weather conditions. Wind speeds have been mostly light, with a slight increase in the late afternoon, offering little respite from the heat, and the wind direction has varied, with shifts from southeasterly to northeasterly and back, which may influence local temperature and humidity levels. Overall, the weather in Houston has been warm with variable humidity, and the slight changes in air pressure and wind conditions could indicate transitions in the weather pattern soon.
