Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before a slight cooling trend in the evening. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuation, with a notable increase during the early morning hours, indicative of potential early morning fog or dew, followed by a sharp decrease as temperatures peaked, which would have led to drier conditions in the afternoon. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day with only minor variations, suggesting a steady weather pattern without immediate indications of significant weather fronts or storms moving into the area. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with a brief period of calm winds in the early evening, and the prevailing wind direction was northerly, shifting slightly throughout the day but with a noticeable deviation to the northwest and then to the northeast in the early hours. The consistency in wind direction and speed, combined with the stable pressure and the temperature and humidity variations, point towards typical weather patterns for Houston without immediate concerns for severe weather.
