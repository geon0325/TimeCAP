Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the mortality ratio of influenza and pneumonia compared to total deaths, peaking at 10.89% in the 10th week and reaching a low of 5.99% in the first week. The highest number of deaths from influenza occurred in the 10th week (1626 deaths), which coincides with the peak mortality ratio, indicating a potential outbreak or seasonal surge. Despite a general downward trend in total deaths from a high in the 8th week (66134 deaths) to the 20th week (54918 deaths), the number of deaths from pneumonia has remained relatively constant, with a slight decrease over time, suggesting it continues to be a significant health concern. The mortality ratio from influenza or pneumonia has decreased from its peak, but it still remains below the 20-week average in the last reported week at 7.40%, indicating a potential easing of the burden on healthcare resources. This data underscores the importance of ongoing surveillance and vaccination efforts for influenza and the need for continued attention to pneumonia as a persistent health risk.
