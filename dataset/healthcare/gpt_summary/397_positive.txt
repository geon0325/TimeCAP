Over the last 20 weeks, the data shows a fluctuating but overall increasing trend in the number of respiratory specimens tested for influenza, with the numbers ranging from 30,289 in week 8 to 61,810 in week 20. Despite this increase in testing, the percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza has remained relatively stable, with a slight upward trend from 0.72% in week 16 to 0.93% in week 20, staying below the 20-week average of 6.26%. Influenza A has consistently shown a higher positivity rate compared to Influenza B, with a recent increase from 0.47% in week 16 to 0.58% in week 20, which suggests a growing prevalence of Influenza A. In contrast, Influenza B's positivity rate has decreased since the beginning of the time series from 0.78% in week 1 to stabilizing at 0.35% in weeks 19 and 20. These trends may indicate a shift in the dominant influenza strain and could have implications for treatment strategies and vaccine formulation in the healthcare system.
