Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable decline in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the highest rates observed at the beginning of the time series and a steady decrease thereafter. The ratio of positive specimens peaked in Week 5 with 28.28% and has since dropped to 0.33% by Week 20, indicating a significant reduction in influenza activity. Influenza A showed a more pronounced peak (18.03% in Week 7) than Influenza B (17.59% in Week 1), but both subtypes have experienced a substantial decrease in detection rates, with Influenza A at 0.16% and Influenza B at 0.17% by Week 20. The overall decline in influenza incidence suggests that the strain on healthcare resources attributed to influenza-related illnesses may be lessening. However, continued surveillance is necessary to monitor for potential resurgences or new variants that may impact infection rates and healthcare demands.
