Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature, initially seeing a mild decrease before warming up again towards the latter part of the period. Humidity levels started relatively high and increased further, reaching a peak, which suggests a muggy atmosphere throughout the city. Air pressure remained largely stable at first but exhibited a gradual decline later on, which could indicate an approaching weather system or a change in the current weather pattern. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a slight increase by the end of the period, potentially contributing to cooler perceived temperatures and dispersal of humidity. The wind direction was predominantly from the south-southeast, which is typical for Houston and may have contributed to the warm and humid conditions experienced.
