Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a gradual increase in the percentage of patients with Influenza-like Illness (ILI) across all age groups, suggesting a rising trend in ILI activity within the population. The ratio of ILI patients has consistently remained below the baseline threshold, indicating that the ILI incidence has not reached levels typically associated with an intense influenza outbreak. However, there was a peak in the ratio of ILI patients, which could signal a temporary surge in infections that warrants close monitoring. The highest number of ILI cases was reported among the age group 25-49, which may indicate a higher susceptibility or greater exposure to infection within this demographic. The trend in the data underscores the importance of ongoing surveillance and preventive measures, such as vaccination and public health education, especially in age groups showing higher ILI activity.
