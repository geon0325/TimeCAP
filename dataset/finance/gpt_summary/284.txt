Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has experienced a significant decline, indicating a bearish trend and potential investor uncertainty; the index dropped by approximately 25% from 3386.15 to 2529.19. The VIX, reflecting market volatility, has more than quintupled, soaring from 14.38 to 75.91, which suggests a substantial increase in market risk and investor anxiety. Globally, the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 also faced severe drops of roughly 27% and 29% respectively, revealing widespread market distress. Gold Futures, typically a safe-haven asset, have seen increased volatility with an initial rise followed by a decrease, though they ended slightly lower than they began, moving from 1607.50 to 1524.90. The crude oil futures collapsed by nearly 49%, moving from 53.29 to 26.95, highlighting the potential for significant stress in the energy sector, while major currency pairs like EUR/USD and USD/JPY have shown relative stability, suggesting that forex markets are less perturbed than equity and commodities markets.
