Over the past 20 weeks, the data shows a fluctuating trend in the ratio of positive specimens for influenza, with an overall average positivity rate of 6.26%. The number of specimens tested for influenza has decreased from 82,274 to 32,425, suggesting a possible reduction in testing demand or availability. Notably, Influenza B positivity rates started higher than Influenza A, but the trend reversed in recent weeks, with Influenza A now showing a higher positivity percentage, indicating a potential shift in the dominant strain. The peak positivity rate for any given week was 1.31%, which is significantly higher than the average, indicating a potential spike in infections during that period. These findings could suggest the need for increased vigilance in monitoring for potential outbreaks and ensuring adequate healthcare resources are allocated for influenza management.
