Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have shown a diurnal pattern, with a peak during the late afternoon and a gradual decrease overnight, which is typical for the region. Humidity levels have remained relatively high throughout the day, with the highest values occurring during the early morning hours, potentially contributing to a muggy feeling. Air pressure has been relatively stable, with only minor fluctuations indicating a period of steady weather conditions. Wind speeds have varied, increasing towards the evening, which could help in dispersing humidity and providing some relief from the high moisture levels. The wind direction has been predominantly from the south to southeast, which is common for Houston and may bring in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, affecting local weather patterns.
