Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual increase in temperature following a cooler start to the period, indicative of a typical diurnal warming pattern. The humidity level remained high throughout, with several hours at full saturation, suggesting a possibility of fog or mist, particularly during the cooler early morning hours when the temperature was at its lowest. Air pressure has been steadily high but showed a slight decreasing trend, which could imply a change in the weather pattern in the near future, although the change is subtle at this stage. Wind speeds have been consistently light, which tends to limit dispersion of air pollutants and may result in lower air quality in urban areas. The wind direction has been predominantly from the northeast, with minor variations, which is common for the region and can influence coastal conditions and temperature patterns.
