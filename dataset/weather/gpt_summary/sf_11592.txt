Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperature exhibited a gradual increase, indicating a warming trend throughout the day that led to comfortable conditions, especially by the late afternoon and evening. Humidity levels remained relatively high for the majority of the period, which may have contributed to a perception of mugginess, despite the moderate temperatures. Atmospheric pressure was consistently high and showed a slight increase, suggesting stable weather conditions. Wind speeds were mostly light, with a period of calm conditions around midday; however, there was a noticeable spike in wind speed towards the end of the 24-hour period. Wind direction varied significantly but predominantly came from the north and west, shifting to a strong westerly flow at the end of the observed time frame, which could bring in cooler air from the Pacific Ocean.
