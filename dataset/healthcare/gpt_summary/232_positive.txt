The data indicates a notable decline in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza over the last 20 weeks, with an initial peak ratio of 7.50% dropping to 0.13% in the most recent week, well below the 20-week average of 6.26%. Influenza A has shown a more significant decrease than Influenza B, with its positivity ratio falling from 5.65% to just 0.05%, suggesting that Influenza A was the primary driver of earlier influenza cases. Conversely, Influenza B has maintained a more consistent, albeit still decreasing, presence with its ratio only slightly changing from 1.85% to 0.08%. The overall downward trend in influenza positivity rates suggests that the spread of influenza is currently well-controlled, which could potentially lead to a reduction in healthcare resource allocation for influenza management. However, continued surveillance is necessary to monitor for potential resurgences, especially considering the fluctuations in weekly testing volumes and the possibility of seasonal variations.
