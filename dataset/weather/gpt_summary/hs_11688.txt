Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a gradual increase in temperature, peaking during the latter part of the day before a slight decrease towards the evening. The humidity levels have generally been high, with a slight decrease during the midday hours, suggesting a muggy atmosphere that could have felt quite oppressive, especially when temperatures were at their highest. Air pressure showed a minor fluctuating trend with a notable decrease later in the day, which could indicate the potential development of unsettled weather conditions. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate throughout the day, with some variability in intensity but no significant gusts or calm periods. The wind direction was predominantly from the southeast to the south, characteristic of Houston's typical weather patterns, which often bring moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, contributing to the humidity felt in the area.
