Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a noticeable fluctuation in temperature, with a significant drop during the night followed by a sharp rise towards the end of the period. Humidity levels varied inversely with temperature, reaching their peak when the temperature was at its lowest, suggesting a possible early morning or late evening fog that is typical for the city. Air pressure remained stable throughout the day, indicating a steady weather pattern without the immediate influence of any frontal systems. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, increasing during the day which could have contributed to the dispersal of any coastal fog or low clouds. Wind direction was predominantly from the east-northeast, shifting towards the southeast later on, which is consistent with a typical wind pattern for the region and could affect coastal and marine conditions.
