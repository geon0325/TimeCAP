Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable increase in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the average ratio of positive specimens rising from 1.50% to 12.72%. The data shows a significant surge in Influenza A detections, which rose from 1.12% to 12.20%, accounting for the majority of the increase in overall positivity rates. Meanwhile, the ratio of Influenza B positive specimens has shown smaller fluctuations, remaining under 1% in most weeks and peaking at 0.59%. The peak positivity rate for all specimens reached 16.35% in week 18, indicating a substantial spike which could hint at a wave of influenza infections. This trend suggests a potential strain on healthcare resources and highlights the importance of influenza surveillance, vaccination, and preventive measures, especially during times when the positivity rates are significantly above the 20-week average of 6.26%.
