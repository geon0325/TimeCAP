Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a consistent decline in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the baseline average of 7.84%, with the most recent data indicating a ratio of 5.48%. The total number of deaths due to all causes remained relatively stable, fluctuating around the 50,000 mark weekly. However, deaths attributed specifically to influenza showed a downward trend, with the latest figures being significantly lower than those at the start of the timeline. Pneumonia-related deaths also decreased over the period but remained the more significant contributor to the overall mortality from these conditions. This downward trend in mortality ratios suggests an improvement in the control or treatment of these respiratory diseases but should be monitored for possible fluctuations that could strain healthcare resources.
