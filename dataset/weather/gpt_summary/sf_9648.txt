Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature from early in the period, reaching a low in the early hours, before warming up again towards the end of the observed time frame. Humidity levels varied significantly, with lower values during the day which increased notably into the night and early morning, indicating the presence of more moisture in the air, perhaps contributing to cooler nighttime temperatures and potential morning fog. Air pressure remained relatively stable but showed a slight decreasing trend, which could suggest a minor change in weather patterns or the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds were consistently light throughout the period, suggesting calm weather conditions. Wind direction was predominantly from the west-northwest, except for a brief shift to a southerly direction in the late afternoon, which could have influenced the temporary warming trend observed during that time.
