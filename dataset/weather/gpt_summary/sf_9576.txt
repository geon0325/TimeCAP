Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have exhibited typical diurnal variation, starting and ending the period in a relatively stable range, with a noticeable dip during the cooler early morning hours. Humidity levels remained fairly consistent, with a slight increase during the night, which is expected given the city's proximity to the ocean and can contribute to the formation of the characteristic morning fog. Air pressure showed a gradual and steady increase throughout the period, suggesting stable weather conditions and a high likelihood of continued fair weather. Wind speeds decreased significantly towards the latter part of the day, becoming very calm, which could lead to reduced dispersion of air pollutants, potentially affecting air quality. Wind direction varied greatly, indicating the presence of different air masses and possibly the influence of local geographical features like the Pacific Ocean and the Bay Area's varied topography on the wind patterns.
