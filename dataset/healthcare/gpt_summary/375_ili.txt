Over the past 20 weeks, the total number of patients reporting to healthcare providers has fluctuated, seeing a peak at week 10. The proportion of ILI cases across all age groups has generally followed an upward trend in the earlier weeks, peaking around weeks 9 and 10, with the highest ILI ratio reaching 2.67%, which is below the 2.9% benchmark for severity. Following this peak, there has been a consistent decline in the proportion of ILI cases, with all subsequent weeks remaining below the 2.9% threshold, indicating a lessening burden of influenza-like illnesses on the healthcare system. The age group of 5-24 years consistently reported the highest number of ILI cases throughout the period, suggesting this demographic may be particularly affected or more likely to seek care for such symptoms. However, as of the last reported week, all age groups have seen a decrease in ILI cases, which could suggest a downward trend in ILI activity or effective mitigation efforts, yet continuous monitoring remains essential to manage potential healthcare system impacts.
