Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a peak in the ratio of positive specimens for influenza with a subsequent decline toward the end of the period. The highest positivity rate was observed in week 7 at 26.03% for all specimens, with Influenza A being the dominant strain, peaking at 25.36% in the same week, while Influenza B never surpassed 1.68% of tested specimens. As of the latest week, the overall positivity rate has decreased to 3.54%, with Influenza A and B constituting 1.96% and 1.58% respectively, suggesting a significant reduction in influenza activity. This decline in influenza cases may lead to a reduced burden on healthcare resources, allowing for reallocation to other areas as the flu season wanes. However, continued surveillance is necessary to monitor for potential resurgences or new strains that could impact public health.
