Over the last 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have experienced a slight fluctuation, with a general cooling trend during the early hours followed by a warming trend that peaked towards the later hours. Humidity levels were relatively high but showed a significant decrease as temperatures rose, suggesting a correlation between the two that is typical for coastal climates. Air pressure remained fairly stable, with only slight variations, indicating a period of steady weather without any significant frontal systems moving through the area. Wind speeds were consistently light throughout the period, which would have contributed to the stable weather conditions and minimal wind chill effect. The wind direction varied significantly, with a notable shift from westerly to northerly and then to more varied directions, which could have implications for local weather patterns such as fog dispersion along the coast.
