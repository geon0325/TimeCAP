Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a downward trend, declining from a high of 4662.85 to 4418.64, indicating increased market uncertainty and potential investor caution. The VIX (Volatility Index) corroborates this sentiment, with notable spikes suggesting a period of heightened market volatility, peaking at 31.96 and ending at a still-elevated 27.36. Despite global market pressures, the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 have remained relatively stable, with the Nikkei experiencing a mid-period dip and subsequent recovery, and the FTSE 100 showing a slight overall increase, signaling resilience in these markets. Gold Futures have seen a slight uptrend, moving from 1816.50 to 1840.80, which typically indicates a flight to safety by investors in times of market turbulence. Crude Oil Futures have experienced a significant increase, ending at 93.10 from an initial 83.82, potentially suggesting expectations of growing demand or concerns over supply constraints, while major currency pairs such as EUR/USD and USD/JPY have shown minor fluctuations, hinting at a cautious forex market.
