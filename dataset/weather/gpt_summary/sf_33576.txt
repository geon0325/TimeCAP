Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual decrease in temperature followed by a significant rise towards the later hours, indicating a typical diurnal pattern with cooler conditions at night and warmer temperatures by day. Humidity levels were relatively high throughout the period but showed a noticeable decrease in the afternoon, which could have contributed to the sensation of a more comfortable and less muggy atmosphere. Air pressure increased steadily throughout much of the day, suggesting a stable weather pattern, but a subsequent sharp decrease may indicate the approach of a weather system that could lead to changes in conditions. Wind speeds varied, with some gustier conditions in the earlier hours that calmed significantly, followed by a slight increase towards the end of the period, possibly affecting the dispersion of air pollutants and sea breezes. The wind direction showed a shift from northerly to westerly and then to northerly again, which is characteristic of the changing wind patterns in coastal areas like San Francisco.
