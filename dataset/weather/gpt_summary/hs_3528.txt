Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature that peaked in the late afternoon before cooling down significantly towards the end of the period. Humidity levels were high during the night and early morning, contributing to a muggy feeling, but they dropped sharply during the afternoon, likely making the higher temperatures feel more bearable. Air pressure has shown a slight decreasing trend, indicating a possible change in weather patterns or the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds have generally been mild but picked up considerably towards the end of the period, with a notable shift in wind direction from predominantly easterly to a westerly direction by the close of the 24-hour window. These changes, particularly the increasing wind speed and shift in direction, combined with the falling air pressure, could suggest the development of unsettled weather conditions in the near future.
