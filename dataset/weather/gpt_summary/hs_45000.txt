Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the afternoon before slightly cooling down towards the evening. Humidity levels have shown notable fluctuations, with a relative increase during nighttime hours, indicative of a higher likelihood of morning dew or fog formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period but has shown a slight declining trend recently, which could indicate an approaching weather system or front. Wind speed has been mostly gentle to light with some variability, and the predominant wind direction has been from the north to northeast, shifting more easterly and southeasterly at times, which may influence local temperature and humidity levels. Overall, the weather in Houston has been stable, but the recent drop in air pressure and change in wind direction could suggest that changes may be on the horizon.
