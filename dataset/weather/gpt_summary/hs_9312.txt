Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a mild temperature decrease during the early hours, followed by a gradual increase towards the afternoon and stabilizing towards the evening. Humidity levels showed significant variation, with higher levels observed during the early morning, indicative of possible morning mists, and lower levels during midday and the evening, suggesting drier conditions. Air pressure readings were relatively high and increased throughout the day, which typically correlates with stable and dry weather patterns. Wind speeds were mostly light with a period of increased intensity around midday, which could have contributed to a temporary dispersion of humidity and a clearer sky. The wind direction was variable, with notable shifts from north-easterly to south-easterly, and then predominantly westerly directions, which may have influenced the temperature and humidity changes observed.
