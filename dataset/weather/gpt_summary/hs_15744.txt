Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature showed a notable diurnal variation, with a peak during the late afternoon and a gradual decline overnight into the early morning. Humidity levels were relatively high and consistent, suggesting a muggy and potentially uncomfortable atmosphere, with a slight decrease during the afternoon hours which is typical due to the increase in temperature. Air pressure remained fairly stable, indicating no significant weather disturbances or fronts passing through the area. Wind speeds were generally light to gentle and showed minimal variation, which likely contributed to the persistently high humidity by not dispersing moisture-laden air. The wind direction shifted throughout the day, with more variability in the evening and night, suggesting a change in local weather patterns that could influence upcoming conditions.
