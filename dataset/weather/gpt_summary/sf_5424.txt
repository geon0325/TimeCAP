Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature with a general cooling trend during the early hours, followed by a gradual increase towards the afternoon before stabilizing in the evening. Relative humidity levels varied significantly, starting with moderate values before dropping considerably and then increasing again, indicative of a change in atmospheric moisture that could have affected the perceived comfort level. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, suggesting steady weather conditions without significant fronts or storms passing through the region. Wind speeds were moderate with occasional calm periods and a subsequent increase, which could have contributed to the dispersion of any fog or low clouds, a common feature of San Franciscoâ€™s microclimate. Wind direction shifted predominantly between southwesterly and northwesterly, which is typical for the coastal environment of the city and can influence the temperature and fog distribution along the bay.
