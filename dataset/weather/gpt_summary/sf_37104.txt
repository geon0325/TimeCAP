Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature, indicating a typical variation between nighttime and daytime conditions for the region. Humidity levels saw significant changes, with a notable peak suggesting the possibility of early morning fog or mist that later cleared as humidity levels dropped substantially, a common pattern along the coast. Air pressure remained relatively stable with some minor variations, maintaining conditions that are consistent with settled weather without any significant storm systems approaching the area. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with occasional higher gusts that could have been felt more strongly in exposed areas or along the waterfront. The wind direction varied but predominantly came from a northerly direction, shifting to southerly at times, which is typical of the variable wind patterns seen in this urban coastal environment.
