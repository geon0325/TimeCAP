Over the past 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a consistent upward trend, increasing from 2803.27 to 2964.33, indicating a positive sentiment among investors about the prospects of the U.S. economy and corporate earnings. In contrast, the VIX, a measure of market volatility, has generally decreased from 16.97 to 14.06, suggesting that investors are feeling less anxious about the short-term direction of the stock market. The Nikkei 225 has experienced some volatility but ended on a strong note, moving from 20408.54 to 21729.97, which may reflect optimism in the Asian markets or a favorable response to domestic or international economic policies. Gold futures have seen a notable spike, especially between the 11th and 15th market days, where they peaked at 1414.90, potentially indicating a flight to safety or hedge against market uncertainties. Lastly, the strengthening of the EUR/USD exchange rate from 1.12 to 1.14, along with a relatively stable USD/CNY, suggests a weaker dollar or stronger European economic indicators, which could have implications for international trade and currency markets.
