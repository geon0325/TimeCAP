Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 experienced a downward trend, decreasing from 4786.35 to 4356.45, which indicates a bearish sentiment in the market. The VIX, commonly known as the "fear index," has risen from 17.54 to 31.16, suggesting increased market volatility and investor uncertainty. International markets also reflect this cautious stance, with Japan's Nikkei 225 and the UK's FTSE 100 showing declines, ending at 27131.34 and 7371.50, respectively. Commodity prices, however, have seen mixed movements; Gold Futures edged higher, indicating a flight to safety, closing at 1852.70, whereas Crude Oil Futures fluctuated, ending at 85.60 after peaking at 86.96. The currency markets witnessed minor fluctuations in the EUR/USD and USD/CNY exchange rates, maintaining relative stability, while the USD/JPY pair showed a slight depreciation of the dollar against the yen, possibly reflecting a move towards safe-haven currencies.
