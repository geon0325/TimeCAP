Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a modest temperature fluctuation, starting cooler earlier in the day, gradually warming up, and reaching its peak towards the latter part of the day, before slightly cooling off again. Humidity levels varied significantly, with notably high humidity during the early hours, a decrease around midday, and a subsequent increase towards the evening, which could contribute to the feeling of cooler temperatures at night despite the actual readings. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with a minor dip that suggests a transient weather event, possibly affecting wind patterns or precipitation briefly. Wind speeds were mostly moderate but featured a period of high gusts, which could have led to choppy conditions on the bay and affected outdoor activities. Wind direction was variable but predominantly came from the west and north, which is typical for the region and can influence fog patterns along the coast.
