Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual drop in temperature, which later saw a mild recovery, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with a notable peak that could have resulted in a very muggy feeling or the presence of fog, especially common in the San Francisco bay area. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting steady weather conditions without the immediate approach of any significant weather fronts. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a period of calm winds, and the wind direction varied widely throughout the day, which could contribute to changes in local temperature and fog dispersion. The combination of these factors points towards a typical San Francisco weather pattern, with possible morning fog followed by clearer skies as the day progresses.
