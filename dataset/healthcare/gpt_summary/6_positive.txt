Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a significant upward trend in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the ratio of positive specimens increasing from 1.19% in week 1 to a peak of 23.65% in week 17, before declining to 16.23% in the latest week. Influenza A has been the predominant strain, as indicated by the higher ratio of positive specimens for this type compared to Influenza B, reaching its highest at 18.16% in week 17 compared to 5.49% for Influenza B. Despite the recent decline in the overall positivity rate, the percentage of positive specimens for both Influenza A and B remains above the 20-week average of 6.26%, suggesting sustained transmission within the population. The healthcare system may continue to experience increased demand for medical services, diagnostics, and hospitalizations, particularly concerning given the simultaneous circulation of both influenza strains. Public health initiatives focusing on flu vaccinations, personal hygiene, and awareness campaigns could be imperative in managing this ongoing influenza season.
