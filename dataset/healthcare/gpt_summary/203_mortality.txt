Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia relative to total deaths, with a striking peak occurring midway through the period. Specifically, the proportion of deaths attributable to Influenza or Pneumonia surged to more than double the 20-week average, reaching 19.37% and 19.40% in weeks 6 and 7, coinciding with a dramatic rise in total deaths to 86,888 and 87,232 respectively, which suggests a possible outbreak or seasonal spike. However, subsequent weeks have shown a decline in both the absolute number of deaths from these illnesses and their proportion relative to total deaths, indicating a potential easing of the situation. Despite this reduction, the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia has remained above the 20-week average in the latest data, with a ratio of 8.40% in week 20, suggesting persistent challenges for healthcare systems. The initial spike and subsequent high levels of pneumonia and influenza-related deaths could strain healthcare resources and highlight the need for continued surveillance and preventive measures such as vaccination campaigns and public health interventions.
