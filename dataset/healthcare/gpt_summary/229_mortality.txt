Over the past 20 weeks, the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia to the total number of deaths has shown a significant upward trend, starting below the 20-week average of 7.84% and reaching a peak of 16.83% in week 14 before declining. The total number of deaths fluctuated, with a notable increase from week 8 onwards, reaching a peak at week 14 and then experiencing a decrease. Notably, deaths from pneumonia accounted for the majority of the Influenza or Pneumonia category, with week 14 also marking the highest number of pneumonia deaths at 12,316. The total number of deaths attributed to influenza remained relatively low throughout the period, with a slight increase in weeks 13 through 18. The recent decline in the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia in the last two weeks to 8.10% and 8.43%, respectively, suggests a potential easing of the burden on the healthcare system, but it still warrants close monitoring given the previous sharp rise.
