Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight variation mid-period, suggesting stable weather conditions without the immediate presence of a strong weather front. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a noticeable increase towards the end of the period, which could contribute to a change in weather patterns or temperature distribution.
