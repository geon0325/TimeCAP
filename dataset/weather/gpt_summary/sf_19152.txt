Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperature has experienced slight fluctuations within a narrow range, indicating relatively stable conditions without any significant warm or cold trends. Humidity levels have been high, persistently remaining in the 90th percentile, which could lead to a feeling of dampness and may contribute to foggy conditions typical for this coastal city. Air pressure has been notably stable with only minor variations, suggesting a period of settled weather without immediate indications of significant frontal activity or storm development. Wind speeds have been consistently low, indicating a calm wind pattern which is likely to have contributed to the maintenance of the high humidity and stable temperatures by reducing the potential for air mass mixing and dispersion. Wind direction has varied slightly but remained predominantly from the northeast, which is typical for San Francisco's weather pattern, possibly bringing cooler air from the ocean and influencing the microclimate of the area.
