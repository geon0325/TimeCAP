Over the last 20 weeks, the total number of respiratory specimens tested for influenza showed an increasing trend, starting from 25,258 in week 1 and peaking at 49,913 in week 20. Despite fluctuations, the percentage of specimens testing positive for Influenza A and B combined remained below the overall average of 6.26%, with a slight increase in the later weeks, peaking at 0.16% in week 18. The ratio of positive tests for Influenza A has been consistently lower than those for Influenza B, with Influenza B showing a more significant increase in the latter weeks, reaching a high of 0.08% in week 20 as compared to Influenza A's 0.05%. The highest positivity rate for Influenza A was 0.08% in week 18, whereas for Influenza B, it was 0.08% in week 20. These trends indicate a slight increase in influenza activity towards the end of the 20-week period, which could signal a need for increased vigilance and potential resource allocation within the healthcare system for influenza management.
