Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has exhibited a typical diurnal pattern, with a peak during the daytime and a gradual decrease towards the night, before rising again the next day. Humidity levels have fluctuated significantly, increasing during the cooler nighttime hours, indicative of a moist atmosphere, and then decreasing as temperatures rose, which is common in areas where evaporation and daytime heating play a role in atmospheric moisture content. Air pressure remained relatively stable with only slight variations, suggesting a period of steady weather without the immediate influence of strong frontal systems. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate throughout the period, with a couple of instances of slightly higher gusts, which could influence the dispersal of humidity and heat. The wind direction varied significantly, indicating shifting weather patterns and the potential for changes in weather conditions due to incoming systems or local effects.
