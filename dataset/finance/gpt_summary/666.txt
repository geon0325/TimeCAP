The VIX, or Volatility Index, has increased from 17.22 to 24.36, which corroborates the observed unease in the equity markets. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have also experienced fluctuations, with the Nikkei posting a significant drop in the last reported day, potentially reflecting broader global market uncertainties. Gold futures have seen a mild uptick from 1805.60 to 1776.00, suggesting a flight to safety as investors seek traditional safe-haven assets. Lastly, the exchange rates for EUR/USD and USD/JPY have remained relatively stable within a narrow range, while USD/CNY saw a slight strengthening of the dollar over the period, which could indicate subtle shifts in currency markets amidst the observed market volatility.
