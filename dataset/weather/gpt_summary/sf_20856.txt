Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a slight upward trend in temperature, indicating a gradual warming. Humidity levels were extremely high throughout the period, often reaching saturation, which suggests the presence of fog or mist, particularly during the cooler early morning hours when temperatures were at their lowest. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable and high, pointing towards settled weather conditions without significant changes or the presence of storm systems. Wind speeds were consistently light, which would have done little to disperse the high humidity and could contribute to a feeling of stillness in the air. The wind directions varied slightly but were predominantly from the west, suggesting marine influences on the city's weather patterns.
