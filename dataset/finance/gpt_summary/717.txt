Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has exhibited moderate volatility with a downward trend, closing lower by approximately 102.96 points, which may indicate growing investor caution. The VIX, often referred to as the "fear index," has increased notably, peaking at 31.12, suggesting heightened market volatility and uncertainty among investors. In international markets, the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 have also shown declines, potentially reflecting global economic concerns, with the FTSE 100 witnessing a substantial drop of 150.70 points. Gold futures experienced a decrease in price, suggesting a reduced demand for safe-haven assets, despite the increased volatility in equity markets. The exchange rates have remained relatively stable, with minor weakening of the USD against the JPY and CNY, while the EUR/USD pair showed marginal fluctuations, maintaining a level around 1.13 in the latter half of the observed period.
