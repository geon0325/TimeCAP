Over the recent 20-week period, there has been a notable upward trend in the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, starting from 8.16% and rising sharply to 14.57%, which is significantly higher than the average ratio of 7.84%. The total number of deaths peaked in the last observed week at 69,810, coinciding with the highest recorded mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia. Despite fluctuations, the number of deaths specifically from Influenza remained relatively stable, indicating that the increase in the mortality ratio is predominantly driven by a substantial rise in deaths from Pneumonia, from 4,954 to 10,163 over the 20 weeks. This trend suggests a worsening situation, possibly due to seasonal factors, a particularly virulent strain of pneumonia, or other healthcare challenges. The sustained increase in pneumonia-related mortality could place additional strain on healthcare resources and may necessitate targeted public health interventions to address the rising impact of respiratory infections.
