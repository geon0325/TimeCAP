Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a gradual decrease in temperature, indicating a trend of cooling, which reached its lowest point during the early morning hours before gradually rising again. Humidity levels have experienced significant fluctuations, with notably high humidity during the night, which could have contributed to early morning fog or dew. Air pressure has been steadily increasing, suggesting a stable and dry weather pattern is likely establishing itself. Wind speeds have generally been moderate but did show signs of decreasing towards the end of the period, and winds have been predominantly northerly, with a slight shift to northeasterly and easterly directions at times. The combination of rising air pressure, decreasing wind speeds, and variable humidity may lead to pleasant weather conditions, but the northerly winds could continue to bring in cooler air, affecting local temperatures.
