Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a gradual increase in the proportion of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases among the total patient count with a significant uptick in recent weeks, crossing the benchmark threshold of 2.9% in the final week. The highest rise in ILI cases is observed within the 0-4 and 5-24 age groups, suggesting an increased transmission rate among younger populations. The latest week shows a sharp rise in ILI percentages, reaching 3.32%, which could indicate the onset of a more severe influenza season. This trend may lead to increased healthcare utilization and could strain healthcare resources if the trajectory continues. Public health agencies may need to consider bolstering influenza prevention measures, including vaccination and public education campaigns, to mitigate further spread and impact on the healthcare system.
