Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a slight upward trend, closing higher by approximately 1.9% from 2737.70 to 2789.65, suggesting a cautious optimism among investors. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, has remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, but overall it indicates a market that is not experiencing extreme levels of fear or uncertainty. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 indices have both experienced gains, with the Nikkei climbing by approximately 4.2% and the FTSE 100 by 0.1%, reflecting growth in Asian markets and relative stability in European markets, respectively. Gold futures have declined by about 2.5% from 1314.20 to 1282.00, which could indicate a shift of investor preference towards riskier assets as gold is typically seen as a safe haven. Exchange rates have seen minor variations, with the EUR/USD and USD/CNY pairs showing relative stability, while the USD/JPY has appreciated by roughly 1.7%, potentially signaling increased investor confidence in the US dollar or changes in Japan's monetary policy or economic outlook.
