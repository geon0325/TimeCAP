Over the last 20 weeks, the data shows a fluctuating trend in the number of specimens testing positive for both Influenza A and B, with the overall percentage of positive specimens peaking at 0.28% in the first week and hitting a low of 0.07% in week 15. Despite the fluctuations, the average positivity rate of 6.26% mentioned does not align with the provided weekly percentages, which suggests that either the average was calculated over a different time frame or there has been a decline in recent weeks. The number of specimens tested reached its highest at 44,971 in week 3 and gradually decreased to 30,176 by week 20, indicating a possible seasonal decline in testing. Influenza B consistently showed higher positivity rates than Influenza A throughout the period, which could influence the focus of public health interventions. Lastly, the sustained low positivity rates below the average in the later weeks could suggest a decreasing trend in influenza activity, which would alleviate some of the burden on the healthcare system if it continues.
