Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a downward trend, declining from 2945.64 to 2752.06, indicating increased market uncertainty or negative market sentiment. The VIX, commonly known as the "fear index," has trended upwards from 12.87 to 18.71, reflecting growing investor anxiety and potential volatility in the markets. International indices like the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have also experienced declines, consistent with the global risk-off sentiment, with the Nikkei 225 dropping from 22258.73 to 20601.19 and the FTSE 100 falling from 7380.60 to 7161.70.

Commodity prices have been mixed, with Gold Futures rising from 1279.20 to 1305.80, which typically indicates a flight to safety as investors seek haven assets, whereas Crude Oil Futures have decreased significantly from 61.94 to 53.50, which may reflect concerns over global economic health and demand. Lastly, currency exchange rates have remained relatively stable for EUR/USD and USD/CNY, but the USD/JPY has shown a slight depreciation of the dollar from 111.50 to 109.36, which could imply a shift towards the yen as a safe-haven currency amidst market instability.
