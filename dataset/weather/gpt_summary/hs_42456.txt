Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature from its peak in the early hours, followed by a slight increase and then a plateau towards the current hour. Humidity levels showed a marked increase during the nighttime and early morning hours, which is typical due to cooler temperatures and a reduction in mixing in the lower atmosphere, but they decreased significantly as temperatures rose during the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting a steady atmospheric condition without the presence of significant weather fronts or systems during this period. Wind speeds varied, with some stronger gusts observed, but overall, the wind remained moderate. The wind direction showed a general southerly component, with a notable shift to more southwesterly and westerly directions at times, which could influence local weather patterns by bringing in air from different regions.
