Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the number of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the total percentage of positive tests ranging from 0.84% to 1.31%, which is below the average positive ratio of 6.26%. The data shows a consistent decrease in the number of specimens tested, dropping from 84,308 in week 1 to 31,387 in week 20. Despite the decreasing trend in specimen testing, the proportion of positive cases for Influenza A has shown an increase in the latter weeks, peaking at 0.88% in week 17, while the Influenza B positivity rate has decreased from a high of 0.78% in week 10 to 0.41% in week 20. The overall positivity rate for both strains combined has remained relatively stable, with minor weekly fluctuations and maintaining around 1% in the last three weeks. These trends suggest a potential shift in the dominant influenza strain and highlight the importance of continued surveillance and resource allocation for influenza testing and vaccination efforts, especially considering the reduced testing numbers which could mask the true prevalence of infection.
