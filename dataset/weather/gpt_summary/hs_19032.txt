Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, indicative of a warming trend that reached its peak in the latter part of the time frame before slightly cooling. Humidity levels showed a decreasing pattern, suggesting that the air has become drier as the day progressed, which is typical following the diurnal heating pattern. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight overall decrease, indicating stable weather conditions but with the possibility of a weak weather system approaching. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate and increased slightly towards the end of the period, which could contribute to a mild wind chill effect during the cooler hours. The wind direction was predominantly from the southeast, which is common for Houston and can bring moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, potentially affecting humidity levels.
