Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the ratio of mortality due to Influenza or Pneumonia when compared to the total number of deaths, with a peak of 10.25% in the first week and a low of 5.20% in week eight. However, this ratio has consistently been below the 20-week average of 7.84%, indicating a relatively lower impact of these respiratory conditions within the overall mortality during this period. Despite the general downward trend in the total number of deaths, the absolute number of deaths attributed to Influenza has increased significantly in the last five weeks, with a rise from 50 to 203 deaths. In contrast, the number of deaths from Pneumonia has shown a moderate increase from the mid-period low of 2714 in week eight to 3539 in the latest week. These trends suggest that while Pneumonia remains a consistent contributor to mortality, there has been a recent surge in Influenza-related deaths that could signal the onset of a more aggressive flu season, warranting increased vigilance and potentially impacting healthcare resource allocation.
