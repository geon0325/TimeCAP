Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature experienced a gradual increase through the day, peaking during the afternoon hours, after which it showed a slight decline moving into the evening. Humidity levels started high in the early hours and saw a significant decrease as the temperature rose, before increasing slightly again towards the end of the period. Air pressure remained relatively stable with only minor fluctuations, though there was a noticeable dip later in the day. Wind speed varied modestly, generally increasing throughout the day with some calm periods, and there was a shift in wind direction from predominantly easterly in the early hours to southerly by the afternoon. The combination of high humidity and rising temperatures could have led to some discomfort for residents, while the drop in air pressure and change in wind direction could suggest the approach of a weather system.
