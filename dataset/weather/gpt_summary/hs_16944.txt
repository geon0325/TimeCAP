Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced relatively stable and elevated temperatures, with a slight warming trend evident in the latter part of the time series, which could lead to more uncomfortable conditions if the trend persists. Humidity levels have been high, suggesting a muggy atmosphere that might have exacerbated the warmth felt during the day, but there was a noticeable decrease in humidity later on, possibly providing some relief. Air pressure has remained consistently high throughout, indicating stable weather conditions without significant changes in weather patterns. Wind speeds have been low, suggesting a calm period with limited air circulation, which might have contributed to the sensation of higher temperatures due to the lack of cooling breezes. Wind direction variability was minimal, with a general tendency towards easterly winds, which is typical for Houston's climate and could be associated with the transport of moist air from the Gulf of Mexico, maintaining the high humidity levels experienced.
