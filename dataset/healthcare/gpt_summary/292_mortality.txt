Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a fluctuating trend in the total number of deaths, starting at 58,563 and peaking at 72,134 in the final week. Notably, there is a significant increase in deaths from influenza or pneumonia, with deaths from influenza alone rising from 15 to 86, and pneumonia from 3,841 to 9,418, indicating a worsening trend. The ratio of mortality from these conditions to total deaths began below the 20-week average of 7.84%, with a low of 6.18%, but saw a sharp increase in the latter half of the period, reaching a high of 14.15% in week 9, and concluding at 13.18%, which is substantially higher than the average. This spike in the ratio suggests either an increase in the severity or spread of these illnesses, or a decrease in other causes of death. The rise in mortality rates due to influenza and pneumonia could signal an emerging healthcare crisis, necessitating an urgent response to prevent further escalation.
