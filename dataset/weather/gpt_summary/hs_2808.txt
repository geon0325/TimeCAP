Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature followed a typical diurnal pattern with a peak during the afternoon hours and a dip overnight, which is consistent with normal daily temperature variation. Relative humidity levels were inversely related to temperature changes, starting higher during the cooler early morning hours and decreasing as temperatures rose, indicating a typical moisture variation in response to heating of the day. Air pressure experienced a slight but notable decrease through the period, suggesting a potential shift in weather patterns, such as the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds remained mostly light but increased towards the end of the period, possibly signaling the onset of a new weather system. Wind direction showed variability but predominantly came from the south-southeast, which is typical for Houston and can bring moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, affecting local weather conditions.
