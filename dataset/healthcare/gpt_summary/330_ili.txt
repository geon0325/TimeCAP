The time-series data over the last 20 weeks shows a progressive increase in the ratio of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) patients, which ultimately surpassed the baseline threshold of ILI prevalence. This increase is reflective of a growing burden on the healthcare system, with the highest ILI patient ratios observed in the latter weeks of the series, indicating a peak in ILI cases. Notably, the younger population, specifically those aged 5-24, displayed the most significant rise in ILI incidence, which may be attributed to high transmission rates in schools and community settings. Although there has been an uptick in ILI cases across all age groups, the oldest demographic (aged 65 or more) maintained the lowest incidence, which could suggest either better preventive measures in this group or possibly less interaction with high-transmission environments. The recent decline in the ratio of ILI patients may indicate a potential leveling off or reduction in ILI activity, but continued surveillance is essential to confirm this trend and to manage healthcare resources effectively.
