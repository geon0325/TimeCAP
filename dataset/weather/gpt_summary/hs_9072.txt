Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have exhibited a typical diurnal pattern with a gradual increase during the daytime, peaking in the late afternoon, before cooling off slightly at night. In contrast, humidity levels saw significant fluctuation, starting high in the early hours, decreasing to its lowest by late afternoon, and then rising again towards the evening, suggesting a cycle of moisture in the air that could influence local comfort levels and precipitation patterns. Air pressure experienced a notable decrease initially, followed by a sharp rise, and then a gradual decline once again, indicating a potential for changing weather patterns or the passage of a weather front. Wind speeds remained mostly light and variable, with a brief period of calm conditions, which could lead to stagnation and potential buildup of local pollutants. The wind direction shifted throughout the day, predominantly coming from the south-southeast, transitioning to a more southerly direction, and then varying more widely, which could affect the transport of moisture and heat, potentially influencing local weather conditions such as cloud cover and precipitation.
