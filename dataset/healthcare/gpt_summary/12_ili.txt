Over the past 20 weeks, the data indicates a declining trend in the number of patients presenting with Influenza-like Illness (ILI) across all age groups. Despite this overall decrease, the proportion of ILI patients among the youngest age group (0-4 years) remains the highest, suggesting a greater vulnerability or exposure within this demographic. The ratio of ILI patients has consistently stayed below the baseline of 2.9%, indicating a relatively mild ILI season thus far. However, healthcare providers should continue to monitor these trends, especially as the ILI ratio has shown minimal fluctuation in the recent weeks, which may suggest a stabilization rather than a continued decrease in ILI cases. This stable trend, coupled with the persistent presence of ILI in the population, underscores the importance of ongoing surveillance and preventive measures, such as vaccination and public health education, particularly for the most affected age groups.
