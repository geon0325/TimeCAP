Over the past 20 weeks, the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia to total deaths has demonstrated significant variability, with an average of 7.84% but showing a marked increase in weeks 13 through 20, peaking at 14.15%. This surge is notably higher than the average and could indicate a seasonal outbreak or an anomaly in disease prevalence or detection. The total number of deaths has increased in the latter weeks, with a high at week 20 of 67820 deaths, which corresponds to a period of increased mortality from pneumonia, as evidenced by the numbers peaking at 9741 in week 13. Influenza deaths remained relatively low and stable, suggesting that pneumonia is the primary driver of the increased ratio seen in the later weeks. This trend may place additional strain on healthcare resources and could necessitate targeted public health interventions to manage the burden of pneumonia.
