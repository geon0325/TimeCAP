Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a noticeable decline in temperature from the day's peak towards the early hours of the morning, followed by a gradual increase as the day progressed. Humidity levels have shown significant fluctuations, with the highest values occurring during the cooler early morning hours, indicating possible early morning fog or mist, and the lowest in the late afternoon, which may have provided clearer conditions. Air pressure experienced a substantial drop during the day, which could suggest the approach of a weather front potentially leading to changes in weather patterns such as increased wind speeds or precipitation. Wind speeds have varied, with some higher gusts earlier in the period calming down significantly towards the latter part, while wind direction has been predominantly westerly, with occasional shifts that could influence local weather conditions, such as bringing in cooler air from the ocean or warmer air from inland. Overall, these variations in weather indicators highlight a dynamic weather situation in San Francisco, with potential for varied conditions including fog, wind changes, and possibly unsettled weather associated with the drop in air pressure.
