Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures experienced a notable diurnal variation, with a peak during the afternoon and a cooling trend towards the early hours of the morning. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, suggesting the passage of different air masses or frontal systems through the area, which could have led to variable cloud cover and potentially changing weather conditions. Air pressure was relatively stable initially but showed some variability, indicating the possible influence of transient weather systems passing through the region. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a few periods of higher gusts, which could have contributed to rapid changes in local weather conditions, such as sudden temperature shifts or dispersal of fog. The wind direction was predominantly westerly, with some variability, consistent with the maritime influence on San Francisco's climate, but the occasional shifts in direction could be associated with local weather disturbances.
