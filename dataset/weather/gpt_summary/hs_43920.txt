Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures experienced a mild fluctuation, with a general trend of cooling overnight and warming during daylight hours, consistent with diurnal patterns. Humidity levels showed an inverse relationship with temperature, peaking during the cooler early morning hours and dropping as temperatures rose, indicative of the typical moisture dynamics in the atmosphere. Air pressure gradually decreased throughout the period, suggesting a potential change in weather patterns or the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds remained relatively light with minimal variability, but there was a noticeable shift in wind direction, which oscillated between northerly and easterly directions possibly influencing local weather conditions. The combination of the observed decrease in air pressure, the shift in wind direction, and the fluctuations in temperature and humidity could be indicative of an evolving weather situation that may warrant closer monitoring for any significant changes that could affect the region.
