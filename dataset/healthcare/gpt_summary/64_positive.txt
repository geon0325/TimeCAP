Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in influenza activity, with the ratio of positive specimens reaching a peak of 24.73% in week 9 and subsequently decreasing to 5.33% by week 20. Influenza A has been the predominant strain throughout the period, with its ratio of positive specimens peaking at 20.21% in week 7 and then declining to 1.52% by the end of the observed timeframe. In contrast, Influenza B showed a later peak at 11.26% in week 14, but it also followed a downward trend to 3.82% by week 20. The overall average positivity ratio of 6.26% suggests that the current week's value of 5.33% is below average, indicating a potential downtrend in influenza cases. Healthcare providers should be aware of these trends to optimize resource allocation, prepare for potential future surges, and inform public health strategies for vaccination and prevention.
