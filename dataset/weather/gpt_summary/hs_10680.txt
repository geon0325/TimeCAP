Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have remained relatively stable with a slight fluctuation, experiencing a notable drop toward the end of the observed period. Humidity levels have seen some variability, alternating between moderate to high percentages, which could contribute to a muggy feeling in the air. Air pressure has been gradually decreasing, which is often indicative of an approaching weather system that could bring precipitation or storms. Wind speeds have been mostly light to moderate with occasional calm periods, and there has been no dominant wind direction, suggesting variable wind patterns. The combination of dropping temperatures, high humidity, decreasing air pressure, and variable winds could signal the potential for changing weather conditions, possibly leading to rain or thunderstorms in the near future.
