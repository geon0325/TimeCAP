Over the past day, San Francisco experienced a notable decrease in temperature from peak values in the early hours to a more moderate range by the end, suggesting a significant diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels showed dramatic fluctuations, with a peak that coincided with a spike in air pressure, possibly indicating the passage of a weather front or the development of fog typical for the area. Air pressure remained fairly stable throughout the period, with only minor variations, which is generally associated with steady weather conditions. Wind speeds varied, with periods of calm interspersed with moderate breezes, while wind direction was predominantly westerly, a common pattern for the region, except for a temporary shift to more variable directions. The combination of these factors suggests a dynamic weather pattern with changing local conditions that could affect outdoor activities and general comfort levels in San Francisco.
