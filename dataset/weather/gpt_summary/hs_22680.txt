Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have demonstrated a slight fluctuation within a moderate range, indicating a relatively stable thermal environment. Humidity levels saw a peak during the nighttime hours, which is typical due to the decrease in temperature and can lead to morning fog or dew. Atmospheric pressure has experienced a gradual decrease, suggesting a possible change in weather patterns that could lead to unsettled weather or the approach of a frontal system. Wind speeds have been mild to moderate, with a slight increase observed later in the period, potentially contributing to a dispersion of humidity and any cloud cover. The wind direction has been predominantly from the southeast, which is consistent with the region's prevailing winds and may bring in moisture from the Gulf, possibly affecting local weather conditions with increased cloudiness or chances of precipitation.
