Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant increase in the proportion of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the overall positivity ratio climbing from 1.81% to 14.25%, suggesting a substantial seasonal outbreak. Influenza A has consistently been the dominant strain, although its proportion of positive specimens has seen a relative decline from 11.76% in week 14 to 7.55% in week 20, indicating a possible tapering of this strain. Conversely, Influenza B has shown an upward trend in the same period, with its positivity ratio almost doubling from 3.52% to 6.70%, which could signal a shift in the prevalent strain and warrants close monitoring. The peak of influenza activity appears to have occurred around weeks 9 and 10, with the highest recorded positivity ratios of 18.27% and 14.99% for Influenza A and B, respectively. This trend of increasing influenza activity could strain healthcare resources, necessitating preparedness in medical facilities, adequate vaccine supply, and public health interventions to mitigate the spread.
