Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced relatively stable temperature conditions with a slight fluctuation that is typical for coastal areas. Humidity levels remained high throughout the day, suggesting a persistent presence of moisture in the air that could lead to foggy conditions, especially during the early hours. Air pressure has been consistently high, indicating stable weather conditions without significant changes or the development of storm systems. Wind speeds were notably light and steady, which would not contribute to significant wind chill effects or dispersion of fog and humidity. The wind direction varied mostly from the southwest to the west, which is common for the region and can influence the movement of marine air inland, potentially affecting coastal and bay temperatures.
