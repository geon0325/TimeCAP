Over the last 20 weeks, the incidence of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) across all age groups has shown a consistent decline, with the ratio of ILI patients falling below the baseline set for influenza outbreaks. This trend is observed across every age category, which indicates a widespread reduction in ILI cases. The youngest age group (0-4 years) remains the highest contributor to ILI statistics, but even in this demographic, there is a notable decrease in cases. As the ratio of ILI patients has been below the baseline for several weeks, the pressure on healthcare systems due to ILI may have lessened, potentially allowing for the reallocation of resources to other areas of need. However, vigilance is necessary as even with the decline, ILI remains present in the population, and any uptick could signal the need for renewed healthcare attention.
