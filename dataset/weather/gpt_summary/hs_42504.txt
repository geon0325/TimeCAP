Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before stabilizing. Concurrently, humidity levels showed a significant decrease towards the evening, indicating drier conditions as the day progressed. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with only minor fluctuations, which suggests a stable weather pattern without significant fronts or storms. Wind speeds were generally light to gentle and exhibited some variability in direction, with notable shifts from northeasterly to southeasterly and later to more westerly and northwesterly directions, suggesting the passage of a weather system. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, stable pressure, and variable winds points to fair weather conditions with possible clear skies, but the variability in wind direction could signal changes on the horizon.
