Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature, with a general upward trend peaking during the late afternoon before gradually decreasing toward the evening. Humidity levels have shown a significant inverse correlation with temperature, starting higher in the cooler early hours and decreasing as temperatures rose. Air pressure remained relatively stable with only minor variations throughout the day, suggesting a period of steady weather conditions. Wind speeds were consistently light to moderate, with no significant gusts, while the wind direction shifted from easterly in the early hours to predominantly southerly, and then veered westerly before settling in a southerly direction again. These conditions, combined with the low wind speeds and stable pressure, would likely contribute to a warm and relatively clear day with no immediate signs of severe weather disruptions.
