Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has experienced volatility with an early dip, a recovery mid-period, and a closing slightly higher than it started. The VIX, which measures market volatility, has mirrored this with higher values in the earlier days, a dip to lower levels during the mid-period recovery of the S&P 500, and a slight uptick towards the end, indicating increased market uncertainty. The Nikkei 225 showed relative stability with a modest upward trend, while the FTSE 100 consistently grew, suggesting more resilience in these markets. Gold futures saw a significant increase in value, signaling a potential shift by investors towards safe-haven assets amidst market uncertainties. Exchange rates indicate a weakening US dollar against the Euro and Japanese Yen while slightly strengthening against the Chinese Yuan, which could affect multinational trade dynamics and currency markets.
