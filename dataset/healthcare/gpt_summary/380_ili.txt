Over the last 20 weeks, the proportion of ILI cases among the total patient count has remained below the benchmark level of 2.9%, with a peak ILI ratio of 2.67% observed in week six. The age group 0-4 consistently presented the highest numbers of ILI cases, reaching a maximum of 15,809 cases in week seven. The ILI incidence in all age groups has shown a decreasing trend from the initial weeks, with the latest week's data indicating a ratio of 1.90%, which is a slight increase from the preceding two weeks. Notably, the total patient count has been relatively stable, with minor fluctuations, suggesting that the observed trends in ILI cases are not due to changes in overall healthcare utilization. Despite ILI ratios being below the threshold, continuous monitoring is crucial as even minor increases, especially in vulnerable age groups like 0-4, could signal a need for preemptive healthcare measures to manage potential outbreaks.
