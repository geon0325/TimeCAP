Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a slight decrease in temperature, followed by a gradual warming trend that peaked during the latter part of the observed period. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with very high humidity observed at certain times, potentially indicating the presence of fog or mist, especially during the nighttime and early morning hours. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase towards the end of the period, suggesting stable weather conditions might continue. Wind speeds were generally low, with occasional moderate gusts, and wind direction varied, indicating a lack of a dominant weather front. The combination of high humidity levels at times and low wind speeds could result in reduced visibility and a damp feeling in the air, which may persist if these conditions continue.
