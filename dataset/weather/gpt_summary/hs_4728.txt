Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a gradual rise in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before beginning a slow decline as the evening progressed. Humidity levels started high during the early morning hours and saw a significant dip midday, but they rose again slightly in the evening, indicating the potential for a muggy night ahead. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a minor fluctuation, suggesting steady weather conditions without the immediate likelihood of significant weather events such as storms. Wind speeds varied moderately throughout the day, with a noticeable increase towards the end of the period, which could result in cooler perceived temperatures and the potential for wind-related advisories. The wind direction was predominantly from the southeast, with some variation, which is typical for coastal cities like Houston, possibly contributing to the higher humidity levels experienced.
