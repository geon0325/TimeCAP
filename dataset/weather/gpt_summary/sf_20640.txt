Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have remained relatively stable with only slight fluctuations, indicating a generally consistent weather pattern without significant warming or cooling trends. Humidity levels have been high, persistently staying in the 90s percentile range, which could result in a feeling of mugginess and may contribute to foggy conditions typical of the local climate. Air pressure has shown a gradual increasing trend, suggesting the strengthening of a high-pressure system, which is often associated with stable and dry weather conditions. Wind speeds have decreased over time, starting moderately and tapering off, which could lead to reduced dispersion of any airborne particles and potentially affect air quality. The wind direction has gradually shifted from southerly to more westerly, which may influence coastal weather patterns and could bring in marine air, affecting local temperatures and conditions.
