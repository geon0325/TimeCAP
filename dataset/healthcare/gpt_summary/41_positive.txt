Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable upward trend in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for both Influenza A and B, with the combined positivity rate increasing from 0.85% to 3.32%, surpassing the 20-week average of 6.26%. Influenza A showed a more pronounced increase in positivity rate, rising from 0.41% to 2.47%, indicating a potential dominance or higher transmission rate. The number of specimens tested has also risen significantly, from 5,888 in week 1 to 21,542 in week 20, reflecting an increased testing demand that could strain laboratory resources. While Influenza B's positivity rate also increased, it did so at a slower rate, from 0.44% to 0.85%, suggesting that Influenza A may be the more pressing concern. The consistent increase in positivity rates for both strains highlights the need for enhanced surveillance, vaccination efforts, and preparedness in healthcare settings to manage a potential influx of influenza cases.
