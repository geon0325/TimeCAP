Air pressure saw a general increase midday, suggesting a potential stabilization of weather patterns but later showed a slight decrease, which could lead to changing weather conditions. Wind speeds were moderate to low and quite variable, with some calmer periods, which may have contributed to a feeling of higher temperatures due to less wind chill.
