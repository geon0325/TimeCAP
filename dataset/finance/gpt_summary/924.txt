Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with a general downward trend, dropping from 3966.85 to 3640.47, indicating increased investor caution and a potentially bearish outlook. The VIX, commonly known as the fear gauge, has correspondingly risen from 25.56 to 31.84, suggesting that market volatility and investor uncertainty have increased. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have also experienced declines, with the Nikkei dropping from 27661.47 to 26422.05 and the FTSE 100 falling from 7148.50 to 6881.60, reflecting global market pressures. Gold Futures have not seen a consistent safe-haven demand, with prices fluctuating and ending slightly lower at 1658.50, down from 1696.60, while Crude Oil Futures have decreased from 86.61 to 81.23, perhaps due to concerns over global economic growth. Exchange rates have seen the USD strengthening against major currencies, with the EUR/USD pair moving from parity to 0.97 and the USD/CNY pair rising from 6.89 to 7.20, which could impact international trade dynamics and currency markets.
