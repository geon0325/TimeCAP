Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have experienced a slight fluctuation with a general cooling trend overnight and a gradual increase into the afternoon, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels have been notably high, reaching saturation during the nighttime and early morning hours, which could have led to foggy conditions, particularly evident with the 100% humidity readings. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, suggesting a period of settled weather without significant frontal activity. Wind speeds were light and showed a slight increase towards the end of the 24-hour period, while the wind direction shifted gradually from a primarily westerly to a more southwesterly direction, which may influence coastal conditions and temperature patterns. The combination of high humidity, stable pressure, and light winds could result in cool and foggy mornings followed by clearer and slightly warmer afternoons.
