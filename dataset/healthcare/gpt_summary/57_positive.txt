Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant increase in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with an overall average positivity ratio of 6.26%. The data indicates a rising trend in influenza activity, with the percentage of positive specimens for both Influenza A and B increasing, culminating in a peak positivity rate of 24.73% in week 16 before a slight decline. Notably, Influenza A has been the predominant strain for the majority of the period, reaching a high of 20.21% positivity in week 14, but Influenza B has shown a recent surge, surpassing Influenza A in week 20 with a positivity rate of 10.56% compared to 9.15% for Influenza A. This shift in dominance from Influenza A to B and an overall high rate of influenza positivity suggest a significant impact on healthcare resources, necessitating increased vigilance, preparedness for higher patient volumes, and possibly influencing vaccine formulation for the following season. The trend implies a need for ongoing public health messaging and influenza prevention strategies, including vaccination and antiviral treatment, especially as the data reflects a sustained transmission of influenza within the community.
