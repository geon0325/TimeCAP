Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual increase in temperature reaching a peak in the latter part of the day, indicative of typical diurnal variation with cooler temperatures in the early hours. Humidity levels have fluctuated significantly, with notably low values during the middle of the day, suggesting the possibility of drier conditions that may have felt more comfortable or led to increased evaporation rates. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day but showed a significant drop towards the end, which could be indicative of an approaching weather system that may alter current conditions. Wind speeds were moderate and displayed some variability, with occasional gusts that might have influenced wave conditions along the coast and wind chill factors. The wind direction was predominantly westerly, with a tendency to shift towards northerly and northeasterly directions, which is typical for the region and may have contributed to the transport of cooler oceanic air inland.
