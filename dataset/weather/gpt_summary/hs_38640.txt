Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has exhibited a slight upward trend, indicating a warming pattern that peaked during the late afternoon hours before gradually cooling down. Humidity levels were significantly high throughout, with a period of complete saturation in the morning, which could have led to foggy conditions or precipitations. Air pressure remained relatively stable, though a slight decline was observed towards the current hour, suggesting the possibility of changing weather conditions such as increased cloudiness or a chance of rain. Wind speeds were mostly gentle to moderate but increased later in the day, indicating more active weather that could contribute to the dispersal of humidity or the movement of weather systems. The wind direction was primarily from the south to southeast, which is typical for Houston and may have contributed to the warm and humid conditions experienced.
