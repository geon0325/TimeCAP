Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before stabilizing slightly below the maximum towards the evening. Humidity levels witnessed significant fluctuations, with higher levels during the night and early morning hours, indicative of possible morning fog or dew, and lower levels during the day, which could have contributed to comfortable weather conditions despite the warmer temperatures. Air pressure varied notably, with a sharp drop observed twice, which may suggest the passage of a weather front, potentially leading to changes in weather conditions such as increased cloudiness or a chance of precipitation. Wind speeds were mostly moderate but showed some variability, with occasional gusts that could affect outdoor activities and maritime conditions. The wind direction shifted throughout the day, predominantly from the west with intermittent shifts to the north, which is typical for coastal San Francisco and could influence coastal fog dispersion and temperature variation.
