Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced relatively stable temperatures with minor fluctuations, maintaining a moderately warm range typical for the region. Humidity levels have remained high and consistent, reaching saturation at times, which could contribute to a feeling of mugginess and the potential for fog or dew formation. Air pressure has shown a slight but steady decline, suggesting a possibly weakening high-pressure system that could lead to changing weather patterns or increased chances of precipitation in the near term. Wind speeds have been mostly light with some variability, and the wind direction has shifted significantly, starting from the southeast and gradually turning to a northerly direction, indicating a change in the weather system affecting the area. The combination of high humidity, decreasing air pressure, and changing wind patterns could signal an incoming frontal system, with the possibility of cooler temperatures and rain in the forecast for Houston.
