Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable decrease in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the overall ratio dropping from 18.49% to 0.92%. This trend indicates a declining prevalence of influenza within the tested population. Influenza A has shown a consistent decrease in its contribution to positive specimens, now accounting for just 0.73% compared to 9.08% at the beginning of the period. Conversely, Influenza B has experienced a more significant decline, with its ratio falling from 9.40% to a mere 0.19%. Considering these trends, the healthcare system may anticipate a reduction in influenza cases requiring medical attention, allowing resources to be allocated to other pressing health concerns.
