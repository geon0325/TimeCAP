Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable decline in the number of deaths from influenza and pneumonia relative to the total number of deaths, with a peak mortality ratio of 15.78% in week 3 decreasing to 10.72% by week 20. Despite the total number of deaths fluctuating, with a peak at week 3 (78946 deaths), the absolute number of deaths attributed to influenza and pneumonia has consistently decreased, suggesting a seasonal decline or effective public health interventions. However, the mortality ratio from these causes has experienced a slight increase in the last five weeks, rising from a low of 7.33% in week 14 to 10.72% in week 20, which could indicate a resurgence that needs to be monitored. This increase is predominantly due to a rise in pneumonia-related deaths, as influenza deaths have remained low and relatively stable in the latter weeks. Healthcare systems should remain vigilant for potential increases in these respiratory illnesses and continue to implement preventative measures, especially as the ratio of mortality from these causes is still above the average of 7.84%.
