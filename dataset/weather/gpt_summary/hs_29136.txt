Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature from the early morning hours, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before slowly declining toward the evening. Humidity levels showed a significant drop during the day, starting high during the night and early morning, then sharply decreasing as temperatures rose, indicating the likelihood of drier conditions as the day progressed. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day with a slight downward trend, suggesting a stable weather pattern with no significant changes expected in the short term. Wind speeds picked up in the afternoon, gaining strength towards the evening, which could influence wind chill factors and possibly lead to cooler perceived temperatures. Lastly, the wind direction was predominantly from the south to the southwest for the majority of the day, which is typical for Houston and can contribute to the transportation of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico into the area.
