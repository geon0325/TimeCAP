Over the last 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have experienced slight fluctuations, with a general trend of cooling during the night followed by a warming pattern during the daytime. Humidity levels have shown a slight decreasing trend towards the later hours after remaining relatively high throughout the day, indicating less moisture in the air as the day progressed. Atmospheric pressure remained remarkably stable, suggesting a period of steady weather without the immediate influence of significant frontal systems. Wind speeds were consistently light, with no significant gusts or variations, which implies a calm wind pattern. However, there was a notable shift in wind direction towards the later hours, transitioning from northerly to southerly and then to westerly directions, which could influence coastal weather conditions and potentially bring changes in temperature or moisture levels from the ocean.
