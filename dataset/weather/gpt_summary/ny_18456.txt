Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak during the late afternoon before tapering off slightly. Humidity levels have seen considerable fluctuations, starting moderate, spiking significantly overnight which could have led to a feeling of mugginess, then dropping sharply during the day, indicative of drier conditions. Air pressure remained fairly stable with a slight increase throughout the period, suggesting stable weather conditions are likely to continue. Wind speeds have been predominantly light with a slight increase towards the current hour, and wind direction has shifted from primarily westerly to a more southerly direction by the end of the period, which may affect the transport of air masses into the region. The combination of rising temperatures, variable humidity, and steady pressure accompanied by light winds generally point to calm weather, but the shift in wind direction could bring changes in the short-term weather pattern.
