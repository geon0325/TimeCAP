Over the last 24 hours in New York City, the weather has shown a slight upward trend in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before gradually cooling down. Humidity levels experienced significant fluctuations; starting at moderate levels in the early hours, they increased to very high levels towards the morning, subsequently decreased sharply during the afternoon, and then rose again by the end of the period. Air pressure has been slowly but steadily decreasing throughout the day, which could be indicative of an approaching weather system that may lead to changes in weather patterns. Wind speeds were consistent and moderate in the early part of the day but reduced to light breezes as the day progressed. The wind direction was predominantly from the south to south-west in the early hours and then shifted to west and north-west before veering to a more south-westerly direction by the end of the period, which could influence the movement of weather systems across the area.
