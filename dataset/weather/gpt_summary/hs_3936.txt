Over the last 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have exhibited a typical diurnal pattern, with the lowest values recorded just before dawn and the highest in the late afternoon, indicative of clear skies or light cloud cover. Humidity levels have shown significant fluctuation, with a notable increase during the early morning hours, likely due to nighttime cooling leading to condensation, and a decrease during the afternoon as temperatures rose. Air pressure has remained relatively stable, with a slight increase at times, suggesting steady weather conditions without the immediate influence of a significant weather system. Wind speeds were generally light but increased towards the end of the period, which could indicate the approach of a weather front or system. Wind directions have varied, with some periods of calm winds, but have predominantly come from the south to the southeast, typical for Houston's climate, possibly bringing in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico.
