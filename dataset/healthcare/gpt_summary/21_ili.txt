Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a consistent trend below the baseline threshold for Influenza-like Illness (ILI), suggesting that ILI incidence has remained relatively low. Despite this general trend, there has been a gradual increase in the ratio of ILI patients, which could signal a potential rise in ILI activity moving forward. All age groups have seen an uptick in ILI cases, with the youngest and school-age populations (0-4 and 5-24 years) experiencing the most noticeable increase. While the current rates are below what would be considered an epidemic threshold, the steady growth in ILI cases across all age demographics requires ongoing monitoring as it could strain healthcare resources if the trend continues. The upward trajectory in ILI patient ratios, especially if it persists or accelerates, may necessitate preemptive public health measures to manage the potential increase in healthcare demands.
