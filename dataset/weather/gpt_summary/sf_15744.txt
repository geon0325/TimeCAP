Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, reaching its lowest point in the early morning hours, before warming up again later in the day. Relative humidity levels were variable, with a notable increase during the night that coincided with the drop in temperature, possibly leading to morning fog which is typical for the area. Air pressure remained stable throughout the period, indicating a period of relatively settled weather. Wind speeds varied, with several gustier periods, particularly in the early hours, and the wind direction shifted throughout the day, with a notable change from westerly to northerly and then to a more southerly direction by the end of the period. These conditions are consistent with the region's coastal climate, where temperature, humidity, and wind patterns are influenced by the proximity to the Pacific Ocean.
