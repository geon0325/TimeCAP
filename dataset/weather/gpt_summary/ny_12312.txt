Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, transitioning from cold to colder conditions. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with a noticeable increase midway through the period, suggesting the possibility of more moisture in the air which may have been felt as dampness or resulted in some frost given the low temperatures. Air pressure showed a slight but steady decline, which could be indicative of an approaching weather system that may bring changes in the near future. Wind speeds varied, with a period of calm followed by a sharp increase towards the end of the observation period, indicating that gustier conditions have set in. The wind direction was predominantly from the north and shifted to westerly directions later on, which may have contributed to the falling temperatures as colder air masses moved in from those directions.
