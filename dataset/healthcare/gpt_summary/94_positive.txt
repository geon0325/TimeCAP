Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable upward trend in the ratio of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with an increase from 1.81% to 10.75%. The number of specimens tested has also risen substantially, from 6,755 to 30,767, possibly reflecting heightened surveillance during a period of increasing influenza activity. Influenza A has been the predominant strain, with its positivity ratio escalating more sharply from 1.07% to 8.06% compared to Influenza B's increase from 0.74% to 2.69%. The peak in positive specimens occurred in the most recent week, indicating a potential surge in influenza cases that could strain healthcare resources. This trend suggests the need for enhanced influenza prevention measures, such as vaccination and public health messaging, and preparedness for increased hospital and outpatient care demands.
