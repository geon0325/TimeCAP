Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia relative to total deaths has fluctuated, with a minimum observed ratio of 5.19% and a peak of 6.09%, both of which are below the average ratio of 7.84%. The total number of deaths has remained relatively stable, with a slight increase observed towards the end of the period. Despite this stability in total deaths, the number of deaths from pneumonia has shown a slight upward trend, culminating in 3,412 deaths in the penultimate week, which is the highest weekly count within the period. In contrast, deaths from influenza have remained relatively low and consistent, with no significant spikes. These trends suggest that while influenza is currently less of a burden, pneumonia continues to be a significant contributor to mortality and could be indicative of either seasonal patterns or emerging healthcare challenges requiring monitoring and potential intervention.
