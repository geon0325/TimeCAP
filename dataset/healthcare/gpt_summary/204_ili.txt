Over the last 20 weeks, the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) activity has shown a noticeable fluctuation, with a peak in the reported ratio of ILI patients that significantly exceeded the baseline threshold. The highest ILI activity was observed in the age group of 5-24 years, which could be indicative of higher transmission rates in schools or among younger populations. Following the peak, there has been a downward trend across all age groups, with the most recent weeks showing ILI ratios falling below the baseline, suggesting a decline in influenza activity. However, the sustained period above the baseline threshold highlights the importance of continued surveillance, vaccination, and public health interventions to manage ILI, especially in the most affected age groups. The observed trends could have implications for healthcare resource allocation, signaling periods of heightened demand for medical care and potential strain on healthcare services during peak ILI activity.
