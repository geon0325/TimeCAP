Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a notable fluctuation in temperature with a general increase during the day and a cooling trend overnight. Humidity levels have been relatively high, peaking at certain hours, which could contribute to a muggy feeling and may have implications for local weather phenomena such as fog or dew. Air pressure has shown a slight decreasing trend, which could indicate the approach of a weather system that might bring changes in weather patterns, including the possibility of precipitation or storms. Wind speeds have been mostly light to moderate but increased later in the day, potentially influencing the dispersal of any local air pollution and affecting wind chill factors. Wind direction has remained predominantly from the south to southeast, suggesting a consistent weather pattern and possibly the influence of regional weather systems.
