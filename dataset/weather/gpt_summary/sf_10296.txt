Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, with the warmth peaking in the late afternoon hours. The humidity levels fluctuated significantly, dropping markedly in the evening, which could have led to a sense of dryness in the air and potentially contributed to greater comfort levels or exacerbated dry conditions. The air pressure remained relatively stable, with only minor fluctuations, indicating a period of steady weather without the presence of significant frontal systems. Wind speeds were predominantly light, with occasional calm periods, suggesting a tranquil wind regime that would not have contributed to any substantial wind chill factor or dispersion of urban pollutants. Wind direction varied, with a notable shift from primarily westerly to a mix of northerly and easterly directions, which may have influenced local temperature distribution and air quality in the city.
