Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature, with a general trend of cooling during the earlier hours followed by a warming trend towards the latter part of the period. Humidity levels remained relatively high throughout, suggesting a moist air mass over the city, which could have led to a feeling of mugginess or the potential for fog, especially during the early morning or late evening hours. Air pressure remained fairly stable, with a notable increase in the middle of the period, which typically indicates a transient high-pressure system that could bring clearer skies. Wind speeds were consistently light, suggesting calm weather conditions without significant wind-related impacts. Lastly, wind direction varied, with occasional shifts, which could have influenced localized temperature and fog distribution due to changes in marine air influence.
