Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, followed by a slight increase, indicative of a typical diurnal pattern. Humidity levels have shown a general decrease throughout the period, which, when combined with the steady rise in air pressure, suggests the arrival of a drier air mass and potentially more stable weather conditions. Wind speed has remained fairly constant with only a slight decrease towards the end of the period, indicating relatively steady atmospheric conditions. The wind direction has been predominantly from the southwest to the north, shifting more northerly later in the period, which may be associated with the incoming drier air and high-pressure system. Overall, these indicators point towards a period of fair weather with a likelihood of clear skies and lower humidity levels in the immediate future for Houston.
