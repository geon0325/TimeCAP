Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature exhibited a typical diurnal pattern, with a gradual increase during the day, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before cooling down towards the evening. Relative humidity showed an inverse relationship with temperature, as commonly expected, with higher humidity levels during the cooler early morning hours and a sharp decrease as temperatures peaked, indicating potential discomfort during the hotter part of the day. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight decreasing trend, suggesting stable weather conditions but possibly indicating an approaching weather system. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate but showed an increase towards the evening, which could contribute to a perceived decrease in temperature due to wind chill. The prevailing wind direction was predominantly from the south to southeast, which in Houston is typically associated with warmer and more humid air masses moving inland from the Gulf of Mexico.
