Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a fluctuation in the mortality percentage from Influenza or Pneumonia relative to total deaths, with the peak observed in week 11 (10.69%) and a notable decline to the lowest point in the final week (5.20%). Despite this decline, the overall average mortality ratio for the period (8.56%) remains slightly above the historical average of 7.84%, suggesting a heightened impact of these diseases on overall mortality during this timeframe. The total number of deaths has shown a slight decreasing trend towards the end of the 20-week period, with week 20 marking the lowest total deaths (52536), which corresponds to the sharp drop in pneumonia deaths for that week (2714). The number of deaths specifically from influenza has remained relatively low and stable, with a slight increase in the last week (17), which could be an early indicator of a potential rise in influenza mortality. These trends are critical for healthcare planning and resource allocation, particularly in anticipating potential surges in respiratory illnesses and ensuring adequate healthcare system preparedness.
