Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has experienced significant volatility, with a sharp drop from 3370.29 to 2386.13, reflecting increased market uncertainty and potential bearish sentiment. The VIX, which measures market volatility, has risen dramatically from 14.83 to 82.69, indicating a surge in investor fear and market instability. Global equity markets have also seen downturns, as evidenced by the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 indices, which have both declined, with the Nikkei dropping from 23193.80 to 17002.04 and the FTSE 100 from 7382.00 to 5151.10, suggesting widespread concern about economic growth and corporate earnings. Safe-haven assets such as gold have fluctuated, peaking at 1674.50 before retreating to 1485.90, while crude oil futures have plummeted from 52.05 to 28.70, reflecting both demand shocks and price wars in the oil market. Amidst this turmoil, the exchange rates have seen less dramatic shifts, with the EUR/USD pair and USD/JPY pair showing moderate fluctuations, but the USD/CNY pair has remained relatively stable, suggesting that currency markets are less affected than equity and commodity markets in the short term.
