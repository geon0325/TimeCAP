Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a slight upward trend, increasing from 4200.88 to 4266.49, suggesting a modestly positive sentiment among investors. The VIX, commonly known as the fear index, has decreased from 16.74 to 15.97, indicating reduced market volatility and increased investor confidence. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 indices have also experienced slight climbs, reflective of a general uptick in global equities. Gold Futures have seen a decline from 1895.70 to 1775.60, which may indicate a shift away from safe-haven assets amidst a more risk-on market environment. Currency markets show the USD strengthening against major currencies, with the EUR/USD and USD/JPY moving from 1.22 to 1.19 and 109.17 to 111.01 respectively, which could point to changing international trade dynamics and potential impacts on multinational earnings.
