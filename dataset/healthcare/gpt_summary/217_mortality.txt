Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a general decline in the percentage of deaths attributed to influenza or pneumonia compared to total deaths, starting from a high of 9.36% and ending at 7.27%, with a notable trough to 5.91% in week 16. Despite the overall downward trend, the last four weeks have shown a slight increase in the mortality ratio, with week 20 marking a rise to 7.27% from a low of 5.91% in week 16. The total number of deaths fluctuated with no clear trend, ranging from 57,001 to 61,752, while deaths from pneumonia showed a gradual decrease, with occasional upticks, from 5,769 in week 1 to 4,229 in week 20. Influenza-related deaths remained low throughout the period, varying between 3 and 17 weekly deaths, and did not significantly impact the overall trend in mortality ratio. This pattern suggests a potential seasonal decline in pneumonia but warrants close monitoring for the recent uptick in mortality ratio to inform healthcare resource allocation and preventative health measures.
