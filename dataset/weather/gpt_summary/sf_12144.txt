Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the latest hours. Humidity levels showed a significant decrease towards the end of the period, possibly indicating the movement of a drier air mass into the area. Air pressure remained relatively stable with only minor fluctuations, which suggests a period of stable weather conditions. Wind speeds decreased significantly to calm conditions, with an eventual cessation of wind, indicating a potential buildup of fog or haze, especially given the city's coastal location. The wind direction was variable throughout the day, but a notable shift occurred from predominantly westerly to northerly and easterly directions, which may affect local temperature and fog patterns.
