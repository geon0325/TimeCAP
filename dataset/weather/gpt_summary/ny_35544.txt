Over the last 24 hours in New York City, there has been a gradual decline in temperature, transitioning from mild to cooler conditions. Humidity levels have consistently remained at saturation, indicating a high likelihood of fog or precipitation during this period. Air pressure experienced a slight dip before steadily increasing, suggesting a possible change in weather patterns such as the arrival of a high-pressure system that could lead to clearing skies. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate but have shown a gradual increase, which could contribute to wind chill, making the cooler temperatures feel even colder. The wind direction shifted from a southerly to a westerly and finally a northwesterly direction, which is often associated with the movement of weather systems and cooler air masses into the region.
