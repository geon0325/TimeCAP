Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have shown a gradual increase, peaking during the late afternoon hours and then slowly declining towards the evening, yet remaining above average throughout the night. Humidity levels have seen a slight decrease through the day, indicating drier air moving into the area, which, combined with increasing temperatures, could lead to more uncomfortable conditions for residents. Air pressure has been relatively stable, with a slight downward trend observed, suggesting a potential for stable weather patterns in the near term, though the slight decrease could also precede a change in weather conditions. Wind speeds have been consistently light, with little variation, which may have contributed to the slight increase in temperatures by not providing significant cooling. Wind direction has been variable but predominantly from the east to northeast, which is typical for this region and may have influenced the gradual temperature increase seen during the day.
