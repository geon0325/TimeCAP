Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a significant upward trend in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the average positivity ratio of 6.26% being surpassed and reaching a peak of 27.03% in the most recent week. The number of specimens tested increased steadily, with a notable jump between weeks 15 and 16, suggesting increased surveillance or a response to rising infection rates. Influenza A has been the predominant strain, with its positivity rate peaking at 22.19% in week 19, although it slightly declined to 21.38% in week 20. Meanwhile, the positivity rate for Influenza B has been lower but shows a consistent increase, reaching 5.65% by week 20. This escalating trend in flu positivity rates indicates a substantial rise in influenza activity, which could strain healthcare resources and necessitates increased public health measures to manage the spread and impact of the infection.
