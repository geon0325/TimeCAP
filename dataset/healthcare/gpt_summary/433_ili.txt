Over the last 20 weeks, the proportion of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases has remained consistently below the 2.9% severity benchmark, suggesting a relatively mild influenza season. The highest ILI patient ratios were observed in the youngest age group (0-4 years), which peaked in the final week at 2.02%, indicating a potential area of focus for pediatric care and prevention efforts. Despite an overall trend of ILI ratios increasing towards the end of the 20-week period, the healthcare system has not been strained by a high influx of ILI cases. Notably, the age group of 25-49 years showed a slight uptick in the number of ILI cases in the last five weeks, which could signal an emerging trend that warrants closer monitoring. It is crucial for healthcare providers to maintain vigilance in tracking these trends, as even subthreshold ILI activity can impact vulnerable populations and healthcare resource allocation.
