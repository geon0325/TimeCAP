Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have shown a rising trend from the early hours, reaching a peak during the afternoon before gradually decreasing towards the evening. Relative humidity levels started high and reached saturation in the early morning, indicating a likelihood of fog or dew, but then decreased as temperatures rose, suggesting clearer conditions later in the day. Air pressure demonstrated a slight fluctuation but notably increased for a period, which might have been associated with transient weather systems passing through the area. Wind speeds were generally light but picked up significantly towards the end of the period, suggesting an increase in wind-related activity such as gusts or changes in weather patterns. The predominant wind direction was southeasterly, shifting more easterly later on, which typically brings moisture and could influence the development of precipitation or storms in the region.
