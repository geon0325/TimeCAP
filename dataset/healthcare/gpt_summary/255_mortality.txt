Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable decline in the ratio of mortality from influenza or pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, decreasing from a peak of 18.51% to 5.95%. This downward trend suggests a decrease in the relative impact of these respiratory diseases on overall mortality rates. However, it is notable that the absolute number of deaths from pneumonia remains significantly higher than those from influenza, indicating that pneumonia is a more prevalent concern within the observed period. Despite a reduction in the ratio of mortality from these conditions, the persistence of influenza and pneumonia as causes of death underscores the necessity for ongoing public health measures and clinical readiness. The fluctuation in total deaths over the period, with initial increases followed by a general decrease, may reflect seasonal patterns, the impact of healthcare interventions, or other epidemiological factors influencing mortality rates.
