Over the past 24 hours in New York City, there has been a notable increase in temperature reaching a peak during the afternoon, followed by a slight dip towards the evening, indicating a typical diurnal pattern with warmer daytime conditions. Humidity levels varied significantly, starting at moderate levels in the early hours, increasing considerably towards the morning, and then dropping sharply as temperatures peaked, suggesting a possible front passage or change in air masses affecting the area. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with only minor fluctuations, indicating a period of stable weather conditions without the immediate approach of significant weather systems. Wind speeds fluctuated, with generally light winds that increased to moderate speeds by the afternoon, which is consistent with the increase in temperature and could have contributed to the dispersion of humidity. Wind direction was highly variable, initially from the west, shifting to southerly directions, and then becoming predominantly from the south-southeast, which may have been responsible for the transportation of warmer air into the region.
