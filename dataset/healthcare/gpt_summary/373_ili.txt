Over the last 20 weeks, the proportion of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases among all age groups has shown a fluctuating pattern, with the percentage of ILI patients peaking at 2.67% in week 15 and then gradually declining to 1.67% by week 20. The highest volume of ILI cases was observed in the 5-24 age group, reaching a maximum of 20,746 cases in week 12, indicative of heightened transmission among school-aged children and young adults. Notably, the ILI percentage remained below the benchmark severity level of 2.9% throughout the period. The oldest age group (65 or more) consistently presented the lowest count of ILI cases, suggesting either lower transmission or underreporting in this demographic. The recent downtrend in ILI percentages could indicate the passing of the peak season, yet continuous monitoring is essential as it remains above the baseline of 1.3%, and a resurgence could strain healthcare resources.
