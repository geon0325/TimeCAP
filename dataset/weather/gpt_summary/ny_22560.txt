Over the past 24 hours in New York City, there has been a notable drop in temperature followed by a warming trend, indicating a potentially unstable and changing weather pattern. Humidity levels experienced a significant increase during the cooler early hours, which is typical due to cooler air holding less moisture, but then humidity decreased as temperatures rose again. Air pressure gradually increased throughout the period, suggesting a possible improvement in weather conditions or the arrival of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds remained relatively light and steady, indicating that wind did not play a major role in weather changes during this time. However, there was a shift in wind direction from predominantly northwesterly to southeasterly, which could be associated with the change in weather conditions, possibly bringing in different air masses that affect temperature and humidity.
