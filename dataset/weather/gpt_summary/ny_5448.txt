Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual rise in temperature, peaking during the late afternoon before a slight decrease towards the evening. Humidity levels showed significant variation, with a sharp decrease from saturation to much drier conditions as the day progressed, likely indicating the passage of a frontal system. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, suggesting a lack of major weather disturbances after the potential front passed. Wind speeds were generally light, but there was a period of calm followed by a slight increase in wind activity, which, along with variable wind directions, may have contributed to the change in humidity levels. Overall, the weather in New York City transitioned from potentially overcast or foggy conditions in the morning to clearer and drier conditions by the end of the day.
