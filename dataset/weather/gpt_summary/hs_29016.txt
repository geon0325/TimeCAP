Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a significant diurnal temperature variation, starting cooler in the early hours, warming up considerably during the day, and then cooling down again towards the evening. Humidity levels showed a decreasing trend as temperatures rose, which is typical as warmer air can hold more moisture before reaching saturation. Air pressure readings initially remained stable but showed some fluctuations later in the period, possibly indicating the approach or passage of a weather front. Wind speeds were generally light but increased around midday, aligning with the increase in temperature, which may have enhanced convective activity. The predominant wind direction shifted from northerly to southeasterly over the period, suggesting a change in the weather pattern, likely associated with the movement of a weather system through the area.
