Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a marked decrease in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with an initial high of 23.65% dropping to a current low of 0.90%. This decline is reflected in both Influenza A and B strains, with Influenza A showing a significant decrease from 18.16% to 0.40% and Influenza B from 5.49% to 0.50%. Despite the overall decrease in positivity rates, the number of specimens tested has also declined, with an initial 33,880 tests reducing to 5,978 in the most recent week, which could potentially mask the true prevalence of the virus due to fewer tests being conducted. The downward trend in the positivity rates suggests a waning influenza season; however, the healthcare system should remain vigilant for possible fluctuations and ensure adequate testing to monitor and respond to changing patterns. Additionally, the sustained but reduced presence of Influenza A and B highlights the need for continued public health messaging on vaccination and prevention strategies.
