Over the last 20 weeks, the incidence of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) has shown an upward trend, with the percentage of ILI patients increasing and recently surpassing the baseline level indicative of a significant influenza situation. Notably, the age group of 25-49 years has experienced a pronounced rise in ILI cases, suggesting a shift in the demographic most affected by the illness. The recent weeks have seen the ratio of ILI patients exceed the baseline, indicating a potential strain on healthcare resources and the need for increased vigilance and possibly enhanced public health measures. The peak in ILI percentage observed suggests we may be approaching or are in the midst of an influenza season, which requires healthcare providers to be prepared for increased patient loads and potential impacts on healthcare delivery. The data also reveals that the youngest (0-4 years) and oldest (65 years or more) age groups have consistently contributed to the ILI rates, which is a concern given their vulnerability to complications from influenza.
