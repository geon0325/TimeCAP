Over the last 20 weeks, the trend in Influenza-like Illness (ILI) across all age groups has shown a significant increase, with the percentage of ILI patients rising from 1.20% to 3.79%, exceeding the benchmark severity threshold of 2.9% in the last three weeks of the dataset. Notably, the age groups 0-4 and 5-24 have experienced the highest surge in ILI cases, suggesting that these populations could be particularly vulnerable or more socially active, therefore contributing more to the spread of the infection. The consistent increase in ILI cases across all age brackets indicates growing pressure on the healthcare system, as the peak of 3.79% represents a considerable elevation from the initial figures, potentially leading to increased hospitalizations and resource allocation challenges. The data reveals that the healthcare system may need to prepare for continued strain, particularly in pediatric and young adult care services. It also highlights the importance of public health interventions to mitigate the spread of ILI, especially among the most affected age groups.
