Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have experienced a mild fluctuation, indicating a relatively stable range with a gentle warming trend towards the latter hours. Humidity levels remained high throughout the period, peaking at full saturation during the nighttime and early morning hours, which potentially led to foggy conditions that are common in the bay area. Air pressure has been steadily high but showed a slight decreasing trend towards the end of the period, which could suggest a minor change in weather patterns or the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds remained light and calm, which is typical for the region and did not show significant variation, maintaining gentle conditions. The wind direction was predominantly from the west-southwest, which is consistent with the maritime influence on San Francisco's climate, and there was a slight shift in direction throughout the day that is typical for coastal areas.
