Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant fluctuation in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the average rate of 7.84%. The ratio started below average at 5.63% and exhibited a rising trend until reaching a peak of 19.40% in the 9th week, which corresponded with an atypically high total number of deaths (86888 and 87232 in the 8th and 9th weeks, respectively). Following this peak, there has been a consistent decline in both the number of deaths from Influenza or Pneumonia and the ratio, with the most recent week dropping to 8.15%, which is still slightly above the 20-week average. The spike in the mortality ratio coinciding with a surge in total deaths suggests a possible outbreak or seasonal epidemic, which could have placed additional strain on healthcare resources during that period. The recent downward trend towards the average ratio indicates a potential easing of this strain, but continued monitoring is necessary to ensure healthcare system preparedness for future fluctuations.
