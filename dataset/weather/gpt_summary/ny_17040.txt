Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, cooling significantly from its peak during the early hours. Humidity levels showed some variation, hitting their highest point near dawn, which could have resulted in some early morning fog or mist, later decreasing towards the afternoon, indicating drier conditions. Air pressure has been steadily increasing, which is typically associated with more stable weather conditions and clearer skies. Wind speeds remained moderate throughout the day with some fluctuations, but did not reach levels that would cause concern for severe weather events. The wind direction shifted from westerly to northerly and then to easterly, which could influence temperature and humidity as different air masses move into the area.
