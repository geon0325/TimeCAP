Humidity levels remained consistently high for most of the period, suggesting a moist air mass was present over the city, with a brief period where the humidity dropped significantly which could have been associated with a passing weather front. Air pressure experienced a notable drop at one point, which is often indicative of the approach or passage of a low-pressure system that could lead to unsettled weather conditions including increased wind speeds and potential precipitation.

The wind direction varied considerably, suggesting that the local weather patterns were somewhat unstable and changeable, with the possibility of shifting weather conditions in the near term.
