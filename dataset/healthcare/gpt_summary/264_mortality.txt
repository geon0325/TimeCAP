Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable decline in the proportion of deaths attributed to influenza and pneumonia when compared to the total number of deaths, falling from a high of 16.88% to a low of 5.81%, before slightly increasing to 6.20% in the final week. Despite this overall downward trend, the ratio of mortality from these respiratory conditions has fluctuated and remains above the average ratio of 7.84% for eleven of the twenty weeks analyzed. The total number of deaths has also decreased from 84,943 to 58,007, indicating a general improvement in mortality rates. However, the number of deaths from pneumonia, while decreasing substantially from 14,249 to 3,525, still represents a significant cause of mortality and warrants continued public health attention. The data suggests that interventions targeting influenza and pneumonia continue to be important, particularly as the colder months approach, which traditionally see a rise in such respiratory illnesses.
