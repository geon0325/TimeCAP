Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a gradual rise in temperature, indicating a warming trend after a cooler start. Humidity levels fluctuated, but there was a noticeable increase towards the end of the period, which could lead to a feeling of increased mugginess or the potential for fog development, especially when paired with the cooler overnight temperatures. Air pressure saw minor fluctuations but ended on a higher note, suggesting the potential for stable weather conditions to prevail in the short term. Wind speeds remained consistently low throughout the day, indicating a lack of significant weather fronts or storm systems moving through the area. The wind direction shifted from predominantly northwesterly to westerly and, finally, more southwesterly, which often brings warmer air from inland areas during this time of year.
