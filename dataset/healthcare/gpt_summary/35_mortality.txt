Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant increase in the proportion of deaths attributed to influenza or pneumonia, with the ratio of mortality from these causes to total deaths starting at 5.56% and rising to 10.89%. This trend indicates a worrying escalation, with the most notable jump occurring in the last three weeks of the data where the ratio exceeded the 20-week average of 7.84%. Specifically, the number of deaths from influenza saw a dramatic increase from 12 in the first week to 1626 in the last week, while pneumonia-related deaths also rose from 2825 to 5412 in the same period. The substantial rise in influenza deaths in the final weeks suggests a possible outbreak or a more virulent strain, which could strain healthcare resources and necessitate urgent public health interventions. The observed data may indicate a need for increased vaccination efforts, early detection and treatment strategies, as well as preparedness in healthcare settings to manage the higher influx of patients with severe respiratory conditions.
