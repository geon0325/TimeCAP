Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia to the total number of deaths has shown an alarming upward trend, significantly exceeding the average ratio of 7.84%. Initially, the ratio was at 8.12% and then exhibited a downward trend until the ninth week, reaching a low of 5.91%. However, following this period, there was a pronounced increase, with the ratio more than doubling to 16.83% by the eighteenth week, before slightly decreasing to 16.66% in the twentieth week. This increase is primarily driven by a surge in pneumonia-related deaths, which rose from 4771 to 12169, while the number of deaths from influenza remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations. The escalating ratio indicates a growing burden on the healthcare system from these respiratory conditions, necessitating urgent attention to mitigate further impact.
