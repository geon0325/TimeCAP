Over the past 24 hours in New York City, temperatures have shown a general decrease through the early hours, reaching a low before gradually rising again, indicative of a typical diurnal pattern with the warmest conditions occurring in the afternoon. Humidity levels experienced a significant increase during the night, which is common as temperatures drop, but they have since fluctuated, suggesting variable atmospheric moisture that could impact the comfort levels of residents. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase toward the middle of the period, which could be associated with transient high-pressure conditions that often bring clearer skies. Wind speeds varied, with some breezy conditions that could have made it feel cooler outdoors, particularly when wind speeds peaked. The wind direction was predominantly westerly, with some variability, which is consistent with weather systems moving from land toward the Atlantic Ocean.
