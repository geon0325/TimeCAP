Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, followed by a notable increase towards the later hours, indicating a dynamic range of temperatures throughout the day. Humidity levels varied significantly, starting at moderate levels before rising steeply and then decreasing, suggesting variable atmospheric moisture that could affect comfort levels. Air pressure showed a general increasing trend, which is often associated with stable weather conditions and might indicate a likelihood of continued fair weather. Wind speed remained relatively light and variable, with a tendency towards calm conditions, which could lead to the accumulation of pollutants in the absence of stronger winds to disperse them. The wind direction shifted dramatically over the period, starting from a westerly direction, veering to northerly, and then turning significantly to easterly, which may influence the transport of different air masses into the region.
