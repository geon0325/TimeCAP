Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, with the warmest conditions occurring in the late afternoon. Humidity levels have seen significant fluctuations, with periods of complete saturation alternating with lower humidity conditions, particularly in the late afternoon and evening. Air pressure has shown a slight declining trend throughout the day, which may indicate the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds have generally increased as the day progressed, peaking in the late afternoon and early evening, suggesting that a frontal system could be moving through the area. Wind direction has been predominantly from the southeast, which is typical for Houston and could be associated with the inflow of warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico, potentially contributing to the observed humidity levels.
