Over the last 24 hours, Houston experienced a slight decline in temperature which remained relatively stable throughout this period, indicative of steady weather conditions without any significant fluctuations in warmth. Humidity levels fluctuated, reaching full saturation at some points, which could suggest the presence of fog or mist, particularly during the early morning hours; these high humidity levels persisted towards the end of the observed period. Air pressure showed a slight decreasing trend, which might be associated with a change in weather patterns, such as the approach of a weather front. Wind speeds varied moderately, with periods of calmer winds interspersed with occasional gusts, while wind direction shifted several times, suggesting variability in wind patterns that could affect short-term weather conditions. Overall, the combination of high humidity, decreasing air pressure, and variable winds could indicate the potential for precipitation or the development of unsettled weather in the region.
