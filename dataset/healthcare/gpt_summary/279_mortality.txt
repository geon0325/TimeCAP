Over the last 20 weeks, the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia to total deaths has consistently remained below the average of 7.84%, with a range between 6.02% and 6.58%. Despite fluctuations, there is a slight overall upward trend in the absolute number of deaths attributed to pneumonia, while deaths from influenza have decreased, reaching a low in week 10, followed by a modest increase. The total number of deaths varied weekly, with a peak at week 11, but did not show a significant upward or downward trend. The highest mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia was recorded at 6.58% in week 14, which is still notably lower than the average ratio. This data suggests a relatively stable situation regarding Influenza or Pneumonia mortality as a proportion of total deaths, but continuous monitoring is essential to detect any changes that could strain healthcare resources.
