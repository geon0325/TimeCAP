Over the past 24 hours in New York City, there has been a gradual increase in temperature followed by a slight decrease, indicating a typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels have shown an overall upward trend, which could contribute to a feeling of increased chilliness despite the rise in temperature. Air pressure has remained relatively high and stable, suggesting the presence of a high-pressure system that is typically associated with fair weather conditions.
