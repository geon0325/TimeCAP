Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable warming trend, with the temperature peaking in the late afternoon before gradually cooling down. Humidity levels showed a reverse trend, starting relatively lower during the warmest part of the day and increasing towards the evening and night, which could lead to a feeling of mugginess. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with only minor fluctuations, indicating steady weather conditions. Wind speed was consistently light, with very calm conditions observed during the night, which could lead to the formation of fog or mist if other conditions are favorable. A significant shift in wind direction occurred, transitioning from southeasterly to westerly and then to northeasterly, suggesting the passage of a weather front or localized weather systems affecting the area.
