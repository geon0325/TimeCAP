Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a fluctuating trend in the number of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a notable increase in the total number of specimens tested from 11,644 to 16,557. The ratio of positive specimens for both Influenza A and B has generally remained below the 20-week average of 6.26%, peaking at 4.17% in week one and reaching a low of 1.34% in week 11. Influenza A has shown a slight upward trend in the percentage of positive specimens in recent weeks, rising to 1.50% in week 20 from a low of 0.82% in week 11. In contrast, Influenza B has seen a decrease in the percentage of positive specimens, dropping to 0.59% in week 20 from a high of 2.70% in week one. These trends suggest a predominance of Influenza A cases in the later weeks and may indicate the need for increased vigilance and potential adjustments in healthcare resource allocation to manage the fluctuating demands of influenza outbreaks.
