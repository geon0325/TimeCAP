Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia as a percentage of total deaths has generally hovered below the 20-week average of 7.84%, with ratios for 19 weeks ranging from 6.05% to 6.58%. However, there was a significant spike in the final week, with the ratio jumping to 14.15%, which is almost double the average and could indicate an outbreak or increased mortality due to these diseases. Total deaths peaked in the last week at 68,969, coinciding with the sharp increase in the ratio of deaths from Influenza or Pneumonia, suggesting a potential correlation between a rising number of deaths and the incidence of these illnesses. The number of deaths from pneumonia showed an increasing trend in the last week, with a value of 9,741, which is significantly higher than the weekly values reported in the previous weeks (ranging from 3,367 to 3,816). This sudden rise in both total deaths and the proportion of deaths from Influenza or Pneumonia could strain healthcare resources and warrants further investigation to understand the underlying causes and to implement appropriate healthcare measures.
