Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable decrease in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia relative to the total number of deaths when compared to the average ratio of 7.84%, with the ratios oscillating between 5.21% and 5.85%. The total number of deaths fluctuated during this period, with a peak at week 20 (52,110 deaths), while the lowest was recorded in week 10 (50,274 deaths). Deaths attributed to influenza remained low, with a slight increase towards the end of the period, indicating a possible seasonal trend or outbreak. Pneumonia deaths showed a slight downward trend until week 19, with an uptick in week 20 to 3,022 deaths. These trends suggest a reduced burden of influenza and pneumonia on the healthcare system in the last 20 weeks but warrant continued monitoring for potential increases in mortality.
