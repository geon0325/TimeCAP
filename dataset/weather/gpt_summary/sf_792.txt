Over the last 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a gradual increase in temperature, reaching a peak in the late afternoon before stabilizing. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with a notable peak during the night which coincides with a sharp drop in air pressure, suggesting the possible development of a weather front or system during that time. Air pressure was generally stable, but the sudden decrease could have been associated with transient weather conditions that may affect the region. Wind speed varied from calm to moderate breezes throughout the day, with wind direction shifting erratically, indicating a lack of a dominant weather system. The combination of these factors suggests a day that started cooler and more stable, moving towards slightly warmer and potentially unsettled conditions by the evening.
