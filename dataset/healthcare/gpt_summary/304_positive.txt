Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable increase in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the average positive ratio rising to 6.26%. Influenza A has shown a substantial uptick in positive cases, escalating from a mere 0.05% in the first week to a striking 6.17% by the end of the period, suggesting a significant outbreak. The data for Influenza B, while also showing an increase, remained relatively stable with a less pronounced rise in positive cases, indicating a less aggressive spread compared to Influenza A. The overall ratio of positive specimens has grown from 0.11% to 6.23% over the 20-week period, marking a concerning upward trend that could potentially strain healthcare resources. This surge in influenza activity underscores the need for increased vigilance, vaccination efforts, and preparedness to manage the heightened demand for medical care and to mitigate further transmission.
