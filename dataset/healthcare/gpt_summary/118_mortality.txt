Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable decline in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia when compared to the total number of deaths, with the ratio decreasing from 6.76% to 5.11%, which is below the average ratio of 7.84%. The total number of deaths fluctuated slightly but showed a minor decreasing trend from 55,477 to 50,999. The number of deaths specifically from influenza has seen a significant drop from 303 to 6, indicating a potential reduction in influenza prevalence or improved management of the condition. Pneumonia-related deaths also decreased over the period, from 3,450 to 2,602, contributing to the overall decline in the mortality ratio. This trend might indicate a positive response to public health interventions, vaccine efficacy, or seasonal variations, but continuous monitoring is necessary to manage healthcare resources and guide preventive measures effectively.
