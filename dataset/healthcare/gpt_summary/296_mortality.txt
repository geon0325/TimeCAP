Over the last 20 weeks, mortality from influenza and pneumonia has fluctuated significantly when compared to the total number of deaths, deviating from the average ratio of 7.84%. The data reveals a notable peak in the ratio of mortality from influenza and pneumonia to total deaths around weeks 15 through 17, with the highest spike reaching 13.74%, likely indicating a severe outbreak during this period. In contrast, the early weeks showed a ratio consistently below the average, suggesting a relatively mild impact from these illnesses at that time. The most dramatic increase was observed in deaths from influenza between weeks 17 and 18, where deaths surged from 152 to 887, which may point to an exceptionally virulent strain or a lapse in preventive measures. Despite this spike, the latest data indicates a downward trend in the ratio of mortality from these respiratory conditions, which could suggest a return to average levels or the effectiveness of interventions, but continued monitoring is essential to ensure healthcare readiness.
