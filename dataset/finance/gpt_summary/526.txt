Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with an overall downward trend, closing lower by 10.50 points from its starting position, which may indicate a cautious or bearish market sentiment. The VIX, commonly known as the fear gauge, has increased overall, moving from 22.91 to 26.67, suggesting that investor uncertainty and market volatility have risen. International markets have mirrored this uncertainty, with the Nikkei 225 showing fluctuations but ending slightly higher, while the FTSE 100 has demonstrated resilience with a notable uptrend, gaining 167.70 points overall.

Commodity prices have seen mixed trends; Gold Futures have declined significantly by 117.10, indicating a possible shift by investors towards assets perceived as riskier, whereas Crude Oil Futures have risen by 5.59, potentially reflecting economic optimism or supply constraints. Currency markets have remained relatively stable, with minor fluctuations in EUR/USD, USD/JPY, and USD/CNY exchange rates, suggesting that currency traders are maintaining a wait-and-see approach amidst global market volatility.
