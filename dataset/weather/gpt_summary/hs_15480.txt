Over the last 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual increase in temperature, peaking in the late afternoon before showing a slight dip towards the evening. The humidity levels were quite high throughout the day, reaching saturation in the early hours, which could have led to foggy conditions, before decreasing as the temperature rose. Air pressure remained relatively stable with only minor fluctuations, indicating no immediate signs of significant weather events such as storms. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with an increase observed towards the end of the period, which might help disperse humidity and could offer some relief from the heat. The wind direction varied but was predominantly from the south to southeast, which is typical for Houston and could be responsible for bringing in moisture from the Gulf, contributing to the higher humidity levels observed.
