Over the past day, San Francisco has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature, with a cooling trend in the early hours followed by a gradual warming. The humidity levels have been relatively high, suggesting a moist atmosphere which may have contributed to a feeling of chilliness despite the moderate temperatures. Air pressure remained quite stable, indicating consistent weather patterns without significant disturbances. Wind speeds were generally low, occasionally dropping to calm conditions, with wind direction showing variability, including periods of calm when the wind direction was not discernible. The combination of high humidity, stable pressure, and low winds could lead to fog formation, particularly in coastal and bay areas of San Francisco, which is common in this region.
