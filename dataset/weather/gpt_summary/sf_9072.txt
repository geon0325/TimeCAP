Over the past day, San Francisco has experienced a notable fluctuation in temperature, with a general trend of cooling overnight and warming during the day. Humidity levels have shown significant variability, with a tendency toward higher humidity during the cooler early morning hours, which may have contributed to early morning fog typical for the area.
