Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a consistent decline in the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, with a slight uptick in recent weeks. The mortality ratio has decreased from 5.77% to 4.90% at its lowest point, before rising again to 5.68%, which is still below the average ratio of 7.84%. The absolute number of deaths from pneumonia has shown a gradual decrease from 3045 to 2515, before increasing to 2989 in the final week. Similarly, deaths from influenza have remained relatively low, with a slight increase in the last reported week to 18 deaths. This trend suggests a potential easing of Influenza or Pneumonia burden on the healthcare system, but the recent rise warrants continued monitoring to mitigate any resurgence.
