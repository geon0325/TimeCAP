Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable uptrend in the mortality ratio of Influenza or Pneumonia relative to total deaths, starting at 7.43% and peaking at 16.83% before slightly declining to 15.03%, far surpassing the 20-week average of 7.84%. This increase coincides with a rise in absolute numbers, with pneumonia deaths escalating sharply from 4350 to a peak of 12325, before reducing to 10683 in the latest week. Influenza deaths remained relatively low but showed an increase in the latter weeks, rising from single digits to a high of 32 deaths. The peak in mortality from these illnesses corresponds with the highest total number of deaths recorded in the 20-week period, suggesting a possible strain on healthcare resources during this time. The observed trend indicates a critical need for heightened preventive and management strategies for respiratory illnesses within the healthcare system.
