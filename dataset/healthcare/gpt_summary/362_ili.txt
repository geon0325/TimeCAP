Over the last 20 weeks, the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data reveals a fluctuating trend with an initial phase of rising ILI ratios, peaking mid-time series, followed by a decline, and a modest uptick towards the end of the period. The highest ratios were observed in the early weeks, significantly exceeding the baseline, indicating a surge that would have likely put additional strain on healthcare resources. The data shows a subsequent decrease in ILI ratios to below the baseline, suggesting a relief period for the healthcare system. However, there has been a slight increase in recent weeks, signaling a potential uptick in ILI cases that warrants close monitoring. Age-wise, the most significant ILI occurrences were among the 25-49 age group during the peak period, which may suggest a higher transmission rate or susceptibility in this demographic, necessitating targeted public health interventions.
