Over the last 20 weeks, the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) trends have displayed an initial period below the baseline ratio for determining an influenza outbreak, followed by a sustained increase that eventually surpassed the baseline. The most significant surge in ILI cases occurred in the higher age groups, particularly among individuals aged 25-49 and 50-64, which could indicate a greater susceptibility or increased exposure in these populations. Notably, there was an eventual peak where the ratio of ILI patients markedly exceeded the baseline, suggesting a point of heightened healthcare demand, and potentially signaling an epidemic phase. Following this peak, there has been a decline in the ratio of ILI patients, yet it remains above the baseline, indicating that the healthcare system may still be under increased pressure. The trend suggests that while the situation might be improving, sustained monitoring and preparedness are essential to manage ongoing and future ILI cases effectively.
