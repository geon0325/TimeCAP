Humidity levels showed major fluctuations, with the highest levels coinciding with the lowest temperatures in the early morning, which is common due to overnight cooling leading to condensation.

Wind speeds were mostly calm but picked up noticeably in the latest hours, possibly indicating a change in weather patterns or the approach of a frontal system. The wind direction was predominantly from the north-northeast, except for a brief shift to westerly winds, which could have been associated with localized weather disturbances.
