Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature, with a general cooling trend during the early hours and a subsequent warming trend peaking in the late afternoon. Humidity levels remained high throughout most of the period but showed a relative decrease during the daytime, which is typical as temperatures rise. Air pressure experienced minor variations indicating relatively stable atmospheric conditions, although there was a slight drop towards the evening, which could suggest an approaching weather system. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with an increase observed during the late afternoon and evening hours, potentially contributing to the dispersal of any coastal fog and bringing clearer conditions. The wind direction varied significantly, which is characteristic of the region's complex topography and coastal influence, possibly affecting localized weather patterns such as microclimates within the city.
