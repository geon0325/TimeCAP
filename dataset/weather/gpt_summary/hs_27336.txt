Over the last 24 hours in Houston, the temperature exhibited a diurnal pattern with the coolest conditions around dawn and a notable increase reaching its peak in the late afternoon before descending slightly in the evening. Humidity levels showed an inverse relationship to temperature, increasing as temperatures dropped overnight and decreasing through the warmer afternoon hours, indicating a typical pattern where warmer air can hold more moisture. Air pressure experienced a slight overall decrease throughout the period, suggesting a possible approach of a weather system that could lead to changing conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a slight increase during the afternoon, which could contribute to a dispersion of humidity and potentially influence local thermal comfort. The wind direction was predominantly from the east-northeast, shifting more to the southeast later in the period, which may bring moisture from the Gulf of Mexico into the region, potentially affecting weather patterns in the following days.
