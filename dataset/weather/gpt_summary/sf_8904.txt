Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature, with a notable increase during the day followed by a decrease towards the evening and night, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels have shown a significant range, with the highest levels occurring during the cooler early morning hours and decreasing sharply as temperatures peaked. Air pressure experienced a substantial drop towards the end of the period, which could signify the approach of a weather system with the potential for changing weather conditions. Wind speeds have remained relatively light throughout the period, with little variation, suggesting stable weather patterns; however, the wind direction has varied widely, indicating that multiple air masses may be influencing the area's weather. The combined data on temperature, humidity, air pressure, and wind suggest a period of variable weather that could culminate in changing conditions due to the significant drop in air pressure observed.
