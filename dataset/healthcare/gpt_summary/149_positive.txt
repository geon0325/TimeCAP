Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a significant increase in the ratio of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the percentage rising from 0.76% to 16.35%. The increase is primarily attributable to Influenza A, which showed a more pronounced surge from 0.51% to 15.79% of the specimens tested, suggesting a dominant strain in the current flu season. In contrast, Influenza B has demonstrated a relatively stable presence with a less steep increase from 0.25% to 0.56%. The peak in positive tests for Influenza A in recent weeks indicates a potential strain on healthcare resources, necessitating increased vigilance and preparedness for managing flu-related illnesses. Given the upward trend, healthcare providers should be alert to the possibility of continued growth in influenza cases, which could lead to higher hospitalization rates and a need for enhanced preventative measures, such as vaccination campaigns and public health advisories.
