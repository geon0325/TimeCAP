Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a mild temperature range with a notable increase in the last few hours, which may indicate an incoming warm front. Humidity levels remained predominantly high throughout the day, suggesting a moist air mass was present, which could lead to cloud formation or fog, particularly during the cooler early morning and late evening hours. Air pressure was relatively stable but showed a significant drop recently, which is typically associated with the approach of a low-pressure system that could result in unsettled weather conditions. Wind speeds were light and variable, with a slight uptick in the last couple of hours, while wind direction shifted markedly, indicating a change in the local weather pattern. The combination of rising temperatures, high humidity, dropping pressure, and changing wind patterns could signal the potential for a weather system moving into the area, possibly bringing precipitation or a change in weather conditions.
