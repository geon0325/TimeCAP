Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, reaching its lowest point before a notable increase towards the end of the period. Humidity levels were consistently high, often reaching saturation, which could have contributed to foggy conditions or the potential for precipitation. Air pressure varied significantly, with a sharp peak and subsequent drop, indicative of changing weather patterns that could influence wind conditions and temperature. Wind speeds remained mostly light to moderate throughout the period, with a significant shift in wind direction occurring midway through, suggesting the passage of a weather front or change in weather systems. The combination of high humidity, varying air pressure, and shifting wind directions points to an unsettled weather pattern, likely affecting visibility and possibly leading to changes in weather conditions such as increased cloud cover or the chance of rain.
