Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia to total deaths has shown an upward trend, peaking at 8.33% in the 10th week, which significantly exceeds the 20-week average of 7.84%. Notably, there was a sharp increase in deaths attributed to influenza from week 8 onward, culminating in week 20 with 543 deaths, which is more than 23 times higher than the count in the first week. Pneumonia-related deaths also increased, reaching a high in week 10 with 4418 deaths. Despite fluctuations, the mortality ratio remained above the overall 20-week average in the latter half of the period, suggesting a growing impact of these respiratory conditions on overall mortality. These trends indicate a potential strain on healthcare resources and highlight the need for increased medical preparedness and preventive measures, especially for managing severe respiratory infections.
