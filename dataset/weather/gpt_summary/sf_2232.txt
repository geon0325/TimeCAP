Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a moderate fluctuation in temperature, with a general warming trend observed after a dip earlier in the period. Humidity levels varied significantly, peaking during the cooler early hours, which may have contributed to a sensation of chilliness, but later stabilized at lower values indicative of drier conditions. Air pressure saw a slight decreasing trend overall, suggesting a possible change in weather patterns or the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate and decreased to calm conditions by the end of the period; wind direction was variable, but predominantly from northerly and easterly directions, which is typical for this region. The combination of rising temperatures, lower humidity, and steady air pressure towards the end of the 24-hour period indicates stable weather conditions, but the initial variability in these indicators suggests that residents may have experienced changing weather throughout the day.
