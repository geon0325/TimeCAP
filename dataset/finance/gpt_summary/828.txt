Over the past 20 market days, the S&P 500 has exhibited volatility with a general downward trend, closing lower at 3930.08 from an initial 4392.59, which suggests a bearish market sentiment. The VIX, known as the fear index, has risen during this period, starting at 22.70 and ending at 31.77, which indicates an increase in market uncertainty and risk. Global indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have also shown declines, particularly the Nikkei 225 with a noticeable drop from 27172.00 to 25748.72, reflecting broader market concerns.

Commodity prices have seen mixed movements; Gold Futures have decreased from 1970.90 to 1823.80, signaling a potential shift away from safe-haven assets, while Crude Oil Futures have fluctuated but ended slightly lower at 106.13 from 106.95, which could relate to changing views on economic growth and demand. Currency markets have seen the Dollar strengthening against the Euro and the Japanese Yen but slightly weakening against the Chinese Yuan, suggesting currency-specific factors and possibly different regional economic outlooks.
