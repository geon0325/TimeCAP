Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have experienced a gentle fluctuation, indicative of a typical diurnal pattern with a cooling trend during the nighttime and a gradual warming during daylight hours. Humidity levels have been notably high, even reaching saturation at several points, which could suggest the presence of fog or mist, particularly during the early morning when temperatures were lowest. Atmospheric pressure has remained relatively stable with only minor variations, suggesting a period of settled weather without significant fronts or storms passing through the area. Wind speeds have been mostly light to moderate, with a brief period of calm winds, and the prevailing wind direction has been from the northwest, with occasional shifts, which is common for the region. The combination of high humidity, stable pressure, and light winds is conducive to the formation of coastal fog, a common occurrence in San Francisco, which may have implications for visibility and local climate conditions.
