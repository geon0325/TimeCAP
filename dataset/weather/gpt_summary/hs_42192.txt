Over the past 24 hours, the weather in Houston has exhibited a gradual increase in temperature followed by a slight decrease towards the current hour, indicating a typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels have seen fluctuations but showed a significant drop during the warmer part of the day, likely due to the increase in temperature reducing relative humidity, and then spiked later, which could suggest an evening or nocturnal increase in moisture. Air pressure remained fairly stable throughout the period, with only minor variations, suggesting a relatively steady weather pattern without the immediate approach of a significant weather system. Wind speeds varied modestly and were generally light to gentle, with occasional higher gusts, while wind direction shifted throughout the day, suggesting the presence of variable and possibly competing weather fronts. The combination of increasing temperature, varying humidity, and stable pressure, alongside the changing wind patterns, could point to typical, albeit slightly unsettled local weather conditions without any extreme weather events in the immediate forecast.
