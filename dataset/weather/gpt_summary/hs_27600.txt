Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a gradual increase in temperature, suggesting a warming trend. Relative humidity levels remained high throughout the day, peaking at full saturation, which may have contributed to a feeling of mugginess and the potential for fog or dew. Air pressure experienced a notable but brief increase mid-day before stabilizing, indicating a transient high-pressure system that could have led to clearer skies temporarily. Wind speeds varied, with a slight increase later in the period, reflecting a change in weather conditions that might affect outdoor activities. The wind direction was predominantly from the southeast, with some variability, which is typical for the region and can influence moisture levels and temperatures in Houston.
