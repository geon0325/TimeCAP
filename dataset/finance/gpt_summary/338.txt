Over the past 20 market days, the S&P 500 has exhibited a general uptrend, rising from 2848.42 to 3122.87, indicating improved investor sentiment. Concurrently, the VIX, a measure of market volatility, has trended downwards from 34.12 to 25.66, which aligns with the increasing stability in stock markets. In international markets, both the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have shown similar upward momentum, with the Nikkei increasing from 19619.35 to 22613.76, and the FTSE 100 climbing from 5853.80 to 6382.40, suggesting a global recovery trend. Gold Futures, however, after an initial spike, have declined towards the end of the period, from 1684.20 to 1697.80, potentially reflecting a shift in investor preference from safe havens to riskier assets. Crude Oil Futures have recovered significantly from 23.99 to 37.29, likely due to production cuts and a gradual increase in demand, while the EUR/USD and USD/CNY exchange rates have both strengthened against the USD, moving from 1.08 to 1.12 and from 7.06 to 7.10 respectively, which could be indicative of a weakening dollar amidst global economic developments.
