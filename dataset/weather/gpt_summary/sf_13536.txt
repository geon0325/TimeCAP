Over the last 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures exhibited a typical diurnal pattern, starting off warmer, cooling significantly overnight, and then warming up again during the day. Relative humidity showed fluctuations, starting high, decreasing towards the middle of the day as temperatures rose, and then increasing again towards the evening and into the night, which is common as temperatures drop. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, suggesting a stable or strengthening high-pressure system that could lead to clearer skies and calmer weather. Wind speeds varied, with some hours experiencing gentle breezes and others having brisk winds, while wind direction primarily shifted between westerly and northwesterly flows, typical of coastal California's weather patterns. The combination of moderately high humidity, increasing air pressure, and consistent wind conditions might indicate a pattern of cool, possibly foggy mornings clearing to sunny afternoons, which is characteristic of the San Francisco climate.
