Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have exhibited a typical diurnal cycle, with a gradual increase reaching a peak in the late afternoon before cooling towards the early hours of the morning. Relative humidity levels have fluctuated significantly, peaking at night, which could have led to early morning fog or dew, and then decreasing during the day, likely due to rising temperatures. Atmospheric pressure has remained relatively stable, with a slight decreasing trend suggesting a potential change in weather patterns or the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds varied, with calmer conditions during the early morning hours and progressively becoming more brisk towards the evening, which could contribute to a change in temperature or humidity levels. Wind direction has been predominantly from the south to southeast, which in Houston often indicates a flow of warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico, affecting both temperature and humidity.
