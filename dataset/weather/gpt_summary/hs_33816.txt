Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a notable increase in temperature, peaking during the later hours before showing a slight decrease towards the current hour. Humidity levels have shown a general decrease through the day, which is typical as temperatures rise, but they remained relatively high during the overnight and early morning hours, suggesting a muggy atmosphere. Air pressure has been fairly stable, with a slight overall decrease, indicating that there hasn't been a significant change in the weather systems affecting the area. Wind speeds have been consistently light, with minimal fluctuation, which could lead to stagnation of the air and potentially higher pollutant levels. The wind direction has shifted from southeasterly to southerly and then to west-southwesterly, which may have contributed to the warmer temperatures experienced due to the possible advection of warm air from inland areas.
