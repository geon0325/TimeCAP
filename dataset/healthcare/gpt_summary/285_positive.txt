Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a slight fluctuation in the number of respiratory specimens testing positive for both Influenza A and B, with the overall positivity rate for specimens averaging 6.26% but reaching as high as 0.15% in certain weeks. The highest observed weekly positivity rate for Influenza A was 0.08%, whereas for Influenza B, it peaked at 0.09%. The data indicates a potential increase in the spread of Influenza B compared to A, as evidenced by higher or equal weekly positive specimen ratios for B in 13 out of 20 weeks. The variability in the positivity rates, which do not show a consistent trend either increasing or decreasing, suggests a need for ongoing surveillance. Given that the weekly number of specimens tested has decreased over the period, from 35763 to 28889, the healthcare system should remain vigilant for possible underestimation of the true incidence rate due to potentially reduced testing.
