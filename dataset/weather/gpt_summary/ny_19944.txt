Over the past 24 hours in New York City, temperatures have experienced a gradual increase, indicating a warming trend after a cooler start. Despite this rise in temperature, humidity levels have remained relatively stable, with a slight peak coinciding with the lowest temperatures, which is typical as cooler air can hold less moisture. Air pressure has shown an overall increase, suggesting the strengthening of a high-pressure system which is often associated with clearer skies and calmer weather. Wind speeds have been consistently light and have not shown significant fluctuations, indicating a period of tranquil weather conditions. The wind direction has varied, primarily coming from the west-southwest, shifting towards the south-southwest, which is common for the region and could contribute to the gradual warming observed.
