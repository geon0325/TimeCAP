Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperature displayed a decreasing trend during the night, reaching its lowest point just before dawn, followed by a notable increase as the day progressed. Humidity levels remained at saturation for several hours, indicating the presence of fog or heavy mist, particularly at night and early morning, before decreasing slightly towards the end of the period. The air pressure was relatively stable for most of the period but showed a significant drop towards the end, which could signal an approaching weather system that may lead to changing weather conditions. Wind speeds varied, with some gusty conditions occurring, however, there were periods of calm with no wind. The wind direction shifted periodically, ranging from northerly to westerly and back to northerly, which is typical for the region and may contribute to variations in coastal weather patterns including fog dispersal and temperature changes.
