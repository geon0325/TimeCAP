Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before stabilizing slightly below the day's maximum. Humidity levels exhibited a decreasing trend throughout the day, with a significant drop occurring from morning to afternoon, indicative of drier air moving into the area. Air pressure experienced some fluctuations, with a notable decrease towards the evening, suggesting the potential development of a low-pressure system that might affect weather patterns such as increased cloudiness or precipitation chances.
