Over the past 20 weeks, the number of respiratory specimens tested for influenza has shown an overall increasing trend, peaking at 23,131 in the latest week. The ratio of positive specimens has fluctuated, with an initial decrease followed by a spike to 3.46% in week 13, but has since dropped to below the 20-week average of 6.26%, with the last recorded ratio at 1.55%. Influenza B has been more prevalent than Influenza A throughout the period, peaking at 2.10% in week 13 compared to Influenza A's peak at 1.46% in week 5. However, the ratio of positive specimens for Influenza A and B has declined in recent weeks, with Influenza A dropping to 0.74% and Influenza B to 0.81% in the last week. This overall decrease in positivity rates suggests a downward trend in influenza prevalence, which may reduce the burden on healthcare resources dedicated to influenza management but warrants continued surveillance for potential re-surges.
