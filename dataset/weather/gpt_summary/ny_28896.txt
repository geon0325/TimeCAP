Over the past 24 hours in New York City, temperatures have experienced a subtle rising trend, indicating a slight warm-up in conditions. Relative humidity levels have shown significant variations, with notable drops suggesting periods of drier air interspersed with spikes that could have contributed to a feeling of chilliness, especially when temperatures were lower. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, indicating no significant weather fronts passing through the area that would prompt drastic weather changes. Wind speeds have been moderate but increased towards the latter part of the period, which could potentially lead to windier conditions that may affect outdoor activities. The wind direction has been primarily westerly to northwesterly, which is typical for the passage of a weather system and could be responsible for the transport of cooler air into the region.
