The analysis of the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data over the last 20 weeks indicates a fluctuating but overall increasing trend in the ratio of ILI patients, which recently has been on the rise but still remains below the baseline of 2.9% for determining heightened influenza activity. The age group 0-4 years consistently shows the highest number of ILI patients compared to other age groups, suggesting that young children are currently the most affected demographic. Notably, there has been a steady increase in ILI cases in all age groups over the last five weeks, indicating a potential uptick in influenza activity as we progress through the season. Despite the increase, the healthcare system is not currently experiencing an influenza epidemic, as the ILI ratio has not surpassed the epidemic threshold; however, the upward trend warrants close monitoring. Public health officials and healthcare providers should remain vigilant and may consider increasing awareness about influenza prevention measures, especially among parents of young children who are showing a higher incidence of ILI.
