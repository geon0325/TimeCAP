Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before slowly beginning to decline. Humidity levels showed significant variation, with notably high humidity in the early morning hours, decreasing significantly as the temperature peaked, and then rising again slightly towards the end of the period. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight decrease, which is typical during warmer conditions and could be associated with the development of low-pressure systems that may affect weather patterns. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate throughout the day, with some variability in intensity, but no significant gusts were observed. The predominant wind directions have been generally from the south to southwest, which is common for warmer and more humid air masses moving into the area.
