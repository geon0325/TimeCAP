The analysis of the last 20 weeks of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data indicates that the overall ratio of ILI patients has remained well below the baseline of 2.9%, suggesting that the current healthcare burden from ILI is lower than the threshold of concern. However, there has been a gradual increase in the ILI ratio over the period, which could signal a rising trend in influenza cases that warrants close monitoring. Notably, the age group 0-4 has seen a consistent increase in ILI cases, suggesting that young children are currently the most affected demographic, which may have implications for pediatric healthcare resources. The age groups 25-49 and 50-64 showed a decline followed by stabilization in ILI cases, indicating a potential plateauing of cases in these demographics. Meanwhile, the age group 65 or more has remained relatively stable with a slight increase towards the end of the period, highlighting the need for continued vigilance in monitoring at-risk populations such as the elderly.
