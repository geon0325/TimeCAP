Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have exhibited a typical diurnal pattern with a peak during the daytime and a drop overnight, maintaining mild to warm conditions throughout. Humidity levels have fluctuated significantly but remained generally high, suggesting a moist air mass over the region which could lead to foggy conditions, especially during the cooler night and morning hours. Air pressure has seen some variability with a slight decreasing trend, potentially indicating an approaching weather system that could bring changes in the near future. Wind speeds have been moderate with some periods of increased velocity, and the prevailing wind direction has been predominantly from the west-northwest, which is common for the city due to its coastal location. The combination of these weather indicators suggests a stable yet moist weather pattern, with the potential for coastal fog and a slight chance of changing conditions if the pressure continues to drop.
