Over the past 24 hours in New York City, temperatures have exhibited a consistent downward trend, indicative of a cooling pattern that is common during the nighttime and into the early morning hours. Humidity levels have fluctuated moderately, with peaks suggesting the potential for a muggy feel to the air, particularly when combined with higher temperatures. Air pressure has been steadily increasing, which typically signals more stable weather conditions and possibly clearer skies. Wind speeds have varied, with occasional gusty conditions, but without any persistent strong winds, suggesting a relatively calm wind pattern overall. The wind direction has been variable, with a notable shift from predominantly westerly to northeasterly directions, which could lead to changes in temperature and moisture levels due to the different air masses these directions usually bring.
