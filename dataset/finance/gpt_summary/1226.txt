Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown an upward trend, increasing from 4495.70 to 4643.70, which suggests a positive sentiment among investors. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, has slightly decreased from 14.16 to 12.07, indicating a decrease in expected market volatility and potentially more stability in the market. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 displayed relative stability with a slight upward trend, closing higher at the end of the period, which could reflect steady investor confidence in these markets. Gold futures experienced some volatility but remained above the $1970 mark, suggesting that investors may still be cautious, hedging against potential market risks. The exchange rates for EUR/USD and USD/JYP have remained relatively stable, with minor fluctuations, while the USD/CNY has seen a slight depreciation, which could have implications for international trade balances and economic dynamics between the US and China.
