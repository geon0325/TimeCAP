Humidity levels were highly variable; they peaked at saturation during certain hours, indicative of possible fog or heavy dew, and were lowest in the late afternoon, coinciding with the highest temperatures. Air pressure remained relatively steady throughout the period, with a slight decrease noted towards the most recent hours, which could suggest a gradual change in weather patterns or an approaching weather system.
