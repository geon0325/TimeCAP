Over the last 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have experienced a diurnal pattern, peaking during the afternoon and ebbing to their lowest values in the early morning hours, indicative of typical daily temperature fluctuation. Humidity levels have shown significant variation, with the highest percentages occurring during the coolest parts of the day, which is a common occurrence as cooler air holds less moisture, leading to higher relative humidity. Atmospheric pressure has remained relatively stable, with only minor fluctuations that suggest settled weather conditions without the presence of significant weather fronts. Wind speeds have generally been light to moderate, with a period of calm conditions; however, the wind directions have been variable, showing no dominant wind pattern over the period. The combination of these factors indicates that the weather has been relatively stable, with the usual variations associated with the time of day and localized atmospheric conditions.
