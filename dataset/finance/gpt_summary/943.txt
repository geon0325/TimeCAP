Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 experienced volatility, initially declining but recovering later with a notable increase, ending slightly lower than its peak in this period, indicative of uncertainty but with a bullish undertone. The VIX, reflecting this volatility, started high and trended downwards, suggesting a decrease in market fear and potential stabilization of the market. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 generally trended upwards, which could indicate a growing investor confidence in global markets. Commodities saw mixed movements; Gold Futures fluctuated but ended slightly higher, signaling cautious investor sentiment, while Crude Oil Futures increased, pointing towards potential rising energy costs. Currency exchange rates saw the Euro and the Japanese Yen losing ground to the USD, with the Euro recovering to parity at the end; the Chinese Yuan consistently depreciated against the USD, which may suggest concerns over economic growth in China and potential impacts on international trade.
