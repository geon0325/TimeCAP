Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have displayed a cyclical pattern with a peak during the day, followed by a cooler nighttime period and a subsequent increase towards the following day. Humidity levels have shown an inverse relationship with temperature, where higher temperatures correspond with lower humidity and vice versa, reaching its peak during the coolest part of the early morning. Air pressure has remained relatively stable, with only slight fluctuations, indicating a period of steady weather conditions without significant front movements or storm systems. Wind speeds have been mostly light, with a slight increase during the hours associated with lower temperatures, which could contribute to the feeling of cooler conditions at night. Lastly, wind direction has been variable but predominantly from the south-southeast, which is typical for Houston and may be responsible for bringing in moisture that affects humidity levels.
