Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia has fluctuated, with a general trend of remaining below the historic average ratio of 7.84%. The actual ratio of mortality from these causes to total deaths ranged from 5.36% to 6.19%, peaking at 6.19% in the penultimate week. Despite the fluctuations, there was a slight upward trend in the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia towards the end of the 20-week period. The number of deaths attributed to influenza remained relatively low, with a maximum of 19 deaths in the last week, whereas pneumonia deaths showed more variability, with a high of 3208 in the final week. This data suggests that while influenza is currently a minor contributor to mortality, pneumonia remains a significant and variable concern that could impact healthcare resource allocation.
