Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a gradual decrease in temperature during the earlier part of the day, followed by a significant increase in the afternoon hours, which suggests a typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels started high but showed a marked decrease as the day progressed, indicating a transition to drier air conditions which could have been due to the influence of a high-pressure system. Speaking of pressure, air pressure showed a steady increase throughout the day, which is often associated with stable weather conditions and clearer skies. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with no significant gusts or strong wind events reported. The wind direction was variable throughout the day, with a notable shift from northerly to southerly directions, which may have contributed to the changes in temperature and humidity levels observed.
