Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, peaking during the later hours, which indicates a warming trend. Humidity levels started at saturation but showed significant fluctuation throughout the period, eventually decreasing sharply, which could suggest the dissipation of earlier fog or mist. Air pressure decreased initially, suggesting the possible approach of a weather system, but later increased, which typically signals improving weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate but exhibited a notable spike, implying a brief period of gusty conditions. The wind direction varied, with a notable shift towards a northerly component towards the end of the period, which might have contributed to the drop in humidity and a clearing of the skies.
