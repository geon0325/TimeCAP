Humidity levels showed significant variability earlier in the day but stabilized at a lower level in the latter half, which may have contributed to more comfortable conditions for residents. Air pressure has been steadily increasing, which is often associated with the approach of a high-pressure system that could lead to clearer skies and calmer weather.

The predominant wind direction has been from the west and northwest, which is typical for bringing cooler air into the region, aligning with the observed temperature decrease.
