Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a slight decrease in temperature, indicating a cooling trend. Humidity levels fluctuated but generally remained high, suggesting a muggy atmosphere. A significant drop in air pressure was observed, which could be indicative of an approaching weather system that may lead to instability and potential precipitation. Wind speeds were moderately variable, with some hours experiencing higher gusts, while wind directions were predominantly from the northeast, shifting occasionally to other directions.
