Over the last 20 weeks, the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data indicates a steady increase in the ratio of ILI patients, recently surpassing the baseline threshold that defines an elevated influenza situation. The age group of 0-4 years has shown a consistent rise in ILI cases, which may indicate a higher vulnerability or a greater tendency for transmission within this demographic. Adolescents and young adults (ages 5-24) also experienced a significant increase in ILI cases, suggesting that schools and colleges could be important settings for the spread of influenza. While the older age groups (ages 25 and above) have demonstrated increases in ILI cases as well, their proportions remain lower compared to younger age groups. This trend of rising ILI rates, particularly among children and young adults, could place a strain on pediatric healthcare services and may necessitate targeted public health interventions to manage the spread of influenza effectively.
