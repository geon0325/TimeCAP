Over the past 24 hours in New York City, temperatures exhibited a typical diurnal pattern, rising throughout the day to reach peak warmth in the late afternoon before gradually cooling off during the night. Relative humidity levels fluctuated significantly, dropping during the warmest part of the day but spiking in the cooler night and early morning hours, indicating a possible increase in the comfort level or perception of mugginess. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight variation that could suggest a stable weather pattern without the immediate likelihood of significant weather disturbances. Wind speeds varied moderately, with some hours experiencing calmer conditions and others showing slightly brisker winds, which, when combined with varied wind directions, suggest the presence of shifting local winds rather than the influence of a larger weather system. The wind direction was predominantly from the south to south-east, with an occasional shift, including a brief period with winds from the north, which could introduce cooler air into the region.
