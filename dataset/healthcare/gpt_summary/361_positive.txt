Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant fluctuation in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with an upward trend peaking at weeks 13 and 14 (25.81% and 26.27% respectively) before a gradual decline to below the average (6.26%) by week 20 (2.94%). The majority of positive cases are attributed to Influenza A, which mirrors the overall trend with a peak at weeks 13 and 14 (25.46% and 26.15%) and a decrease thereafter. Despite the overall decline in positive cases towards the end of the 20-week period, the proportion of Influenza B cases has remained relatively stable and even showed a slight increase as a percentage of total positives by week 20 (0.15%). The healthcare system experienced a significant demand during the peak weeks, potentially straining resources and impacting patient care. The current downward trend in positive tests suggests a possible easing of the healthcare burden, but continued surveillance is necessary to manage and respond to potential future surges.
