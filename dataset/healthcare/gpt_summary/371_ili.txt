Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a steady increase in the number of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases across all age groups, with a peak observed in the recent weeks before a slight decline. The highest incidence rates of ILI were found in the younger populations, particularly children aged 0-4 and individuals aged 5-24, which may indicate higher transmission rates or increased susceptibility within these age groups. Despite this increase, the overall ratio of ILI patients remained below the baseline of 2.9%, suggesting that while the number of ILI cases is rising, it has not reached a level considered to be above normal expectations. However, the upward trend in ILI cases could place additional strain on healthcare resources, necessitating a close monitoring of the situation to ensure adequate preparedness for potential spikes in demand for medical care. The recent decline in ILI ratios across all age groups could signal the beginning of a down-trend, but vigilance is necessary to determine if this is a sustained pattern or a temporary fluctuation.
