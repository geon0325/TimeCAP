Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperatures with a general trend of cooling during the early hours and warming as the day progressed. Humidity levels were quite variable, with a peak that suggests the possibility of fog or precipitation, particularly when humidity reached saturation. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with only minor fluctuations that are not indicative of significant weather events. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with a prevailing wind direction from the south to southwest, which is typical for this region and could contribute to the transport of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. A notable shift in wind direction to due north occurred briefly, potentially signaling a transient weather front or local circulation changes.
