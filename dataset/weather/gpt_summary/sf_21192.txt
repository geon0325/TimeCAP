Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have exhibited a mild fluctuation, with a general cooling trend during the earlier hours which later reversed towards the end of the period. Humidity levels were high, reaching saturation at several points through the night and early morning, which could have led to foggy conditions, affecting visibility. Air pressure has been steadily increasing, indicative of stable weather conditions and possibly clearer skies following the dissipation of any morning fog. Wind speeds have remained light throughout the period, suggesting a calm weather pattern with no significant wind-related impacts. The wind direction showed variability, but with no dominant direction, it is unlikely to have influenced the weather significantly.
