Over the last 24 hours in Houston, there has been a notable increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before gradually decreasing towards the evening. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, with a marked increase during the early morning hours, likely contributing to a feeling of mugginess, before decreasing as temperatures rose and then stabilizing towards the evening. Air pressure experienced minor variations but demonstrated a slight overall decrease, which could be indicative of a changing weather system moving into the area. Wind speeds were generally moderate but showed some increase during the day, which may have provided some relief from the higher temperatures. The wind direction was predominantly from the south to southeast, which is typical for Houston and can bring increased moisture and warmth from the Gulf of Mexico.
