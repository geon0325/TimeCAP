Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable decrease in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the ratio of positive specimens declining from a peak of 26.24% in the second week to 2.08% in the latest week. The number of specimens tested has also decreased over this period, with initial counts at 53,289 and dropping to 9,132. The reduction in positive cases is primarily due to a significant decrease in Influenza A detections, which fell from 25.36% to just 1.02%. While Influenza B also showed a decrease, it maintained a more stable presence relative to Influenza A, suggesting different epidemiological patterns for the two viruses. This overall trend of declining influenza activity may lead to decreased hospitalization rates and a lower burden on healthcare resources, but continuous monitoring is essential to prepare for potential future outbreaks.
