Over the last 24 hours in New York City, temperatures have seen a slight upward trend, indicating a moderate increase in warmth throughout the day. Humidity levels have varied significantly, starting at moderate levels before rising sharply, which suggests the potential for fog or heavier moisture in the air, especially when the humidity reached saturation towards the end of the period. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with only minor fluctuations, maintaining conditions that are indicative of settled weather. Wind speeds have been mostly light to gentle, with a period of calm conditions, but increased towards the end of the 24-hour period, which could lead to a brisker feeling in the air and potentially impact activities sensitive to wind. The wind direction has shifted considerably, starting from westerly, calming to variable directions, and then gradually shifting to predominantly northeasterly, which may influence the city's weather pattern, possibly bringing cooler air from the ocean.
