Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, with a marked increase from the baseline average of 7.84%. The data shows a sharp rise in the ratio starting from week 8, peaking at weeks 9 and 10 with ratios of 14.40% and 15.78% respectively, which are nearly double the average. This peak correlates with a significant increase in the total number of deaths reaching a high of 78,946 in week 10. Following this peak, there has been a general decline in the ratio, although it remained above the baseline for the subsequent 10 weeks. The recent trend indicates a decrease towards the average, with the last observed ratio at 7.55%, which suggests that the mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia is beginning to stabilize, but continuous monitoring is essential for early detection of any potential resurgence.
