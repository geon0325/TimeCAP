Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual rise in temperature followed by a slight cooling trend towards the current time, which is typical of the diurnal temperature cycle. Relative humidity levels varied significantly, peaking during the cooler early morning hours and dropping sharply as temperatures increased, indicative of the inverse relationship between temperature and humidity. Air pressure remained relatively stable but showed a slight overall decrease, suggesting a possible weakening of the high-pressure system over the region. Wind speeds were generally light, with some variability, and predominantly originated from the north, shifting towards the south-southwest in the most recent hours, which could signal an approaching change in weather patterns. Wind direction fluctuations hint at the passage of a frontal system or varying local pressure gradients affecting the area.
