Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a fluctuating but overall increasing trend in the proportion of deaths attributed to influenza and pneumonia, starting at 7.03% and peaking at 16.83% before dropping to 8.10% in the most recent week. This peak significantly exceeds the 20-week average mortality ratio of 7.84% for these conditions. There was a notable uptick in pneumonia-related deaths during this period, contributing to the rise in the combined mortality rate, with deaths from pneumonia peaking concurrently with the combined rate in week 15. Influenza-related deaths remained relatively low in comparison but increased slightly towards the latter weeks. These trends suggest an increased burden on healthcare resources dedicated to respiratory illnesses, warranting closer monitoring and potentially increased healthcare provisions to manage further escalations.
