Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable increase in the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, starting at 5.48% and rising to 7.46%, which exceeds the average ratio of 7.84%. The total number of deaths fluctuated but showed an overall upward trend, peaking at 61090 deaths before slightly decreasing to 58206 deaths in the last reported week. Deaths from influenza saw a significant rise, especially in the latter weeks, with a surge from 6 to 246 deaths, indicating a potential outbreak or seasonal increase. Pneumonia-related mortality also increased, with deaths rising from 2749 to 4098. This trend suggests a growing impact of respiratory illnesses on public health, which may require increased healthcare resources and could indicate a need for heightened surveillance and preventive measures.
