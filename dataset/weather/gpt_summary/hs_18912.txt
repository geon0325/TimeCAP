Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has exhibited a gradual increase, indicating a warming trend that may lead to warmer conditions in the short term. Humidity levels have shown a slight decrease after a peak in the early morning hours, suggesting a lessening of potential for precipitation and possibly more comfortable conditions. Air pressure has been slowly decreasing, which could be indicative of an approaching weather system that may alter current conditions. Wind speeds have been relatively steady but have shown a slight increase in the last few hours, pointing to an increase in wind activity that could influence wind chill factors and dispersion of any present atmospheric pollutants. The wind direction has been predominantly from the south-southeast, which is typical for Houston and may contribute to the transport of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, affecting local humidity and precipitation patterns.
