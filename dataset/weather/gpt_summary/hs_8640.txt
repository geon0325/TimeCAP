Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has shown a typical diurnal cycle with a slight increase in the late afternoon, indicative of warm and possibly stable atmospheric conditions. Humidity levels have experienced fluctuations, peaking during the early morning hours, which is common due to nighttime cooling and could have resulted in morning fog or dew. Air pressure has been relatively stable with minor variations, suggesting a lack of significant weather fronts moving through the area during this period. Wind speeds have been mostly light to moderate, with occasional higher gusts in the afternoon, which could have provided some relief from the warmth. The wind direction has been predominantly from the south-southeast, which is typical for Houston and generally brings in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, potentially contributing to the higher humidity levels observed.
