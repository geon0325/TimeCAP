Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have shown a slight fluctuating trend, overall experiencing a gentle rise that peaked during the latter part of the period, indicating a warming pattern. Humidity levels experienced a significant drop, suggesting a transition to drier conditions as the day progressed. Air pressure readings were relatively stable, with a notable increase towards the end of the period, which could signal the arrival of a high-pressure system potentially leading to clearer skies. Wind speeds were mostly consistent with gentle to moderate breezes, while wind direction varied from primarily northerly to a sharp turn to the south, which could be associated with the passage of a frontal system. These changes in wind direction, along with the observed pressure increase and humidity decrease, suggest that the weather in Houston may be undergoing a transition, possibly leading to more settled conditions in the near term.
