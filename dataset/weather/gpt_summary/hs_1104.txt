Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a notable fluctuation in temperature, with a significant drop during the early hours, followed by a gradual increase throughout the day. Correspondingly, humidity levels rose sharply as temperatures fell, indicating the presence of moisture in the cooler early hours, but as temperatures climbed, humidity decreased, suggesting drier conditions during warmer periods. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight increase midday, which could be associated with the stabilizing weather conditions. Wind speeds varied moderately and increased during the day, which might have contributed to the dispersal of humidity, enhancing the drier conditions later on. Wind direction was predominantly from the northeast, with slight variations, which is typical for stable weather patterns in the region.
