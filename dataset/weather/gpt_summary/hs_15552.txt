Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature, with a general trend of warming during the day followed by a slight cooling off at night. Humidity levels were high, particularly during the early morning hours when they reached saturation, suggesting the presence of fog or heavy dew, which likely cleared as the day progressed and humidity decreased. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable but showed a slight decrease towards the end of the period, which could indicate an approaching weather system. Wind speeds varied from calm to moderate throughout the day, with a significant shift in direction from predominantly southerly to a more westerly and then northerly flow. The combination of high humidity, changing air pressure, and variable winds could lead to unpredictable weather patterns, including the possibility of thunderstorms or changing weather fronts.
