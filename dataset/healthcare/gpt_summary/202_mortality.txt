Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia to total deaths has exhibited a notable fluctuation, with a significant peak occurring mid-period where the ratio surged to 19.37% and 19.40%, significantly above the 20-week average of 7.84%. This spike coincides with an absolute increase in total deaths, reaching a maximum of 87,232 in the 8th week, suggesting a potential outbreak or seasonal surge. Following this peak, there has been a consistent decline in both the absolute number of deaths attributed to Influenza or Pneumonia and their ratio to total deaths, ending the period at a ratio of 8.16%, which is still higher than the average. The number of deaths from influenza specifically remained relatively low compared to pneumonia, with a slight increase observed in the middle of the period before returning to lower levels. This trend may indicate a subsiding of the outbreak or effective interventions but warrants ongoing surveillance to manage healthcare resource allocation and prevent future surges.
