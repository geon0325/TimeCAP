Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with a slight downward trend, closing lower by 3.69% from 4027.26 to 3878.44, which may indicate increased investor caution or potential concerns about economic growth. The VIX, commonly referred to as the "fear index," has fluctuated but ended slightly lower at 20.07, suggesting that while market volatility remains, investor anxiety has not escalated significantly. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 have also experienced declines, with a notable drop of 6.19%, signaling potential worries in global markets that could affect worldwide investment sentiment. Gold futures remained relatively stable, closing at the same price as 20 days prior, which often reflects its status as a safe-haven asset during times of market uncertainty. Meanwhile, the depreciation of the USD against the JYP by 6.56% could indicate a shift in currency strength dynamics, potentially impacting international trade and cross-border investment flows.
