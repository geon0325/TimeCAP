Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in mortality due to Influenza or Pneumonia compared to total deaths, with the ratio peaking at 15.78% in week 6â€”more than double the average ratio of 7.84%. Although the ratio decreased subsequently, it remained consistently above the 20-week average until week 13. The absolute number of deaths from both Influenza and Pneumonia has declined since week 6, with Influenza deaths dropping significantly from 634 to 13, and Pneumonia deaths decreasing from 11988 to 6182 in the corresponding period. However, in the most recent week, there has been a slight increase in the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia to 9.83%, coupled with an uptick in the number of deaths from both conditions, suggesting a potential reversal of the declining trend. This volatility in mortality rates could indicate seasonal patterns or variability in the spread of these illnesses, which may require healthcare systems to remain adaptable in managing resources and preventative measures.
