Over the past 24 hours in New York City, there has been a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before beginning to decrease slightly towards the evening. Relative humidity levels experienced significant fluctuations; however, they trended higher during the early hours and late evening, which is typical as temperatures tend to be lower at these times. Air pressure has been decreasing gradually throughout the period, suggesting the potential for changing weather patterns or the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds remained generally light to moderate but increased towards the end of the period, possibly indicating the onset of more dynamic weather conditions. The wind direction was variable but predominantly from the south to southeast, which often brings warmer air masses to the region.
