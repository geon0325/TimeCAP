Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have seen a mild fluctuation, beginning with slightly warmer conditions before gradually cooling and then warming again towards the current hour. Humidity levels have largely been high, especially during the cooler early morning hours, which may have contributed to a feeling of dampness or potential fog development. The air pressure has remained relatively steady, with only a slight decrease recently, indicating stable weather conditions without significant frontal activity. Wind speeds have generally been moderate, but there were periods of calmer winds, especially during the afternoon hours, which could have reduced the dispersal of any fog or low clouds. The prevailing wind direction has been predominantly westerly, which is typical for San Francisco and can influence coastal fog and temperature moderation due to oceanic influence.
