Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a slight decrease in temperature, reaching its lowest point towards the middle of the period before slightly warming again. Humidity levels remained extraordinarily high throughout, consistently at or near saturation, which could indicate a persistent fog or mist over the city, typical for this region. Air pressure showed a gradual and consistent increase, suggesting an improving weather system moving into the area. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a noticeable increase in the latter part of the period, possibly leading to some dispersion of the high humidity levels. The wind direction shifted significantly from southerly to northwesterly, which is often associated with the movement of weather fronts and could be responsible for the change in air pressure and the clearing of skies.
