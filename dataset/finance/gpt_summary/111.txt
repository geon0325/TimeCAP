Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a general uptrend, increasing from 2879.84 to 2993.07, signaling a positive market sentiment. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, has inversely trended downwards from 15.91 to 13.03, which corroborates the stability and investor confidence reflected in the rising S&P 500. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have demonstrated a mix of fluctuations, but both ended the period slightly higher, indicating modest global market gains. Gold futures exhibited volatility with a sharp increase mid-period, suggesting a temporary flight to safety or hedge against potential market risks, but ended the period slightly higher at 1410.10. Crude Oil futures saw a more pronounced increase from 51.14 to 60.43, which could signal rising energy costs that may affect inflation and consumer spending, while currency exchange rates remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations against the USD.
