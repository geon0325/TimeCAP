Over the past 24 hours in New York City, there has been a slight increase in temperature indicating a modest warming trend throughout the day, which peaked in the late afternoon before gradually cooling down. Humidity levels varied significantly, starting at moderate levels, escalating to saturation during the night, and then decreasing sharply, suggesting the passage of a weather front. Air pressure experienced a substantial rise in the early hours, which stabilized later on, indicating the likely arrival of a high-pressure system that could lead to clearer conditions. Wind speeds were mostly light to gentle, with a notable spike at one point, which could suggest a transient gusty event. The wind direction was variable, predominantly from the north-west, with occasional shifts, reflecting typical variability associated with passing weather systems.
