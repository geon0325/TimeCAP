The time-series data on Influenza-like Illness (ILI) over the last 20 weeks indicates a declining trend in the ratio of ILI patients, starting from a peak well above the baseline and eventually falling below it. The age groups of 0-4 and 5-24 show a significant decrease in the number of ILI patients, suggesting a reduction in transmission among children and young adults, which are groups typically associated with higher rates of ILI spread. Notably, the age groups of 25-49 and 50-64 started with a higher number of ILI cases, which could be indicative of more severe illness or greater susceptibility in these populations. The substantial decrease in ILI cases across all age groups is a positive sign for the healthcare system, potentially leading to reduced hospitalizations and a lower burden on healthcare resources. However, a steady or rising trend in ILI case ratios in recent weeks warrants continued monitoring to anticipate and manage potential increases in healthcare demand.
