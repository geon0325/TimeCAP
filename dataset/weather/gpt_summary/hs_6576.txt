Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, with a noticeable peak during the latter part of the series, suggesting a typical diurnal temperature variation with warmer conditions prevailing in the afternoon. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, with very high values during the cooler night and early morning hours, which likely contributed to a muggy feeling before dropping significantly as temperatures rose, indicating drier conditions during peak daytime heating. Air pressure remained relatively stable, though there was a slight trend of decreasing pressure, which could suggest a minor weather system moving through the area or a change in the larger atmospheric pattern. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a few instances of higher gusts, possibly contributing to the dispersion of humidity and affecting the thermal comfort level. The wind direction varied widely throughout the day, indicating the presence of shifting weather patterns that could influence local weather conditions, such as cloud cover and precipitation events.
