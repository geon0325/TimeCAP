Over the past 20 weeks, the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data has shown a significant increase in cases across all age groups, with the highest burden observed in the 5-24 year age group. The proportion of ILI cases exceeded the threshold of 2.9% from week 5 onwards, peaking at 7.37% in week 10, indicating a period of particularly high influenza activity. Although the overall percentage of ILI cases has since decreased, it remains above the 2.9% benchmark, suggesting continued strain on the healthcare system. Notably, the younger population (ages 0-24) consistently contributed the most to the ILI percentages, which could imply a greater need for pediatric and young adult medical resources. The sustained elevation of ILI rates above the threshold for 15 consecutive weeks highlights the need for ongoing vigilance, resource allocation, and public health measures to manage and mitigate the impact of influenza on public health.
