Over the last 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have experienced a fluctuating pattern, showing a warming trend during the day, reaching a peak, and then cooling slightly towards the end of the 24-hour period. Humidity levels have shown significant variation, with notably higher humidity in the early hours, which then decreased as temperatures peaked, suggesting a correlation between temperature and moisture in the air. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, indicating no major weather fronts moving through the area during the observed time frame. Wind speeds varied, with calmer conditions during the early morning hours and a gradual increase through the day, which could contribute to changes in perceived temperature and humidity. The wind direction was predominantly from the south to the southwest, which is typical for Houston and could be associated with the transportation of warmer air masses into the region.
