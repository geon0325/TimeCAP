Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates an escalating trend in the number of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the peak ratio of positive tests reaching 23.65% in week 12, followed by a gradual decline to 8.12% by week 20. Influenza A has been the dominant strain, peaking at 18.16% positivity rate, but its prevalence has decreased more significantly in recent weeks compared to Influenza B, which peaked at a lower rate of 5.49% but demonstrated a slower decline, suggesting a persistent circulation. The overall ratio of positive specimens has consistently exceeded the average ratio of 6.26%, indicating a heightened level of influenza activity during the period analyzed. This trend has likely placed an increased demand on healthcare resources, including diagnostics, treatment, and hospital bed occupancy. Public health responses such as vaccination campaigns and antiviral strategies remain critical to control the spread and mitigate the impact of both strains on the healthcare system.
