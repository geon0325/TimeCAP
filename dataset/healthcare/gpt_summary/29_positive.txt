Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a general decline in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a notable decrease from a peak of 10.26% in week 1 to 1.46% in week 20. Despite this trend, there was a slight uptick in the positive rates for both Influenza A and B around week 18, with Influenza A increasing from 0.45% to 1.10% and Influenza B rising from 0.35% to 0.58% before slightly declining again. The ratio of positive specimens for Influenza B has consistently been higher than for Influenza A, suggesting that Influenza B has been more prevalent during this period. The overall downward trend in positive specimens indicates a reduction in the spread or intensity of influenza, which could potentially ease the burden on healthcare resources if sustained. However, healthcare systems should remain vigilant for any signs of resurgence, as evidenced by the brief increases in positive rates, and ensure adequate preparedness for testing and vaccination efforts.
