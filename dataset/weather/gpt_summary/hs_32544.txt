Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature during the day, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before slightly cooling off towards the evening. Humidity levels showed a decreasing trend as temperatures rose, indicating a typical diurnal pattern where the relative humidity falls as the day becomes warmer. Consistent air pressure throughout the day with minor fluctuations suggests stable atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds remained low to moderate, with a notable increase toward the latter part of the period, while the wind direction shifted from westerly to easterly and then to southeasterly, possibly indicating the approach of a different weather system or a sea breeze effect in the evening. Overall, the weather in Houston has been relatively stable, but the shift in wind direction and the increase in wind speed could signal changing conditions in the near future.
