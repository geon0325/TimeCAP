Over the past 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a general uptrend with intermittent volatility, closing higher at 4117.86 from an opening of 3969.61, which may indicate a cautiously optimistic sentiment among investors. The VIX, or Volatility Index, has remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, ending slightly lower at 19.63 compared to the starting point of 21.09, suggesting that while there is some uncertainty, it hasn't led to extreme market swings. International markets reflected by the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 have also demonstrated an upward movement, with the Nikkei 225 closing at 27606.46 from an opening of 26446.00, and the FTSE 100 marginally increasing to finish at 7885.20 from 7725.00, indicating positive sentiment in key global markets. Commodity prices for Gold Futures showed mild volatility but maintained a relatively stable price range, ending at 1877.40 compared to the starting price of 1874.60, which could suggest a steady demand for safe-haven assets amidst global uncertainties. Meanwhile, Crude Oil Futures experienced a downward trend, closing at 78.47 from an opening of 77.41, and currency markets saw the EUR/USD and USD/JYP exchange rates ending almost at the same levels where they started, while the USD/CNY pair saw a slight depreciation of the USD, which could point to shifting dynamics in trade and currency valuation.
