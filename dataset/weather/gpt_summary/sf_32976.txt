Over the past day in San Francisco, there was a noticeable cooling trend in temperatures that reached its lowest point in the early hours of the morning before gradually warming up throughout the day. Humidity levels fluctuated moderately but were generally high, suggesting a potential for fog or mist, especially when temperatures were at their lowest. Air pressure remained relatively stable for much of the day, indicating steady weather conditions, but experienced a significant drop towards the end of the period, which could signal an approaching change in weather patterns, such as the onset of a front. Wind speeds varied, with periods of calmer winds interspersed with a few gustier hours, and the wind direction shifted predominantly from westerly to northerly. The combination of these factors, including the drop in air pressure and increasing wind speeds, suggests that residents and visitors should prepare for a changeable weather situation, possibly becoming more unsettled or windy.
