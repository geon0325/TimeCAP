The humidity levels have shown a decreasing trend which could suggest the presence of a drier air mass moving into the area. Air pressure has been steadily increasing, which is often associated with the approach of a high-pressure system, potentially leading to clearer skies and calmer weather conditions. Wind speeds have remained relatively light with minor fluctuations, suggesting stable weather conditions without significant storm activity. The wind direction has been variable but predominantly from the north, which is typical of cooler, stable air being transported into the region.
