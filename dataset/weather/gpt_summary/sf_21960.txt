Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a slight decrease in temperature, indicating a mild cooling trend. Humidity levels have been high, reaching saturation at certain points, which suggests an increased likelihood of fog or mist, particularly during the early morning or late evening hours. Air pressure has remained relatively stable, with a minor downward trend, which generally does not indicate a significant change in the current weather pattern. Wind speeds have been moderate, with a slight decrease observed, while wind direction has shown variability, shifting from predominantly westerly to more varied directions including some southerly components. This combination of high humidity, stable air pressure, and variable winds could lead to persistent cloud cover and possibly damp conditions.
