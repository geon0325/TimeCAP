Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, which later stabilized and saw a slight increase towards the latter part of the period. The humidity levels exhibited significant fluctuations, with relatively high levels during the cooler early hours and a notable drop as temperatures rose, suggesting a possible passage of a front or dry air intrusion. Air pressure gradually increased throughout the day, indicating a potential high-pressure system moving into the area, which is often associated with clearer and more stable weather conditions. Wind speeds varied, with some gustier conditions observed, but generally remained moderate. The wind direction shifted from southerly to northerly and then predominantly easterly, which could be associated with the movement of weather systems across the region and may have influenced the observed temperature and humidity changes.
