Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual decline in temperature, culminating in a significant drop towards the later hours, suggestive of a potential cold front passage. Humidity levels have shown considerable fluctuations, with a notable spike to saturation during the temperature's sharpest decline, indicating the presence of dense moisture in the air, likely leading to fog or heavy dew. Air pressure has been generally rising, indicative of a strengthening high-pressure system that could result in clearing skies and more stable weather conditions following any precipitation. Wind speeds have been mostly light to moderate, with occasional higher gusts, and wind direction has been variable, with a shift to a northerly component coinciding with the colder temperatures, reinforcing the possibility of a cold front. Overall, the weather in Houston has been dynamic, with a trend towards cooler and possibly clearer conditions as the high-pressure system asserts itself.
