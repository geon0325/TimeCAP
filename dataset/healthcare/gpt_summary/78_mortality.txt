Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable increase in the proportion of deaths attributable to influenza or pneumonia, rising from an initial 5.38% to 6.26%, which surpasses the 20-week average ratio of mortality from these causes at 7.84%. This upward trend is concerning as it suggests a growing impact of these respiratory conditions on overall mortality. The total number of deaths has also increased during this period, from 51,684 to 53,771, indicating a general rise in mortality which, coupled with the increase in influenza and pneumonia deaths, could strain healthcare resources. The number of deaths specifically from influenza has seen a marked increase in the latter weeks, jumping from single digits to 50 deaths in the final week. Given the observed trends, it is imperative for healthcare systems to bolster their preparedness for managing respiratory illnesses, and potentially consider public health interventions to mitigate the spread of these diseases.
