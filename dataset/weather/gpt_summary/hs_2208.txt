Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, indicating a cooling trend that moved from mild to cooler conditions. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly but ended in a drier state compared to the start of the period, suggesting a decrease in moisture in the air. Air pressure showed a general increase through the period, which is typically associated with stable weather conditions and could indicate fairer weather ahead. Wind speed varied, with periods of calmer winds followed by stronger gusts, but overall maintained moderate intensities, which might have contributed to the dispersion of humidity and a slight cooling effect. The wind direction was variable, starting with southerly winds and shifting towards a northerly direction, which is often associated with the transport of cooler air masses that could be responsible for the observed decrease in temperatures.
