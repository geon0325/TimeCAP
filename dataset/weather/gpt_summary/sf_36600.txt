Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature, with a general trend of cooling followed by a moderate warming period towards the end of the observed time frame. Humidity levels remained high throughout the day, with a peak in the early hours, which could have contributed to a perception of chillier weather despite the actual temperatures. Air pressure showed minor variations, though there was a slight decreasing trend, indicating the possibility of changing weather patterns or the approach of a new weather system. Wind speeds varied, with periods of stronger winds interspersed with calmer conditions, while the wind direction shifted predominantly from westerly to northerly components with occasional variability. These conditions, characterized by relatively high humidity, changing air pressure, and variable winds, suggest an unsettled weather pattern that could lead to the development of coastal fog or mist, a common occurrence in San Francisco's microclimate.
