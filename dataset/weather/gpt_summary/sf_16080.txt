Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature, with a general cooling trend overnight that transitioned to warming during the daytime. Humidity levels were notably high, reaching saturation at times, which could have led to foggy conditions, particularly when combined with the stable air pressure system in place throughout the day. There was a significant drop in air pressure in the later hours, suggesting the possible approach of a weather system that could bring changes to the current conditions. Wind speeds remained relatively light and variable, with some shifts in direction that included a notable change to a more northerly and westerly flow. Overall, the stable wind and high humidity, along with the pressure changes, could indicate the potential for cloud formation or fog, impacting visibility and possibly leading to cooler temperatures.
