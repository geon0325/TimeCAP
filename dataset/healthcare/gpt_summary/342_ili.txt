Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a gradual increase in the ratio of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) patients, with recent weeks showing a notable upward trend that has surpassed the baseline threshold used to determine a significant influenza situation. The age groups contributing most to the rise in ILI cases appear to be those between 5-24 and 0-4, suggesting that school-aged children and preschoolers are currently the most affected demographics. The least impact is observed in the elderly population aged 65 or more, although there is still a slight increase in ILI cases within this age group. The consistent rise in the ILI ratio over time suggests an ongoing spread of influenza, which could lead to increased healthcare utilization and the potential for strain on healthcare resources. Public health interventions focused on the most affected age groups and monitoring for further increases in ILI presentations will be essential to manage the healthcare system's response to the evolving situation.
