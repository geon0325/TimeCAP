Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have experienced a mild fluctuation, with a general trend of cooling during the early hours followed by a gradual increase as the day progressed. Humidity levels have shown significant variation, with notable drops and spikes, suggesting the presence of alternating atmospheric conditions that could affect local comfort levels and possibly lead to the formation of fog, especially in coastal areas. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout most of the day, with a sharp decline in the most recent hours, indicating a possible change in weather patterns such as the approach of a weather front that could lead to precipitation or wind changes. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with brief periods of calm conditions, and the wind direction shifted throughout the day, which is characteristic of the variable coastal winds in this region. This combination of weather indicators suggests a dynamic weather situation in San Francisco that could lead to changing conditions in the short term.
