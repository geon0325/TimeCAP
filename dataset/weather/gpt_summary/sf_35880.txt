Over the past day in San Francisco, the temperature experienced a typical diurnal cycle with a gradual decrease from late evening into the early morning hours, reaching its lowest point just before sunrise, followed by a steady increase as the day progressed. Humidity levels varied significantly, with lower values during the warmer daytime hours and higher values at night, indicating the presence of moisture that could lead to morning fog, a common occurrence in the region. The air pressure remained relatively stable, indicating a period of steady weather without significant frontal activity. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with an increase noted in the late afternoon and early evening, which is characteristic of the sea breeze effect along coastal areas. The wind direction was predominantly from the west and northwest, which is typical for San Francisco's climate and suggests the influence of the Pacific Ocean on local weather patterns.
