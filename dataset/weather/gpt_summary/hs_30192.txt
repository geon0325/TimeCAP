Over the past day, the temperature in Houston exhibited a diurnal pattern, starting off warmer in the early hours, cooling towards the early morning, and then gradually increasing again to reach the peak in the late afternoon. Humidity levels showed an inverse relationship to temperature, with the highest humidity occurring during the coolest part of the morning and decreasing as temperatures rose. Air pressure experienced minor fluctuations but notably increased in the latest hour, potentially indicating a change in the weather system. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, peaking in the middle of the day, which could have contributed to the dispersal of humidity. The prevailing wind direction was southerly to southwesterly, shifting more westerly in the latest hour, aligning with the increase in air pressure and suggesting the possible approach of a weather front.
