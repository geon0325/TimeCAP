Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature exhibited a typical diurnal pattern, peaking during the afternoon and reaching its lowest point in the early morning, consistent with normal daily fluctuations. Humidity levels were notably high, especially during the nighttime and early morning hours, where they reached saturation, indicative of possible fog or dew formation which could have affected visibility and morning commute conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period with a slight decrease toward the end of the 24-hour period, suggesting a potential change in weather conditions may be approaching. Wind speeds were generally light to gentle, with minimal changes, which would not have significantly influenced the dispersion of pollutants or provided substantial relief from the heat. The wind direction varied but predominantly came from the east to southeast, which in Houston is often associated with warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico, contributing to the high humidity levels experienced.
