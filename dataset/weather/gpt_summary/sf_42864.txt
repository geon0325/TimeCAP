Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have experienced a gradual decrease during the night, followed by a steady increase throughout the day, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels were high, reaching saturation during the early hours, which could have led to the formation of fog or mist, particularly prevalent in coastal areas like San Francisco. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable, with only minor fluctuations, suggesting a period of stable weather without significant front movements or storm systems. Wind speeds were mostly light and variable, which is common in urban settings where buildings can disrupt wind flow. Wind directions shifted throughout the day, but no strong wind pattern was established, possibly due to the influence of local topography and the marine environment.
