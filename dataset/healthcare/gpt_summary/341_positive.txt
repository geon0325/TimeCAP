Over the past 20 weeks, the data indicates a declining trend in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with an average positive ratio of 6.26%. The peak positivity rate occurred in week 1 at 8.84%, with Influenza A accounting for the majority of cases, while the lowest positivity rate was observed in week 19 at 0.48%. The most significant decrease in positive specimens occurred between weeks 7 and 8, with a drop from 4.90% to 3.31%. Influenza B remained a minor proportion of the positive cases throughout the period, never exceeding 0.08% in any given week. This downward trend signifies a decrease in influenza cases, which could alleviate some of the burden on the healthcare system, but continuous monitoring is essential to prepare for possible future outbreaks.
