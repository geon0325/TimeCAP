Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable increase in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the average ratio of positive specimens at 6.26%. The data shows a significant upward trend in both Influenza A and B positivity rates, with a peak in the ratio of positive specimens at 24.73% in week 19, dominated by Influenza A, which reached a peak positivity rate of 20.21% in week 17. In contrast, Influenza B showed a delayed peak at 6.23% in week 19. The recent decline to 19.77% of positive specimens in week 20 suggests a possible tapering off, but the rates for both Influenza A and B remain substantially above the average, indicating sustained transmission. The observed trends suggest an increased burden on healthcare resources due to influenza and emphasize the need for continued surveillance, vaccination efforts, and preparedness in healthcare settings to manage potential surges in patient volume.
