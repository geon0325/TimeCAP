Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable increase in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a surge from 0.07% in week 1 to 0.55% in week 20, which is significantly above the 20-week average of 0.16%. This upward trend is primarily driven by a sharp rise in Influenza A detections, which soared from 0.01% to 0.49% by the end of the period, suggesting a dominant strain emergence. Conversely, Influenza B has shown a relatively stable positivity rate, fluctuating around the 0.05% mark with a slight increase in the last week. The total number of specimens tested has also increased progressively, reaching a peak of 63,268 in week 20, indicating heightened surveillance or possibly an increase in respiratory illness in the population. The growing prevalence of influenza, particularly Influenza A, could strain healthcare resources, necessitating increased preparedness for a potential influx of patients requiring medical care.
