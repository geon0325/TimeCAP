Over the last 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have shown minor fluctuations, generally maintaining a stable and moderate range. Humidity levels have been high throughout the period, indicating a moist and potentially overcast sky, which may lead to fog in the coastal areas, especially during the early hours. The air pressure has remained relatively steady, with a slight decreasing trend, which is typical for stable weather conditions but could also suggest the distant approach of a weather system. Wind speeds have been very low, suggesting a calm atmosphere with limited wind chill effect and minimal dispersion of airborne particles, which could affect those with respiratory concerns. The wind direction has shifted from northerly to southeasterly over the period, which could bring in different air masses and possibly influence the local temperature and humidity in the coming hours.
