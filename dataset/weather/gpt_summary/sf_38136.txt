Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced relatively stable temperatures with a slight warming trend during the day, which is typical for the region's coastal climate. Humidity levels have varied, reaching saturation at one point, which could have led to foggy conditions, particularly during the early morning hours when temperatures were lowest. Air pressure has shown minor fluctuations, with a general decrease towards the latter part of the period, which may indicate an approaching weather system that could bring changes in the near future. Wind speeds have been mostly moderate but showed a significant increase midday, suggesting the presence of stronger wind events that could affect outdoor activities and marine interests. The predominant wind direction has been southerly, shifting to westerly later on, which is consistent with the passage of a weather front moving through the area.
