Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable decrease in the proportion of deaths due to Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, with the ratio dropping from 13.00% to 8.31%, indicating a downward trend in mortality from these causes. Despite fluctuations, the total number of deaths has also shown a general decline over this period. The number of deaths attributed specifically to Influenza has significantly decreased, from 66 deaths in the first week to 7 in the last week, which could suggest a reduction in Influenza prevalence or effective management strategies. In contrast, deaths from Pneumonia remain a more significant concern, accounting for the majority of deaths within the Influenza/Pneumonia category throughout the 20 weeks, though also following a downward trend. This overall decline in mortality rates from these respiratory conditions could alleviate some pressures on the healthcare system, but continuous monitoring is essential to manage potential future outbreaks and ensure adequate resource allocation.
