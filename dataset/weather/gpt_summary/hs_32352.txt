Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak during the later hours of the day before starting to decline towards the early hours of the next day. Throughout this period, humidity levels were relatively high, especially during the nighttime and early morning, which could have resulted in a muggy feeling for residents. Air pressure remained fairly stable with a slight fluctuation, indicating no significant weather fronts moving through the area during this time frame. Wind speeds were consistently light, suggesting a calm weather pattern, with the wind direction primarily coming from the southeast, shifting slightly throughout the day. The combination of high humidity, stable air pressure, and light winds may have led to a warm and somewhat stagnant air mass over Houston.
