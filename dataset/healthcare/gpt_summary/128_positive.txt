Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable decline in the proportion of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with an initial high of 15.33% dropping to a low of 0.95% by the end of the period. The incidence of Influenza A has shown a decreasing trend, from a peak positivity ratio of 6.05% to a ratio of 0.68% by week 20. Influenza B has followed a similar downward trajectory but started from a higher positivity rate of 9.28% and ended at 0.27%. The overall reduction in positive influenza specimens suggests a declining activity of the virus, which may lead to a decrease in influenza-related healthcare demand. However, the healthcare system should remain vigilant as even low levels of influenza can impact vulnerable populations and the trend can reverse, especially in the context of seasonal variations or new emerging strains.
