Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a general trend of decreasing mortality due to Influenza or Pneumonia in relation to the total number of deaths, with the percentage dropping from a high of 17.01% to a low of 5.81%. Despite fluctuations, the overall trajectory suggests a relative improvement, as the initial weeks saw markedly higher ratios, exceeding the 20-week average of 7.84%, while the latter weeks remained consistently below this average. Notably, the total number of deaths decreased from 79,681 to 57,595, with a corresponding decline in deaths attributed to pneumonia, which fell from 11,815 to 3,512. However, deaths from influenza showed less variability, with numbers remaining relatively stable. This observed trend could indicate either a seasonal pattern in mortality or the impact of healthcare interventions and public health measures, and it may also alleviate some pressure on healthcare resources allocated for these illnesses.
