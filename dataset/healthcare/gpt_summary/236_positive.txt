Over the past 20 weeks, the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza has fluctuated, averaging 6.26%, with a peak positive ratio of 0.38% in week 10 and a low of 0.13% in week 16. The majority of positive cases were for Influenza A, which had its highest positivity ratio of 0.23% in week 10, while Influenza B peaked later at 0.20% in the last week. There is an observed decline in the number of specimens tested from 14,443 in week 1 to 6,443 in week 20, which could potentially mask the actual incidence rate of infection due to reduced surveillance. The generally low and declining positivity rates suggest that influenza is not widespread currently; however, healthcare systems should remain vigilant for any signs of an uptick, especially given the late-season increase in Influenza B cases. It is crucial for public health officials to monitor these trends closely to manage resources effectively and prepare for potential future increases in influenza activity.
