Over the last 20 weeks, the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia to the total number of deaths showed a marked increase, reaching a peak of 10.89% in week 14, significantly higher than the average ratio of 7.84%. This peak coincides with a substantial increase in the number of deaths attributed to Influenza, which spiked to 1626 in the same week. The total number of deaths also saw a notable rise during this period, with a peak of 67,495 in week 12, suggesting a potential strain on healthcare resources. In recent weeks, there has been a slight decline in the ratio of mortality from these respiratory conditions, dropping to 8.44% by week 20, yet it remains above the average. The data indicates a critical period during weeks 11-14, where targeted healthcare interventions might have been necessary to manage the surge in Influenza and Pneumonia related mortality.
