Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, transitioning from mild conditions to a cooler environment, indicative of a typical diurnal pattern. Humidity levels saw a marked increase, reaching a point of complete saturation during the night, which may have led to fog or mist formation, particularly common in coastal cities like San Francisco. Air pressure showed some variability, with a significant increase at one point, suggesting the passage of a transient high-pressure system, which often brings clearer skies and calmer conditions. Wind speeds remained mostly light, with occasional gentle breezes, and wind direction shifted throughout the day, starting from easterly, moving to southerly, and then settling into a more westerly direction, which could influence coastal fog dispersion and temperature regulation. Overall, the weather has been relatively stable, with no extreme conditions reported, which is consistent with San Francisco's maritime climate influence.
