Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a general declining trend in the ratio of mortality due to Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, starting from 8.22% and decreasing to 6.08%, which is below the 20-week average of 7.84%. The total number of deaths fluctuated slightly but showed a moderate decrease over the period, with a peak of 59,038 in the second week and ending at 50,797 in the last week. Deaths from Influenza showed a significant decrease from a high of 605 in the fourth week to just 19 in the final week, indicating a potential reduction in Influenza prevalence or effective management. Pneumonia-related deaths also decreased but less dramatically, from 4,452 in the first week to 3,069 in the twentieth week, suggesting a persistent but improving impact on the healthcare system. This overall decline in mortality rates from these respiratory conditions could indicate successful public health interventions and healthcare responses or seasonal variations in disease prevalence.
