Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature, with a trend towards warming throughout the day, peaking in the late afternoon before gradually cooling down. The humidity levels experienced significant variation, with a period of maximum saturation suggesting the possibility of fog or heavy dew, followed by a sharp decrease, which typically indicates drier air moving into the area. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase towards the evening, indicative of stable weather conditions, though the brief drop in pressure could have been associated with transient weather patterns. Wind speeds were generally light, with some variability in direction, suggesting a lack of strong weather fronts moving through the area during this time frame. The combination of high humidity and light winds overnight could have led to reduced visibility conditions such as fog, especially in areas near bodies of water or low-lying regions.
