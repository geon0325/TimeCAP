The analysis of the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data over the last 20 weeks reveals a fluctuating trend in the incidence of ILI across different age groups, with a noticeable peak in the total number of patients roughly midway through the period, followed by a gradual decrease. Initially, the ratio of ILI patients was significantly above the baseline, indicating a heightened level of influenza activity, but this ratio has since declined to approach the baseline, suggesting a reduction in ILI prevalence. The highest burden of ILI was observed in the age group 25-49 throughout the period, while the lowest was in the youngest age group (0-4 years) after the initial weeks. Despite the overall declining trend in ILI ratios, the consistently high number of ILI cases in the adult age brackets (25-64 years) could continue to strain healthcare resources, necessitating ongoing monitoring and preparedness. The trend towards the baseline suggests that the ILI situation is improving, but healthcare systems should remain vigilant, especially for the most affected age groups, and continue to promote preventive measures.
