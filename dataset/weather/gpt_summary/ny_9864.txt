Over the last 24 hours, New York City experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching a peak in the late afternoon before slightly cooling down in the evening. Humidity levels showed notable fluctuations but ended the period at saturation, indicating the potential for fog or precipitation. Air pressure exhibited a significant drop during the day, which could be associated with the development of a weather system, and then partially recovered, suggesting variable weather conditions. Wind speeds were mostly light to gentle and showed little variation throughout the period. The wind direction was predominantly southwesterly, with a brief shift to northeasterly winds in the early morning hours, before returning to a southwesterly direction, which could influence the transport of air masses into the city.
