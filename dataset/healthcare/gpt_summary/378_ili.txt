Over the last 20 weeks, the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data indicates that there has been a fluctuating but overall decreasing trend in the proportion of ILI cases across all age groups, with the highest ratio of 2.67% observed in week 8 and the lowest at 1.52% in week 19. The ratio of ILI patients has remained consistently below the benchmark of 2.9% for assessing the severity of the influenza situation. The age group 0-4 consistently reported the highest number of ILI cases, suggesting a heightened vulnerability or exposure within this demographic. While the ratios have been decreasing overall, the healthcare system should remain vigilant, particularly in monitoring the youngest age group and being prepared for potential increases in ILI cases, as the ratios are still relatively close to the benchmark. The data suggests a current mild influenza season, but continued surveillance is necessary to detect and respond to any unexpected rise in ILI incidence, which could strain healthcare resources.
