Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with an overall average positivity rate of 6.26%. The data indicates a significant upward trend in Influenza A detections, peaking at 6.17% in week 11, before declining and then rising again to 4.01% in the most recent week. In contrast, Influenza B has maintained a relatively stable and lower positivity rate, with a slight increase to 0.10% in the last week. The peak of total positive specimens occurred in week 11, coinciding with the highest number of specimens tested, suggesting a potential strain on healthcare resources during this period. The recent increase in the positivity rate, particularly for Influenza A, could signal a resurgence of cases requiring vigilant monitoring and potential adjustments in healthcare resource allocation.
