Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the positivity rate of respiratory specimens for influenza, with the overall average ratio being 6.26%. The data indicates an upward trend in the early weeks, reaching a peak positivity rate of 23.65% in week 10, followed by a gradual decline to 5.81% by week 20. Influenza A has been the predominant strain, with its highest positivity rate at 18.16% in week 10, but it has since decreased to 1.79% by week 20. Despite the overall decrease, Influenza B has shown a more stable pattern with a peak of 6.69% in week 16 and a less steep decline to 4.03% by week 20. This trend indicates that while the influenza season may be waning, the healthcare system must continue to monitor and manage influenza activity, particularly for the presence and impact of Influenza B.
