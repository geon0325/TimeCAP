Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable decrease in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for both Influenza A and B, with the total ratio of positive specimens declining from 14.02% to 0.80%. The data indicates a peak in positivity rates at the start of the time series, followed by a consistent downward trend, suggesting that the flu season may have reached its height earlier in the period analyzed. Influenza A showed a more significant reduction in positivity rate compared to Influenza B, dropping from 8.22% to 0.45%, which could imply a faster rate of decline or possible effectiveness in prevention and treatment strategies for this strain. Despite the overall decrease, there was a slight uptick in the positivity rate for Influenza A in the latest week, which may warrant close monitoring for potential resurgence. This declining trend in flu positivity rates could lead to a decrease in the burden on healthcare resources, but vigilance is necessary to manage and respond to the dynamic nature of influenza transmission.
