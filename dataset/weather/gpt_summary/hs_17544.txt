Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have experienced a slight decrease, following a typical diurnal pattern with cooler temperatures in the early morning hours before dawn and a gradual increase after sunrise. Humidity levels remained high throughout the period, indicating a moist air mass in the region that could contribute to a feeling of mugginess and potentially lead to the formation of fog or low clouds, especially during the nighttime and early morning. Air pressure has been steadily increasing, suggesting a trend towards more stable atmospheric conditions, which could lead to clearer skies and less precipitation chances. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate and shifted significantly from southerly to westerly and then northerly directions, reflecting the passage of a weather front that could be responsible for the slight dip in temperatures observed. The combination of these factors points to a relatively stable weather pattern with no immediate indication of severe weather events in the near term for Houston.
