Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have exhibited a typical diurnal pattern, with a noticeable drop during the early morning hours before gradually rising again towards the afternoon. Humidity levels have fluctuated significantly, with periods of very high humidity, especially in the early hours, and much lower levels during the latter part of the period, suggesting variable atmospheric moisture that could have implications for fog formation and visibility. Air pressure has been relatively stable with a slight upward trend, indicating a period of settled weather, though a significant spike was observed mid-period, which could be associated with a transient weather system. Wind speeds have varied, with some stronger gusts that might have influenced wind chill and sea conditions, while wind direction has been predominantly from the west and northwest, with occasional variations, which is typical for the coastal climate of San Francisco. Overall, these conditions suggest a generally mild and typical weather pattern for the region, with the variability in humidity and wind being the most noteworthy features in the last day.
