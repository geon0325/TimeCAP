Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have exhibited a diurnal pattern with a peak during the daytime and a cooling trend overnight. Humidity levels showed fluctuations but remained high throughout the period, suggesting a moist air mass over the area that could lead to a feeling of mugginess or the potential for fog, particularly during the cooler nighttime and early morning hours. Air pressure variations were minimal but did show a slight increase mid-period, which typically indicates stable weather conditions, although the return to previous pressure levels suggests a transient influence. Wind speeds varied significantly, with a period of calm winds followed by a notable increase, and then a decrease towards the current hour, which could influence the dispersion of fog or low-level clouds. Wind direction shifted from predominantly easterly to a more variable pattern with a notable period of westerly winds, which is consistent with the passage of a weather system through the region.
