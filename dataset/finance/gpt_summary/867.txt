Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has experienced volatility with an overall downward trend, closing lower by 46.43 points from 3900.86 to 3854.43, indicating potential unease in the equity market. The VIX, or Volatility Index, has fluctuated, peaking at 34.02 and ending at 26.17, which reflects the observed market swings and suggests a heightened level of investor uncertainty. Internationally, the Nikkei 225 showed a recovery after a dip, closing higher by over 1,000 points, and the FTSE 100 also exhibited resilience, bouncing back from a low of 7016.30 to close at 7196.60, signaling strength in these markets despite global pressures.

Commodity prices saw gold futures dropping from 1871.50 to 1730.00, highlighting a move away from traditional safe-haven assets, while crude oil futures have seen a significant decline from 120.67 to 104.09, which may indicate a shift in energy demand expectations or a reaction to geopolitical events. Currency markets have shown a strengthening of the USD against major currencies with the EUR/USD and USD/JPY pairs closing at 1.02 and 136.30 respectively, suggesting a flight to the perceived safety of the dollar amidst global financial uncertainties.
