Over the last 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, transitioning from cooler to milder conditions. Relative humidity levels showed significant variation, with a peak during the cooler early hours and a notable decrease as temperatures rose, indicating drier conditions during the warmer period. Air pressure decreased steadily throughout the day, suggesting an increased likelihood of changing weather patterns that could lead to potential precipitation or other weather events. Wind speeds were generally light but increased slightly towards the end of the period, with a more pronounced change in wind direction from primarily westerly to a more southerly flow, which could influence the temperature and humidity levels in the coming hours. Overall, the city's weather has been relatively stable, but the decreasing air pressure and shift in wind direction could signal incoming weather changes.
