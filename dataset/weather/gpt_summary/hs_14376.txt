Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature experienced a typical diurnal variation with a gradual increase through the afternoon reaching a peak, followed by a decrease during the night, and again rising towards the end of the period. Humidity levels varied considerably, with very high levels indicating possible saturation during the early morning hours, which could have led to fog or dew; this later dropped significantly in the afternoon as temperatures rose, suggesting drier conditions. Air pressure showed a slight declining trend over the period, which could be indicative of a developing weather system that may affect local conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate and showed some variability, but there were no significant gusts that would indicate stormy conditions. Wind directions were predominantly from the south to southeast, except for a brief period where they shifted dramatically, which could have influenced local weather patterns, such as bringing in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico.
