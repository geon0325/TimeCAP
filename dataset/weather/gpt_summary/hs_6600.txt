Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature reaching its peak in the late afternoon before starting to cool down, consistent with typical diurnal patterns. Humidity levels dropped significantly as temperatures rose, indicating a possible increase in discomfort during the hottest parts of the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight decrease observed, which could suggest a weak weather system moving through the area. Wind speeds were generally light with some variability, and a notable increase in wind speed occurred in the last recorded hour, which could signal a shift in weather patterns. The wind direction varied, predominantly coming from the south and southeast, which is typical for Houston and can contribute to bringing in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico.
