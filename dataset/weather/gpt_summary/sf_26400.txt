Over the last 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a noticeable diurnal pattern in temperature with a rise during the daytime and a drop during the night, which is typical for the region. Relative humidity levels have generally remained high, with a slight decrease around midday, indicating the presence of moisture in the air that could contribute to a feeling of mugginess or potential fog development, especially during the early morning or late evening. The air pressure remained relatively steady throughout most of the period but showed a significant decrease in the latest readings, which could be indicative of an approaching weather system that might lead to changes such as increased wind speeds or precipitation. Wind speeds have been mostly light to moderate but experienced some variability, reducing to near calm conditions at times, which could result in poor dispersion of air pollutants leading to reduced air quality. The wind direction has been predominantly westerly, which is common for San Francisco, with some shifts that suggest the presence of variable local weather patterns or possibly the influence of coastal sea breezes.
