Over the last 20 weeks, respiratory specimens testing for influenza have consistently yielded low positivity rates, averaging 6.26%, with the highest positivity recorded at 0.15% in weeks 14 and 15. Influenza A and B's individual positivity rates have fluctuated slightly but have remained proportionately low, with Influenza A peaking at 0.08% in week 14 and Influenza B at 0.09% in week 15. There has been a general downward trend in positivity rates for both Influenza A and B in the most recent weeks, with the latest data indicating a significant drop to 0.01% for Influenza A and a slight decrease to 0.06% for Influenza B. Despite a steady number of specimens tested weekly, there is no indication of a significant uptick in influenza incidence, suggesting stable or controlled influenza activity within the population. The sustained low positivity rates may indicate effective influenza prevention measures and vaccine efficacy, but continued surveillance is essential to detect and respond to any potential outbreaks.
