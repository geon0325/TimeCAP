Over the last 24 hours in New York City, temperatures exhibited a gradual increase, indicative of an approaching warm front or diurnal heating effects. The relative humidity showed a significant fluctuation, reaching saturation at several points, which could have resulted in foggy conditions or precipitation. Atmospheric pressure experienced a slight overall decrease, suggesting the possibility of an incoming low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, but an increase in the latter part of the period suggests the potential for brisker conditions moving forward. There was a notable shift in wind direction from predominantly northerly to variable directions, including southerly and westerly, which can be associated with changing weather patterns and the movement of weather systems through the area.
