Over the last 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures displayed a typical diurnal pattern with a peak during the day and a drop towards the early hours of the morning. Humidity levels were significantly high, reaching saturation during the night which could have led to foggy conditions, particularly around dawn. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, suggesting steady weather conditions without significant fronts or storms passing through the region. Wind speeds were generally light with little variation, which would not have contributed much to temperature changes or dispelling any fog or low clouds formed due to high humidity levels. The wind direction was predominantly from the southwest, which is common for coastal San Francisco and indicative of the prevailing maritime influence on the city's weather.
