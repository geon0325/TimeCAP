Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a general uptrend, increasing from 3483.34 to 3572.66 despite some volatility, which is mirrored by a decline in the VIX from 26.97 to 23.45, indicating a decrease in market uncertainty and fear. International indices like the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have also experienced upward momentum, with the Nikkei 225 making a significant jump from 23507.23 to 25349.60, and the FTSE 100 recovering from early losses to close higher at 6382.10. Gold Futures have fluctuated, with a notable dip to 1853.20 before a slight recovery to 1860.70, suggesting investors may be shifting towards riskier assets as gold typically serves as a safe haven. Crude Oil Futures have been relatively unstable, with prices dipping to a low of 35.79 before partially rebounding to 41.45, which could indicate concerns over oil demand and supply dynamics amidst global economic recovery efforts. Exchange rates have shown minor fluctuations; the EUR/USD pair remained mostly around the 1.18 level, while the USD/JPY pair saw a decrease from 105.14 to 105.26, and USD/CNY ended the period slightly lower at 6.61, reflecting ongoing currency market adjustments to global economic conditions.
