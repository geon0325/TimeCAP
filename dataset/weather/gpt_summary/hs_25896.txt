Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have generally trended upwards, reaching their peak in the late afternoon before gradually cooling down, typical of the diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels were quite high throughout the period, often reaching saturation, which suggests the potential for fog or dew formation, particularly during the early morning hours when temperatures were cooler. Air pressure remained fairly stable with a slight fluctuation, indicating no immediate signs of significant weather fronts or systems affecting the area. Wind speeds were mostly light to gentle, with some variability in direction, suggesting a relatively calm wind pattern without dominant weather systems influencing the wind flow. The combination of high humidity, stable air pressure, and gentle winds points to a stable but muggy weather pattern, typical for the Houston area, without immediate indications of severe weather events.
