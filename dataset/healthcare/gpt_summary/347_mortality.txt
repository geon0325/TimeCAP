Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia as a percentage of total deaths has shown an upward trend, exceeding the 20-week average of 7.84% in the latter half of the period. The combined deaths from Influenza and Pneumonia peaked in week 18 with a ratio of 9.15%, indicating a significant increase from the starting ratio of 5.63% in week 1. There was a notable surge in deaths attributable to Influenza starting from week 10, with the highest count observed in week 16, suggesting a potential outbreak or increased virulence. Pneumonia-related deaths also rose consistently, contributing to an overall increase in the mortality ratio, which necessitates a heightened healthcare response to manage the impact on hospital capacities and public health. The data suggests the need for increased vigilance and possibly enhanced preventive measures, such as vaccination and public awareness campaigns, to address the growing burden of these respiratory illnesses.
