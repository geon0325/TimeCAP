Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a significant surge in Influenza-like Illness (ILI) across all age groups, with the ratio of ILI patients exceeding the 2.9% benchmark for 15 consecutive weeks, peaking at 7.37% in week 9. The highest ILI incidences were reported among the 5-24 age group, which saw an alarming increase, especially during weeks 5 through 10, aligning with the overall ILI peak. The data for the most recent week shows a decline in ILI cases; however, the percentage of ILI patients remains above the benchmark at 2.70%. This persistent elevation suggests a continued strain on healthcare resources, with a need for sustained vigilance in monitoring and managing ILI cases. The sustained high ratios of ILI patients highlight the potential need for increased healthcare measures, including vaccination and public health interventions, to mitigate further impact.
