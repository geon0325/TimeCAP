Over the last 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has experienced a gradual decline, which is typical for a diurnal pattern but has seen a more significant drop towards the end of the period, indicating a possible weather front moving through the area. Humidity levels were very high for most of the period, suggesting a muggy and uncomfortable atmosphere, but they have seen a dramatic decrease in the latter hours, which may suggest the arrival of a drier air mass. Air pressure was relatively stable at first but showed an increasing trend in the later hours, which could be associated with the approach of a high-pressure system, likely contributing to the clearer and drier conditions. Wind speed varied, with a noticeable peak indicating a period of gustier conditions, possibly due to a passing weather system. The wind direction was predominantly from the south-southeast but shifted significantly towards the later hours, which could correlate with the change in weather patterns suggested by the other indicators.
