Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality rate from Influenza or Pneumonia as a proportion of total deaths has consistently remained below the average ratio of 7.84%, with observed weekly percentages fluctuating between 5.00% and 6.15%. The numbers of deaths specifically attributable to influenza have shown a slight decline over the period, from 41 deaths in the first week to 33 in the last week, while pneumonia-related deaths have seen larger fluctuations with an initial decrease followed by a rebound from 2868 to 3337 in the final weeks. The lowest combined weekly mortality ratio for both diseases was recorded at 5.00%, indicating a possible improvement or seasonal variation, but the concluding weeks suggest a potential uptick as the combined ratio increased to 5.89%. The overall trend suggests that while the mortality rates for these respiratory illnesses are currently below the average, there is variability that warrants continuous monitoring. This data is crucial for healthcare resource planning, as an increasing trend could signal a need for heightened preparedness in managing respiratory diseases.
