Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has experienced a downward trend, declining from 4536.95 to 4307.54, indicating selling pressure and potential investor uncertainty. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, has generally increased, suggesting growing market unease, with recent values spiking above 23. International markets have also shown signs of stress, with the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 indices both exhibiting declines, though the Nikkei 225 demonstrated a more volatile pattern with a brief uptrend before falling again. Commodity prices have been mixed; while Gold Futures have seen a significant drop from 1808.70 to 1755.30, indicative of reduced safe-haven demand, Crude Oil Futures have risen slightly, suggesting a stable or increasing demand for energy. Currency exchange rates have seen the US dollar strengthening against both the Euro and the Japanese Yen, while remaining relatively stable against the Chinese Yuan, which could indicate a flight to the perceived safety of the dollar amidst global uncertainty.
