Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature with a trend towards warming, culminating in a peak towards the end of the observed period. Humidity levels were notably high throughout the day, reaching saturation at several points, which could indicate the presence of fog or mist, particularly during the early hours. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight decrease towards the end of the period, which could suggest an approaching weather system that might lead to changes in weather patterns in the near future. Wind speeds were consistently light, indicating calm weather conditions with no significant gusts that could disrupt daily activities. The wind direction varied but predominantly came from the southwest, which is typical for coastal San Francisco weather patterns and may contribute to the advection of marine air and fog into the city.
