Over the last 24 hours in New York City, there was a gradual increase in temperature peaking in the late afternoon before beginning to cool slightly towards the evening. Humidity levels varied, starting moderate, then increasing significantly in the morning, which could have led to a muggy feel, and finally dropping off towards the late afternoon as temperatures rose, resulting in drier conditions. Air pressure showed a slow declining trend throughout the day, which might suggest the approach of a weather system that could alter conditions in the near future. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate with some increase towards the end of the period, which could have offered some relief from the heat during the warmest part of the day. The wind direction was predominantly from the south to southeast, occasionally shifting, which may have contributed to the warmer air being drawn into the region.
