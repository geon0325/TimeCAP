Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual increase in temperature, which peaked during the late afternoon before cooling slightly. Humidity levels fluctuated, initially high during the cooler early morning hours but decreased midday, indicating drier conditions, before rising again toward the evening. Air pressure remained relatively stable for most of the day, with a significant drop occurring late in the period, suggesting the potential development of a weather system that could impact conditions. Wind speed varied moderately, with some calmer periods and a few instances of slightly brisker winds, while wind direction was predominantly westerly, with notable shifts to both northerly and easterly directions at the end of the period. The combination of the dropping air pressure and changing wind directions could signal an approaching change in weather, potentially bringing variability to the current pattern.
