Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual warming trend with temperatures reaching a peak during the latter part of the day before stabilizing. Humidity levels showed significant variation, with notable increases during the early hours, indicative of the potential for morning fog that is common in the region, followed by drier conditions towards the afternoon. Air pressure has been steadily increasing, suggesting a period of stable weather conditions. Wind speeds were mostly moderate to low throughout the day, with a period of calm winds in the early morning, potentially contributing to cooler ground-level temperatures and the dispersal of any fog or low-lying clouds as the day progressed. Wind direction varied but predominantly came from the west and northwest, which is typical for San Francisco's climate, and could influence coastal fog patterns along the shoreline.
