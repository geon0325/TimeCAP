Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature with a general trend of cooling followed by a moderate warming period in the afternoon, typical of the diurnal cycle. Humidity levels varied inversely with temperature, reaching their peak during the cooler early morning hours and decreasing as temperatures rose, which is indicative of the capacity of air to hold moisture. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with only minor variations, suggesting a period of settled weather without significant frontal activity. Wind speeds were consistently light, which would have contributed to a calm weather pattern and potentially allowed for local temperature and humidity effects to be more pronounced. The wind direction shifted throughout the day, predominantly from southeasterly to southerly directions, which in Houston could signal the influence of Gulf air masses on local weather conditions.
