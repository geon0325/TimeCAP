Over the past 24 hours in New York City, temperatures have shown a decreasing trend, starting from mild conditions and moving towards cooler temperatures by the end of the period. Relative humidity levels have generally increased, indicating more moisture in the air which could lead to a feeling of chilliness despite the actual temperature. Air pressure has been steadily rising, suggesting the strengthening of a high-pressure system that could lead to more stable and dry weather conditions. Wind speeds varied, with some stronger gusts at times, but overall wind activity decreased towards the end of the 24-hour period. Wind direction shifted from primarily northerly to easterly and then southerly directions, which could influence temperature patterns and possibly bring in different air masses affecting the local weather.
