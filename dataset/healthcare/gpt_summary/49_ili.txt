Over the past 20 weeks, the data indicates a fluctuating trend in the number of patients presenting with Influenza-like Illness (ILI), with a notable peak occurring mid-period before a gradual decline. The ratio of ILI patients, which serves as a key indicator for the prevalence of influenza, has surpassed the baseline of 2.9% during several weeks, reaching its highest in the latter half of the observed period, suggesting a significant period of increased ILI activity. Age-specific ILI incidence was highest among the youngest (0-4 years) and school-aged children (5-24 years), potentially reflecting greater susceptibility or transmission rates within these demographics. After the peak, there was a noticeable decrease across all age groups, with the most substantial decline observed in the youngest age group. This pattern of ILI activity has implications for healthcare resource allocation, particularly in pediatrics and primary care, and may influence public health strategies aimed at mitigating the spread of influenza among the most affected populations.
