Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before cooling slightly toward the evening. Humidity levels varied significantly, starting with moderate values before rising to very high levels during the night and early morning, which could have potentially contributed to foggy conditions, a common occurrence in the area. Air pressure remained fairly stable throughout the day with only slight fluctuations, indicating steady weather conditions without the immediate likelihood of significant weather disturbances. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with some hours of calmer conditions, and the wind direction shifted multiple times, suggesting the presence of varying local weather systems influencing the area. The combination of high humidity, varying wind directions, and stable air pressure could result in morning coastal fog and relatively mild and stable weather patterns for the immediate future.
