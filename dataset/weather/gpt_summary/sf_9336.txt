Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature, with a general trend of cooling overnight followed by warming during the day. Humidity levels experienced significant variations, reaching saturation at certain points, which could have led to foggy conditions, particularly when combined with the stable air pressure observed during these peaks. Speaking of air pressure, it generally remained stable but showed some spikes, indicating the potential passage of different weather systems. Wind conditions were predominantly calm with little variation in speed, and the wind direction was mostly consistent with occasional shifts, suggesting a steady weather pattern without any significant frontal activity. The combination of these factors suggests a stable weather pattern with the possibility of morning fog clearing into sunny conditions as the day progresses.
