Over the past 24 hours in New York City, the temperature has exhibited a gradual increase, suggesting a mild warming trend. Humidity levels remained high for most of the period, indicating a moist air mass over the city, but there was a noticeable drop in humidity later in the period, which could signal the arrival of a drier air mass. During the same time frame, air pressure decreased significantly before rising again, which is indicative of a transient weather system moving through the area. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate and increased over time, which could enhance the wind chill effect, especially when combined with the higher temperatures. The wind direction shifted from southwesterly to westerly and then to northwesterly, suggesting that a frontal system may have passed through, potentially bringing changes in weather conditions.
