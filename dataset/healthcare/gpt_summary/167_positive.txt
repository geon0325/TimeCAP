Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the number of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a peak positivity ratio of 26.24% in week 10 and a subsequent decline to 4.82% by week 20. Influenza A has been the predominant subtype throughout the time frame, reaching a high positivity ratio of 25.36% in week 10 before falling to 3.14% by week 20, indicating a significant decrease in incidence. In contrast, Influenza B maintained a lower positivity ratio, peaking at 1.28% in week 14 and decreasing slightly to 1.68% by week 20, suggesting a more stable but consistent presence. The initial high ratios of positive specimens, particularly for Influenza A, could have placed a strain on healthcare resources due to increased patient volume and potential hospitalizations. The observed decline in positivity rates suggests a downward trend in influenza activity, which may lead to reduced healthcare system burden if the trend continues.
