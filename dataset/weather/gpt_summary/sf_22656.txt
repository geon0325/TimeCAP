Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature, showing a gradual increase towards the latter part of the period. Humidity levels were notably high, often reaching saturation, which could have led to foggy conditions, especially during the early hours. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, indicating a period of consistent weather patterns without the immediate likelihood of significant weather disturbances. Wind speeds were generally light to gentle and did not show any significant changes, which could have contributed to the persistent high humidity levels by not dispersing moisture-laden air. The wind direction was predominantly from the southwest, with slight variations, which is typical for the region's climate.
