Over the last 20 weeks, the incidence of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) has remained below the baseline threshold, with a gradual increase in the ratio of ILI patients, suggesting a slowly intensifying ILI activity within the population. Most notably, there is a rising trend in ILI cases among the age groups 25-49 and 50-64, which could indicate a shift in the burden of ILI to these demographics, thus potentially impacting workforce productivity and healthcare resource allocation. Despite the overall increase, ILI rates have not yet crossed the baseline of concern, but continued surveillance is crucial as the upward trend suggests a possible approach to or exceedance of the threshold in the near future. Age groups 0-4 and 65 or more have shown less pronounced changes, but should still be monitored closely due to the vulnerability of these age ranges to influenza complications. Effective communication and preventive measures, such as vaccination and public health education, are recommended to mitigate a further rise in ILI rates and to prepare for a potential strain on the healthcare system.
