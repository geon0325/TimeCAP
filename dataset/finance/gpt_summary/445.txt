Over the past 20 market days, the S&P 500 index exhibited volatility with an overall upward trend, closing higher by 2.78% from 3419.44 to 3369.16, despite some intermittent declines. The VIX, or Volatility Index, mirrored this uncertainty, starting at 28.06 and spiking to 40.28 before settling at 35.55, indicating an increased level of market stress. International markets showed mixed performance, with Japan's Nikkei 225 remaining relatively flat, closing at 23295.48 from an opening of 23422.82, while the UK's FTSE 100 experienced a more pronounced dip, finishing at 5786.80 down from 5946.30, which could suggest regional economic pressures.

Commodity prices saw Gold Futures fluctuate but ultimately increase from 1883.60 to 1908.50, a sign that investors may be seeking safe-haven assets amidst market uncertainty, whereas Crude Oil Futures faced a decline from 39.95 to 37.66, potentially reflecting ongoing concerns over global demand in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Exchange rates against the USD showed the Euro (EUR/USD) and Japanese Yen (USD/JYP) slightly weakening over the period, closing at 1.16 and 104.72 respectively, while the Chinese Yuan (USD/CNY) remained fairly stable, ending at 6.69 from an opening of 6.79, which might suggest the Yuan is becoming a steadier currency in foreign exchange markets.
