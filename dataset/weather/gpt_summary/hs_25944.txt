Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature experienced a notable fluctuation, with a gradual increase during the day that peaked in the late afternoon before stabilizing toward the evening. Humidity levels were high during the early hours, reaching saturation at times, which could have contributed to foggy conditions or morning dew; however, there was a significant drop in humidity as the temperature peaked, suggesting a drier atmosphere during the hottest part of the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight dip later in the period, which could indicate the approach of a weather system that may affect conditions in the near future. Wind speeds were mostly light to gentle, with some variability in intensity but no significant gusts, providing little relief from the heat during the warmest periods. The wind direction was predominantly from the south-southeast, shifting slightly throughout the day, which is typical for Houston and may have contributed to the moisture levels observed in the morning.
