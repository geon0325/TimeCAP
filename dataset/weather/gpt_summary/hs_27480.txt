Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a slight fluctuation in temperature, maintaining generally mild conditions. Humidity levels experienced a marked increase during the night, which is typical due to cooling temperatures, but then decreased significantly towards the end of the period, suggesting the possibility of a drier air mass moving into the area. Air pressure showed a rising trend in the latter hours, indicating the potential development or approach of a high-pressure system, which is often associated with more stable weather conditions. Wind speeds increased substantially towards the end of the twenty-four-hour period, which could lead to windier conditions that might affect outdoor activities and aviation. The wind direction varied significantly, with a notable shift from predominantly easterly winds to a strong northerly component and then a sharp change to southerly, suggesting the passage of a weather front and the possible introduction of different air masses over the region.
