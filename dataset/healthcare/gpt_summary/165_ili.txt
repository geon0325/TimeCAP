The Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data over the last 20 weeks indicates a declining trend in the proportion of ILI patients across all age groups, with the overall ILI patient ratio consistently dropping below the baseline threshold of 2.9%. Initially, the total number of patients presenting with ILI symptoms was above this baseline, suggesting an active period of ILI circulation. However, as the weeks progressed, there was a noticeable decrease in ILI incidence, reaching a level significantly lower than the baseline by the end of the observed period. The most pronounced reduction in ILI cases appears among the youngest age group (0-4 years), followed by those in the 5-24 year age bracket, which might suggest successful containment measures or natural seasonal decline. This downward trajectory in ILI cases could potentially lead to a decrease in the healthcare burden related to influenza, allowing resources to be allocated to other areas of need.
