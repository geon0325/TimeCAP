Over the past 20 weeks, there has been an upward trend in the proportion of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases across all age groups, surpassing the benchmark severity level of 2.9% in week six and peaking at 6.90% in week 14. The age group of 5-24 years has experienced the most significant increase in ILI cases, suggesting that schools and universities might be major vectors for transmission. The elderly population (age 65 or more) shows a relatively steady ILI incidence but represents a vulnerable group that could be severely affected by influenza. The persistent elevation above the severity threshold for the past 15 consecutive weeks indicates a robust and prolonged influenza season, which could strain healthcare resources, necessitating increased preparedness for ILI management. The most recent data indicates a slight decrease in the ratio of ILI patients to below 5%, suggesting the possibility of a declining phase of the influenza season, but continuous monitoring is essential to confirm this trend.
