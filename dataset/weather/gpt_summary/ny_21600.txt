Over the past 24 hours in New York City, there has been a gradual increase in temperature, transitioning from below to slightly above freezing. Humidity levels have remained extremely high, consistently at or near saturation, which could have led to persistent fog or drizzle. Atmospheric pressure has shown a slow declining trend, indicating the weakening of a high-pressure system that could lead to changing weather patterns or the potential for precipitation. Wind speeds have been light and fairly stable throughout the period, with no significant gusts that would impact conditions greatly. However, there has been a notable shift in wind direction, starting from easterly and shifting towards a more southerly and then westerly direction, which could signal a change in the incoming weather systems.
