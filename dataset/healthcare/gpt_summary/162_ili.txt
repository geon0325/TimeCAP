The analysis of the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data over the last 20 weeks shows a decreasing trend in the percentage of patients with ILI across all age groups. Initially, the ratio of ILI patients was significantly above the baseline threshold, indicating a period of high ILI activity. Over time, this ratio has steadily declined, falling below the baseline in the latter part of the analyzed period, suggesting a reduction in ILI spread and cases. The most significant decrease was observed in the youngest age group (0-4 years), which typically is a vulnerable population for ILI. The declining trend in ILI patient ratios is indicative of a potential easing of the healthcare burden related to influenza, but continuous monitoring is essential to manage and respond to any future fluctuations in ILI activity.
