The VIX, which measures market volatility, has gradually decreased, indicating a potential increase in investor confidence as it moved from 31.37 to 22.52. In international markets, the Nikkei 225 has also experienced fluctuations but ended the period with a significant gain, suggesting a positive outlook in the Japanese market, while the FTSE 100 showed moderate growth, ending at 7318.00. Gold Futures rose sharply, from 1657.00 to 1766.00, which may indicate a flight to safety or inflationary concerns among investors. The currency markets witnessed the weakening of the USD against the EUR and JPY, with the EUR/USD pair climbing from 0.97 to 1.02 and the USD/JPY pair dropping significantly from 148.63 to 141.73, which could suggest a shift in currency strength dynamics and potential implications for international trade and investment flows.
