Over the past 20 weeks, the data indicate a rising trend in the percentage of patients presenting with Influenza-like Illness (ILI), surpassing the baseline threshold of 2.9% in the latter half of the observed period. The most significant increase in ILI cases has been among the age group of 5-24 years, with a peak that coincides with the overall highest ratio of ILI patients. This surge, particularly in a younger population, could indicate increased transmission within communal settings such as schools and universities. The age groups of 25-49 and 50-64 have also shown an uptick in ILI cases, though less pronounced than in the younger demographic, suggesting that the virus is affecting a broad range of the population. The healthcare system may face increased pressure due to this upward trend in ILI cases, necessitating resource allocation towards managing and controlling the spread of influenza-like illnesses.
