Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature, with a gradual decrease during the early hours followed by a significant rise through the afternoon, which is typical as the day progresses from night to peak daytime. Humidity levels have varied inversely with temperature, starting at moderate levels before dawn and increasing as temperatures dropped to their lowest point, then decreasing again as temperatures rose, which is consistent with the typical diurnal pattern of relative humidity. Air pressure remained fairly stable with only slight variations, indicating a relatively steady atmospheric condition without the presence of strong weather fronts or systems during this period. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a period of calm conditions during the early morning hours; however, speeds increased later in the day, which could contribute to changes in weather patterns, such as the dispersal of any present moisture or cloud cover. Wind direction shifted from northerly in the early hours to predominantly southeasterly by the end of the period, suggesting a change in the source region of air masses affecting the area, which could potentially lead to warmer and more humid conditions moving forward.
