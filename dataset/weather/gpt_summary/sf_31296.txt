Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before slightly cooling down towards the evening. Humidity levels varied significantly but showed an upward trend, with particularly high values during the night, indicative of a moisture-laden atmosphere. Air pressure exhibited a decreasing trend throughout the day, which could suggest an approaching weather system with the potential for changing weather patterns. Wind speeds were mostly moderate but had periods of increased intensity, especially during the early morning hours, and the wind direction was variable with a general shift from southwesterly to westerly winds. These meteorological conditions, including the high humidity and decreasing pressure, could lead to cloudier skies or fog, which is characteristic of the San Francisco area.
