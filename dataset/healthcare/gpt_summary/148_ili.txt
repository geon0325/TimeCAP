The analysis of the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data over the last 20 weeks indicates a notable fluctuation in ILI activity, with a pronounced peak that considerably exceeds the baseline ratio for ILI. Initially, the ratio of ILI patients remained below the threshold, but as weeks progressed, a significant increase was observed, with the highest ratios concentrated in the middle weeks of the time series. This surge in ILI cases particularly affected the younger age groups, with school-aged children and preschoolers showing the most pronounced increases in ILI incidence. Following the peak, there has been a gradual decline in ILI ratios, yet they remained above the baseline for several weeks before falling below it again in the latest data. The heightened ILI activity, especially among younger populations, suggests the need for increased healthcare resources during peak periods, and it underscores the importance of monitoring ILI trends for timely public health interventions and healthcare planning.
