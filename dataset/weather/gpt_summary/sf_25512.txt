Over the past day in San Francisco, temperatures exhibited a typical diurnal pattern with a peak during the afternoon hours followed by a gradual cooling towards the evening and overnight. Relative humidity levels varied inversely with temperature, indicating higher moisture content in the air during the cooler night and early morning hours. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight fluctuation, suggesting no major weather fronts passing through the area during the observed time frame. Wind speeds varied, with a period of stronger winds, shifting to lighter breezes later in the day, while the wind direction was predominantly westerly, which is typical for San Francisco due to its coastal location. The combination of these conditions would likely result in a generally mild weather pattern with a possibility of coastal fog, particularly during the morning and evening hours when humidity was at its peak.
