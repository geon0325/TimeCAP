Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 displayed a gradual uptrend, rising from 4112.50 to 4239.18, suggesting a positive sentiment among equity investors. The VIX index, which measures market volatility, showed a general decrease from 23.13 to 16.10, indicating that investors' fear levels have diminished, correlating with the rising stock market. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 also exhibited an upward trajectory, with the Nikkei making significant gains from 27448.01 to 28958.56, and the FTSE 100 showing modest growth, ending slightly higher than its starting point. Commodity prices such as Gold and Crude Oil Futures have been relatively stable with a slight uptick in prices, suggesting that while there is some investor interest in safe-haven assets and energy commodities, there hasn't been a significant shift to these assets. The exchange rates for EUR/USD and USD/JPY remained fairly stable with minor fluctuations, while USD/CNY experienced a slight depreciation of the dollar against the yuan, which could indicate a modest strengthening of the Chinese currency.
