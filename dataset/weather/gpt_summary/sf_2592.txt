Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual increase in temperature, starting from a cool early morning to a relatively warmer afternoon, followed by a slight decrease towards the current hour. Humidity levels varied significantly, with higher values during the cooler early hours, which is typical due to cooler air holding less moisture, and lower values as temperatures peaked, indicating drier conditions during warmer periods of the day. Air pressure showed a subtle decreasing trend throughout the day, which could suggest a gradual shift in weather patterns or the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds remained generally light with a few periods of calm; however, there was variability in wind direction, suggesting that there was not a dominant weather front influencing the wind patterns over the city. Overall, the weather in San Francisco has been stable, but the decrease in air pressure might be indicative of potential changes on the horizon.
