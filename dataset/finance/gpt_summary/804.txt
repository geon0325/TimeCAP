Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility but ended on a slightly positive note, moving from an initial position of 4204.31 points to close at 4500.21 points, indicating some resilience in the U.S. stock market. The VIX, which is a measure of market volatility, generally decreased from 30.75 to 21.55, suggesting that investor fear has subsided over the period, potentially signaling increased market stability. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 also exhibited upward trends, with the Nikkei 225 making a significant leap, particularly in the latter half of the observed period, despite closing lower in the last session, while the FTSE 100 showed a steady increase overall.

Commodity prices showed mixed movements: Gold Futures saw slight fluctuations but ultimately increased from 1982.70 to 1933.80, which may indicate investors' sustained interest in safe-haven assets amidst market uncertainties. Crude Oil Futures experienced more pronounced swings with a peak at 114.93 before retracting to 96.03, reflecting ongoing volatility in energy markets likely influenced by geopolitical tensions and supply concerns. Exchange rates for major currencies against the USD showed the euro (EUR/USD) and the yuan (USD/CNY) mostly stable around 1.10 and 6.36 respectively, while the yen (USD/JPY) appreciated against the dollar, moving from 116.18 to 123.72, which could suggest a shifting sentiment towards the Japanese economy or changes in monetary policy expectations.
