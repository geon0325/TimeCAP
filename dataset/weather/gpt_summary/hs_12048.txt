Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have shown a gradual increase, moving from cooler to warmer conditions as the day progressed. Relative humidity levels started moderately but increased significantly, suggesting the presence of more moisture in the air which could potentially lead to cloud formation or fog. Air pressure remained fairly stable with a slight downward trend, which is often associated with stable or deteriorating weather conditions. Wind speeds varied, with periods of calm and a tendency towards increasing speeds towards the end of the 24-hour period, indicating the possibility of a developing weather system. The wind direction was predominantly from the south-east to the south, which for Houston could suggest the influx of warmer, moister air from the Gulf of Mexico, potentially influencing local weather patterns.
