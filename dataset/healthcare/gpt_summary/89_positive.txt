Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable increase in the proportion of respiratory specimens testing positive for both Influenza A and B, with the total positive ratio climbing from 2.65% to 3.61%. Influenza A showed a more significant rise in positivity rate, increasing from 1.27% to 2.51%, while Influenza B also exhibited an upward trend, from 1.38% to 1.09%. The highest increase in positive cases for both strains occurred in the most recent week, indicating a potential uptick in influenza activity. Despite the average positive specimen ratio being 6.26%, the latest week's rate surpasses this average, suggesting a surge that could strain healthcare resources. This trend warrants close monitoring and possibly increased healthcare preparedness for a potential influx of influenza patients.
