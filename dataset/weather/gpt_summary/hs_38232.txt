Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak during the late afternoon before starting to slightly cool down towards the evening. Humidity levels were relatively high at the start of the period, hitting saturation during the early morning hours, but subsequently showed a significant decrease as temperatures rose, suggesting a typical diurnal pattern. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight declining trend, which could indicate the potential for changing weather patterns or the approach of a weather front. Wind speeds varied, with an increase observed during the afternoon, potentially contributing to the decrease in humidity by dispersing moisture. The wind direction was predominantly from the south to south-east, which is commonly associated with warm air being drawn up from the Gulf, contributing to the warmer temperatures observed.
