Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a slight decrease in temperature, suggesting a minor cooling trend. Humidity levels showed fluctuations, with a noticeable increase around the middle of the time series, which could have contributed to a feeling of increased chilliness despite the relatively stable temperatures. Air pressure experienced a significant increase mid-series, indicating a potential shift in weather patterns, such as the possible arrival of a high-pressure system which typically brings clearer skies. Wind speeds varied with a period of increased velocity, suggesting gusty conditions that may have amplified the cooler temperatures. The wind direction was predominantly from the northwest, with slight variations, which is common for cooler and drier air masses moving into the area.
