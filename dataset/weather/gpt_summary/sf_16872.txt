Over the past day in San Francisco, temperatures have experienced a mild fluctuation, indicative of a typical diurnal pattern with cooler conditions in the early hours and a gradual warming trend towards the afternoon. Humidity levels remained high throughout the period, even reaching saturation during the night and early morning, which could have led to foggy conditions, particularly near coastal areas. Air pressure showed a slight but steady increase, suggesting stable weather conditions and the absence of significant storm systems in the vicinity. Wind speeds were light and mostly consistent, with very little variation, implying a calm weather pattern without gusty conditions. The wind direction was predominantly from the west-southwest, which is common for the region, influenced by the Pacific Ocean's marine airflow.
