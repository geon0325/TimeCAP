Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia as a percentage of total deaths has generally trended downward, with a peak of 8.47% in the first week and ending at 5.78% in the final week, below the 20-week average of 7.84%. The total number of deaths has fluctuated, with a noticeable dip to 24,395 in week 15, followed by a sharp increase in subsequent weeks, suggesting a potential backlog or reporting anomaly. The absolute number of deaths attributed to Influenza or Pneumonia has also decreased over this period, with pneumonia consistently accounting for a significant majority of these deaths. The lowest percentage of deaths from Influenza or Pneumonia relative to total deaths occurred in the last week of reporting, indicating a possible improvement or seasonal decline in these respiratory infections. Healthcare systems may experience varying degrees of pressure due to these trends, with the recent decrease potentially alleviating some strain, but the overall fluctuation in mortality rates underscores the need for continued vigilance and resource readiness.
