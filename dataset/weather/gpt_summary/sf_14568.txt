Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual decrease in temperature during the night, reaching its lowest point before dawn, followed by a consistent warming trend as the day progressed. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with an extremely high percentage during the early hours, indicating possible fog or mist conditions, but then notably dropped to unusually low levels in the late afternoon, which is atypical for the coastal city. Air pressure remained fairly stable throughout the day with a slight rise towards the evening, suggesting stable weather conditions might persist. Wind speeds varied, with some brisk winds in the early hours transitioning to calmer conditions around midday and a slight increase later on, potentially affecting the feel of the temperature due to wind chill factors. Wind direction shifted from predominantly north-easterly in the early hours to westerly and then varied throughout the day, which could bring changes in temperature and moisture levels from different air masses.
