Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature from the day into the night, followed by a typical rebound during the daytime. Humidity levels have varied significantly, reaching their peak during the cooler early morning hours and dropping markedly during the afternoon, indicative of the diurnal pattern influenced by local maritime effects. Atmospheric pressure has remained relatively stable and high, suggesting steady weather conditions without significant perturbations. Wind speeds have been mostly moderate but showed a decrease during the night, which is common as the land cools and the pressure gradient weakens. The wind direction has been variable, swinging between westerly and easterly directions, which may be associated with the passing of local weather systems or the influence of topographical features such as the surrounding hills and the bay.
