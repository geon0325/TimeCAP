Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual increase in temperature reaching its peak in the latest recorded hour, indicative of a warming trend. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly throughout the period, with a notable increase during the cooler early hours and a subsequent decrease as temperatures rose. Air pressure showed a general stability for most of the day but experienced a sharp drop recently, suggesting a potential change in weather conditions, such as the approach of a weather front. Wind speeds were mostly moderate with a slight increase towards the latter part of the period, while wind direction shifted from predominantly westerly to a more variable pattern with notable easterly winds later on. This combination of dropping air pressure, increased temperature, and shifting wind patterns could signal the arrival of a new weather system, possibly affecting local weather conditions in the near future.
