Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a slight upward trend, closing higher by approximately 1.71% from 2784.70 to 2832.57, indicating a degree of investor confidence in the stability of the U.S. equity market. The VIX, commonly known as the "fear index," has remained relatively subdued with minor fluctuations, ending slightly lower at 13.56 from an opening of 14.02, which suggests that market volatility has been stable and investor sentiment has not dramatically shifted. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have experienced some volatility; however, both closed the period higher by approximately 0.63% and 1.32% respectively, indicating resilience in these markets despite ongoing global economic uncertainties. Gold futures showed modest volatility but remained in a tight range, ending at $1305.00, suggesting that investors are maintaining interest in safe-haven assets amidst market conditions. The exchange rates for EUR/USD and USD/JPY have been relatively stable with slight appreciation of the Euro and the Yen against the Dollar, while USD/CNY has seen a minor depreciation of the Dollar against the Chinese Yuan, reflecting subtle shifts in currency markets that may be driven by trade talks and global economic policy developments.
