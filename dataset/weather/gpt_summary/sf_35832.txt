Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature during the night, followed by a notable increase during the daytime, indicative of typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels showed variability, peaking at certain hours, likely corresponding to the early morning and late evening, which could have led to the formation of fog, a common occurrence in this coastal city. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight decreasing trend towards the current hour, suggesting stable weather conditions but with a potential for change. Wind speeds were generally light with some variability, and wind direction shifted throughout the day, which is characteristic of the region's varied topography and coastal influence. Overall, the weather in San Francisco has been stable, but residents should be mindful of the cooler temperatures at night and possible changes in conditions due to the slight decrease in pressure.
