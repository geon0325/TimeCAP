Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a marked increase in the ratio of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, rising from 1.94% in week 1 to 26.94% in week 20. The incidence of Influenza A has shown a more significant rise compared to Influenza B, with positive specimen ratios for Influenza A jumping from 1.28% to 22.19%, while Influenza B ratios increased from 0.66% to 4.75% in the same period. The total number of specimens tested has also grown substantially, from 9,404 in the first week to 68,276 in the twentieth week, indicating an escalation in testing alongside the increase in positivity rates. The sharp rise in positive cases, particularly of Influenza A, suggests a significant wave of influenza infections, which could lead to increased hospital admissions and a potential strain on healthcare resources. Given these trends, healthcare providers may need to enhance their preparedness for handling an influx of influenza patients, including considerations for vaccination strategies, antiviral stockpiling, and resource allocation.
