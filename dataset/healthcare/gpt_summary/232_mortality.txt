Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in the mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia as a percentage of total deaths, starting at 6.13% and peaking at 16.83% before decreasing to 9.74%. This peak represents more than double the average ratio of 7.84%, indicating a significant increase in such respiratory-related mortalities during the period. The total number of deaths has been rising, with a peak at week 10, followed by a slight decline, while the absolute number of deaths from pneumonia has increased significantly, from 3474 to 6145 deaths, with a notable surge starting at week 7. The number of deaths from influenza remained relatively low in comparison, yet increased towards the end of the period. These trends suggest a substantial burden on the healthcare system, potentially requiring increased resources for managing respiratory illnesses, and could indicate a need for public health interventions to address the rise in pneumonia and influenza-related mortalities.
