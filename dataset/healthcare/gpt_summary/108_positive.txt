Over the last 20 weeks, the data shows a significant fluctuation in the number of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a notable peak in the ratio of positive specimens reaching up to 27.37% by week 13, before displaying a gradual decline. The prevalence of Influenza A has been more pronounced than Influenza B throughout the period, peaking at 21.62% in week 9, although its incidence has since decreased to 6.38% by week 20. In contrast, Influenza B showed a slower increase but a less pronounced decrease, peaking at 9.65% in week 15, and remaining elevated at 9.20% in week 20, indicating a sustained circulation of Influenza B in the population. The overall decline in positive specimens to 15.58% by week 20, however, suggests a possible tapering of the influenza season, but with Influenza B maintaining a more persistent presence than A. These trends are critical for healthcare resource allocation, suggesting a need for continued vigilance for Influenza B and potential adjustments in public health interventions.
