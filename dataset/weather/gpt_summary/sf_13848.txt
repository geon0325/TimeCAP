Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a slight decrease in temperature, which experienced a modest dip during the early hours before gradually rising again later in the day. Humidity levels showed a marked increase overnight, reaching near-saturation in the early morning, indicative of possible fog or mist formation, before decreasing again as temperatures rose. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with a minor decrease towards the end of the period, suggesting stable weather conditions may persist. Wind speeds were consistently light, with little variation, which may have contributed to the higher humidity levels by reducing air circulation. The wind direction was predominantly westerly, with minor fluctuations, which is typical for coastal San Francisco due to its maritime climate.
