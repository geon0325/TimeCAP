Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 exhibited volatility with a notable decline, starting at 4026.12 and ending at 3822.39, indicating a bearish market sentiment. The VIX, also known as the fear gauge, fluctuated but ended higher at 21.97 compared to its starting point of 20.50, which aligns with the increased market uncertainty. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 also faced downward pressure, though the FTSE 100 showed some resilience with a less pronounced decline and a brief upturn towards the end of the period.

Gold futures initially declined but then surged to a peak of 1815.90 before retracting, suggesting that investors turned to gold as a safe haven amidst market turbulence. The exchange rates showed the euro and yen strengthening against the US dollar, while the Chinese yuan remained relatively stable, reflecting a potential shift in investor confidence towards non-dollar assets in light of the broader market volatility.
