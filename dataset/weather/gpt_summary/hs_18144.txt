Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has experienced a pattern of gradual decrease during the night, followed by a significant rise throughout the day, suggesting a typical diurnal cycle with warmer daytime temperatures. Humidity levels have shown a converse relationship with temperature, increasing as temperatures fell during the night and decreasing as temperatures rose, which is typical given the capacity of air to hold moisture changes with temperature. Air pressure has remained relatively stable with a slight increasing trend, indicating consistent atmospheric conditions without significant weather fronts moving through the area. Wind speeds have been generally light with a slight decrease throughout the period, which could contribute to a feeling of increased warmth during the day and potentially impact air quality. The wind direction has varied, predominantly coming from the south-southeast, which is common for the region and may bring moist Gulf air into the area, affecting local humidity levels.
