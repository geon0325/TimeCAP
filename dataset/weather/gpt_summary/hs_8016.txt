Over the last 24 hours in Houston, the temperature experienced a general declining trend during the night, followed by a notable increase during the daytime, suggesting a typical diurnal pattern. Humidity levels fluctuated inversely with temperature, increasing overnight and decreasing as temperatures rose, which is common in areas where daytime heating leads to lower relative humidity. Air pressure remained relatively stable, indicating a period without significant weather fronts or systems affecting the area. Throughout the period, wind speeds were light and fairly consistent, with no significant gusts or calm periods, which could imply a steady weather pattern. The wind direction gradually shifted from southeasterly to southwesterly, likely influenced by local land and sea breezes given Houston's proximity to the coast.
