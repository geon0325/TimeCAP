Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a significant decrease in both the number of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza and the percentage of positive tests. The peak of positive influenza cases occurred in the week with a 30.26% positivity rate, which has since plummeted to 0.26% in the most recent data, indicating a pronounced downward trend in influenza activity. The data shows a substantial decline in Influenza A and B cases, with the positive percentage for Influenza A dropping from a high of 19.31% to 0.19%, and Influenza B decreasing from 17.59% to 0.08%. This reduction in influenza cases could potentially alleviate the burden on healthcare resources, allowing for a reallocation of efforts to other areas of need. However, continued monitoring is essential to ensure readiness for any potential resurgence of influenza infections.
