Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant upward trend in the ratio of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, growing from a low of 1.31% to a peak of 30.26%. The number of specimens tested has increased, suggesting heightened surveillance or increased incidence of respiratory illness, with the highest number of tests being recorded in the last two weeks, at over 72,000 each week. Influenza A has consistently shown a higher positivity rate compared to Influenza B, with its ratio nearly tripling from 0.88% to 18.03%, indicative of its dominant presence in the circulating strains. Conversely, Influenza B started at a higher positivity rate than A but has seen a less dramatic increase, indicating a substantial but slower growth in cases. The concurrent rise in both strains underscores an escalating burden on the healthcare system, necessitating increased resources for patient care and preventative measures such as vaccination campaigns.
