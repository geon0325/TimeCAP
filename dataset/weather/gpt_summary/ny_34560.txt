Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, followed by a modest rebound, indicating a typical diurnal pattern with a cooler night progressing into a warmer day. Humidity levels exhibited significant variation, with particularly high levels during the early hours, suggesting the possibility of morning mist or fog, which would have cleared as the humidity decreased later in the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable overall but showed a slight increasing trend, which is often associated with improving weather conditions and the potential for clearer skies. Wind speeds increased during the day, reaching their peak in the afternoon, which could have led to brisk conditions, especially when combined with the higher gusts and shifts in wind direction from southerly to a more northwesterly direction. These shifts in wind direction along with the noted increase in wind speed could be indicative of a frontal passage through the area, potentially heralding a change in weather patterns.
