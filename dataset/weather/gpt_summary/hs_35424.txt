Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a notable fluctuation in temperature, peaking during the afternoon hours, which is typical for the region's warm climate. Humidity levels showed a significant increase overnight, reaching high values that suggest an oppressive feel to the air before decreasing markedly as temperatures rose. Air pressure experienced a slight decline throughout the day, indicating a potential change in weather patterns or the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds remained relatively low and stable, with a slight increase towards the end of the period, which typically does not result in major weather changes unless accompanied by other indicators. The wind direction was predominantly from the south-southeast, which in Houston's geographic context, often brings in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, contributing to the humidity levels observed.
