Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a slight decrease in temperature, indicating a trend towards cooler weather. Humidity levels saw minor fluctuations but remained relatively high, suggesting a persistent dampness in the air. Air pressure experienced a notable increase mid-period, which could be indicative of a transient high-pressure system passing through, potentially leading to clearer skies. Wind speeds remained mostly light to gentle and did not show significant change, which would have had a minor impact on perceived temperatures. The wind direction shifted dramatically at one point, but predominantly, winds came from the northeast, which is typical for the region at this time of year and could bring cooler maritime air from the Atlantic.
