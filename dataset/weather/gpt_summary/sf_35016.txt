Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperature demonstrated a typical diurnal pattern with a peak during the daytime and a drop towards the late evening and early morning hours. Humidity levels saw significant variation, with higher values recorded in the earlier hours and a substantial decrease towards the afternoon, indicating drier conditions which then increased again in the evening. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with only minor fluctuations, suggesting steady weather conditions without the immediate approach of a significant weather system. Wind speeds were generally light to calm with a brief period of increased wind activity in the later hours, which could influence the dispersion of any coastal fog or low-level clouds. The wind direction varied but was predominantly from the south to southeast, except for a noticeable shift to a westerly direction in the later hours, which is typical for coastal regions influenced by sea breezes.
