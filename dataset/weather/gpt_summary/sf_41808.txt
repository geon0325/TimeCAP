Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual decline in temperature followed by a moderate increase, suggesting a typical diurnal temperature variation with cooler conditions overnight warming up during the day. Humidity levels were relatively high for a significant portion of the time, even reaching saturation at one point, which could have led to fog or mist, particularly in the early hours. There was a substantial drop in air pressure mid-period, which typically indicates an approaching weather system that could bring unsettled conditions. Wind speeds remained mostly light to moderate throughout the period, with a few fluctuations, and wind direction varied, suggesting the presence of variable and potentially changing weather patterns. The combination of these factors suggests that San Francisco may have experienced some variability in the weather, with potential for morning fog, followed by clearing conditions, and possibly more changeable weather due to the pressure drop.
