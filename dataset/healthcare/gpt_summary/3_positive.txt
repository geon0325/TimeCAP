Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a significant upward trend in the ratio of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with an increase from 1.11% in the first week to 23.65% in the latest week, indicating a substantial rise in influenza activity. The number of specimens tested has also increased over time, from 13,537 to 36,781, which may reflect a higher demand for testing due to increased incidence of respiratory illness or heightened surveillance. Influenza A has consistently been the dominant subtype, with its positivity rate growing from 0.72% to 18.16%, while Influenza B also showed a notable increase from 0.38% to 5.49%. The steep rise in positive specimens, particularly for Influenza A, could place a significant burden on healthcare resources, necessitating preparedness for increased hospital admissions and potential strain on outpatient services. This trend highlights the importance of public health measures, such as vaccination and hygiene practices, to mitigate the impact of the influenza season on the healthcare system.
