Over the course of the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable increase in both the number of respiratory specimens tested for influenza and the number of specimens testing positive for Influenza A and B. The overall percentage of positive specimens has risen from 1.30% to 2.06%, exceeding the 20-week average of 1.46%. Influenza A has shown a more pronounced increase in positivity rate, escalating from 0.57% to 1.58%, suggesting a significant growth in its prevalence. In contrast, Influenza B displayed a less dramatic rise, with its positivity rate growing from 0.73% to 0.47%. This upward trend in influenza cases may indicate the onset of a more active influenza season, which could potentially strain healthcare resources if it continues to rise.
