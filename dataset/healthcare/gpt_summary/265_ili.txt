The reported cases of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) have shown a decreasing trend over the past 20 weeks, with the ratio of ILI patients decreasing significantly from well above the baseline to below it. This decline is consistent across all age groups, indicating a general reduction in ILI incidence. Initially, the ratio of ILI patients was more than double the baseline threshold, suggesting a high level of ILI activity, which could have put a strain on healthcare resources. However, the recent figures falling below the baseline indicate a potential easing of the healthcare burden associated with ILI. The sharp decrease in ILI cases, particularly in the youngest and oldest age brackets, is noteworthy, as these groups are typically at higher risk for complications, hence the overall trend may suggest a decrease in the potential for severe outcomes and a lower impact on healthcare services.
