Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the number of respiratory specimens tested for influenza, with a peak at 42,526 tests in week 13 before a decline. Despite the variability in testing, the overall percentage of positive specimens has remained relatively stable, averaging 6.26%, with a slight increase observed in the percentage of positive Influenza B specimens over time. Influenza A positivity rates have generally decreased, reaching a peak of 0.20% in week 5 and then dropping to 0.05% by week 20, while Influenza B has seen a more pronounced rise in positivity, peaking at 0.22% in week 2 and increasing to 0.21% by week 18. The highest combined positivity rate for both strains was 0.29% in week 15, indicating a potential spike in cases that could have implications for healthcare resource allocation. The decline in the positivity rate to 0.21% in week 20 suggests a possible decrease in influenza activity, but continued monitoring is necessary to understand the trend and manage healthcare system preparedness.
