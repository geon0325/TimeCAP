Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a notable fluctuation in temperature, peaking during the afternoon hours consistent with diurnal patterns. Humidity levels have shown considerable variation, with extremely high values during the early morning hours, indicative of possible fog or marine layer influence, which is common for coastal cities like San Francisco. Air pressure has seen some fluctuations, with a significant drop at one point that could suggest the passage of a transient weather system, potentially affecting local weather conditions. Wind speeds have remained generally light throughout the period, with minimal impact on the city's weather, but changes in wind direction from predominantly westerly to varying degrees could influence coastal fog dispersion and temperature distribution. Overall, the weather in San Francisco has been relatively mild, but the fluctuating humidity and air pressure may have resulted in intermittent periods of fog and changing local weather patterns.
