Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a noticeable fluctuation in temperature, with a general decreasing trend during the early hours followed by a gradual increase towards the latter part of the day. Humidity levels exhibited significant variability, with peaks correlating with the cooler temperatures and lower values during the warmer periods, indicative of diurnal patterns. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with only minor fluctuations throughout the day, suggesting steady atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds varied modestly but were generally light to moderate, with an increase noted during the day's warmer phases, possibly contributing to the dispersal of humidity. The wind direction shifted from northeasterly to southerly before settling into a predominantly east-southeast orientation, which may have influenced the temperature and humidity variations observed in the region.
