Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a consistent air pressure with a slight decrease in the later hours which could indicate a change in the weather pattern. Temperature trends show a gradual increase throughout the day, reaching a peak in the late afternoon before beginning to cool down, which is typical for the region's coastal climate. Humidity levels were very high during the early hours, indicating a likelihood of fog or mist, but there was a significant drop in humidity later, which would have resulted in clearer conditions. Wind speeds varied but were generally light to moderate, with some hours of calm; however, the wind direction shifted considerably throughout the period, which could suggest the movement of a weather front through the area. Overall, these indicators suggest a typical weather pattern for San Francisco with the possibility of some atmospheric instability due to the variations in air pressure and wind direction.
