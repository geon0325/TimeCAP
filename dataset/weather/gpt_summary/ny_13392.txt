Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before tapering off slightly towards the evening. Relative humidity levels fluctuated, starting moderate, then increasing significantly during the day, and dropping to lower levels towards the evening, indicating a drier air mass moving into the area. Air pressure showed a slow but steady decrease throughout the period, suggesting an approaching weather system that could potentially bring changes in the weather pattern. Wind speeds varied, with a notable increase towards the late evening, and the predominant wind directions have been southerly, shifting slightly to a more southwesterly direction later on. These conditions, combined with the dipping air pressure and increased wind speeds, may signal the approach of a frontal system, possibly leading to unsettled weather in the near future.
