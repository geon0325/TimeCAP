Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a persistent increase in the ratio of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) patients across all age groups, with the most significant rise observed in the youngest (0-4 years) and school-age (5-24 years) cohorts. Although the overall percentage of ILI patients remains below the baseline threshold, the consistent uptrend suggests a potential escalation in ILI activity, which could lead to increased healthcare demands, particularly in pediatric and school-based healthcare services. The highest number of ILI patients was recorded in the most recent weeks, indicating a possible surge that warrants close monitoring. The consistent increase in the ratio of ILI patients, alongside the growing number of reported cases, could signal the beginning of an epidemic phase, necessitating preparedness and response measures within the healthcare system. Despite the current ratio being below the baseline level, the upward trend is crucial for healthcare planning and resource allocation to manage the potential rise in ILI cases effectively.
