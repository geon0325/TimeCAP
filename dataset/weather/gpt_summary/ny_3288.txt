Over the last 24 hours in New York City, temperatures have exhibited a rising trend, starting from moderate values and reaching warmer levels by the afternoon, before gradually cooling down towards the evening. Relative humidity levels have fluctuated but generally decreased through the day, which could have contributed to the perception of warmer temperatures in the afternoon as the air became drier. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, indicating a lack of significant weather systems moving through the area that would disrupt the current conditions. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with a slight increase observed later in the day, and the prevailing winds were predominantly southerly, occasionally shifting to more southwesterly and southeasterly directions. Given these conditions, the weather in New York City has been stable, but the slight uptick in wind speed towards the end of the period may indicate a minor change approaching.
