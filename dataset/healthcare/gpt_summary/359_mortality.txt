Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia relative to total deaths, with a peak of 9.15% in week 6 and a low of 6.36% in the final week. Despite these weekly variations, the overall trend indicates a slight decline in the mortality ratio, with the most recent value falling below the 20-week average of 7.84%. The number of deaths attributed to Influenza or Pneumonia combined has declined over the time period, from a high of 5779 in week 3 to 3430 in week 20. Total deaths have also shown a decreasing trend, from a high of 70168 in week 6 to 53973 in week 20. These trends suggest that the impact of Influenza and Pneumonia on overall mortality may be lessening, which could indicate a potential easing of the burden on healthcare resources dedicated to these conditions.
