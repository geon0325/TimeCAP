Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a notable diurnal temperature variation, with a significant increase during the day followed by a decrease towards the early hours. Humidity levels peaked in the early morning, indicating possible morning coolness or fog, but they decreased as temperatures rose, suggesting drier conditions during the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight decrease towards the evening, which is typical for diurnal atmospheric patterns and could be associated with the development of minor weather systems. Wind speeds were consistently light, which would not contribute significantly to heat dispersal or the development of large weather systems. Wind direction varied minimally, predominantly coming from the northeast, shifting towards easterly directions in the later hours, which might have contributed to the stability of the weather patterns observed.
