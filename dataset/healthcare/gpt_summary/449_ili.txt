Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable increase in the proportion of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases across all age groups, with the overall ILI patient ratio rising from 1.54% to 6.90%, well above the 2.9% benchmark indicative of a severe influenza situation. The most significant increases have been observed in the youngest (0-4 years) and oldest (65 years and above) age groups, with ILI cases nearly quintupling in the former and sextupling in the latter, pointing to a potentially higher burden on pediatric and geriatric healthcare services. The 5-24 and 25-49 age groups have also shown marked increases in ILI cases, reflecting widespread community transmission. This escalation has been steady and sharp, particularly from week 15 to week 20, where the ILI ratio has soared from 3.79% to 6.90%, suggesting the peak of the influenza season may not have been reached yet. Given these trends, healthcare facilities may face increased strain due to higher demand for medical care and resources, necessitating preparedness in managing a larger number of ILI patients, and potentially impacting other healthcare services due to the redistribution of efforts towards ILI management.
