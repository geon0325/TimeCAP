Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant fluctuation in the mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia in comparison to the total number of deaths, with a peak ratio of 19.40% in the fourth and fifth weeks far surpassing the 20-week average of 7.84%. This spike coincides with an unusually high total number of deaths during those weeks, suggesting a potential outbreak or seasonal surge in respiratory illnesses. Following this peak, there has been a gradual decline in both the total number of deaths and the deaths attributed to Influenza or Pneumonia, with the ratio decreasing to a low of 8.17% in the last week. Despite this decline, the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia to total deaths has consistently remained above the 20-week average, indicating a sustained impact on the healthcare system. The data suggests the need for continued public health vigilance and resources to manage and prevent respiratory illness-related mortality.
