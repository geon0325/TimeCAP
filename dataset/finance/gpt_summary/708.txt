Volatility, as measured by the VIX, remained relatively steady with minor fluctuations, ending slightly higher at 17.59, which may suggest a growing caution in the market. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 both experienced some volatility, with the Nikkei 225 showing a more pronounced upward movement towards the end, while the FTSE 100 ended slightly lower, potentially reflecting region-specific economic factors.

Exchange rates saw the US dollar strengthening against the Euro and Japanese Yen but remained almost unchanged against the Chinese Yuan, indicating shifts in currency strength that could impact international trade dynamics.
