Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the ratio of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a peak positivity of 18.27% in week 4, followed by a gradual decrease to 4.77% in week 20. Influenza A has been the predominant strain, reaching a high positivity rate of 14.99% in week 4, but this has decreased over time to 2.70% in the latest week. Meanwhile, Influenza B showed an increase in the initial weeks, peaking at a positivity rate of 6.93% in week 12, before declining to 2.07% in week 20. The overall trend indicates a downward trajectory in the positivity rates for both influenza strains, suggesting a potential easing of the influenza season. However, the healthcare system must remain vigilant as the cumulative demand for patient care due to influenza can still strain resources, and the possibility of future waves should be monitored.
