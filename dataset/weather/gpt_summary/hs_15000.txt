Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a slight upward trend in temperature, indicating a warm and possibly uncomfortable climate for residents and visitors. Humidity levels have shown a gradual decrease throughout the period, which may have offered some relief from the heat and potentially lessened the perception of warmth. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight fluctuation mid-period, suggesting stable weather conditions without significant changes in weather patterns. Wind speeds have been mostly light, with no significant gusts, ensuring calm conditions that may not have provided much respite from the heat. The wind direction was predominantly from the south-southeast, which is typical for Houston and may contribute to the transport of warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico into the area.
