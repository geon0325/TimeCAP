Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable increase in the proportion of deaths attributed to influenza or pneumonia, surpassing the average ratio of 7.84% by a significant margin. The data reflects a peak in the mortality ratio from these causes at 18.51% in week 13, followed by a decline, yet the latest figure remains high at 13.00% in week 20. The total number of deaths fluctuated, with a peak in week 10, suggesting a potential correlation with the rise in influenza and pneumonia mortality during that period. Notably, there was a sharp spike in influenza-related deaths in week 14, which coincided with a decrease in the overall mortality ratio, indicating a possible outbreak or increased virulence of influenza strains. The sustained high ratio of mortality due to these respiratory conditions could indicate a strain on healthcare resources and may necessitate a review of public health strategies to mitigate the impact of these illnesses.
