Over the past 24 hours in New York City, temperatures have experienced minor fluctuations, generally maintaining a cold trend indicative of clear, winter conditions. Humidity levels have varied but remained moderate, with a slight decrease towards the end of the period, which could suggest drier air moving into the area. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable, showing a slight increase mid-period, which is often associated with settled weather and is likely contributing to the current calm conditions. Wind speeds have been moderate with occasional higher gusts, and the prevailing winds have been predominantly from the west-northwest, which is typical for this region and could be responsible for the transport of colder air masses. The consistency in wind direction suggests a steady weather pattern without significant immediate changes expected.
