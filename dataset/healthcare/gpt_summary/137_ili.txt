The analysis of the last 20 weeks of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data reveals a concerning upward trend in the ratio of ILI patients, surpassing the baseline indicator in recent weeks, indicating a significant increase in influenza activity. The most substantial rise is observed in the older age groups, specifically among individuals aged 25 and above, with a notably sharp increase in those aged 65 or more. This escalation may strain healthcare resources, as increased ILI cases typically lead to higher demand for medical consultations, diagnostic testing, and potential hospitalizations. The heightened ILI activity also underscores the need for public health interventions, such as vaccination campaigns and awareness programs, to mitigate the impact on vulnerable populations. Continuous monitoring and preparedness planning are essential to address this upward trend and ensure adequate healthcare response capabilities.
