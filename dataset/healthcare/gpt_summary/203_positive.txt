Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable upward trend in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the average positive ratio of 6.26% being surpassed in the latter half of the period. The increase is more pronounced for Influenza B, which started at 2.10% and peaked at 17.59%, than for Influenza A, which began at 1.35% and reached a high of 10.06%. The peak of positive specimens occurred in the 18th week for both strains, with Influenza B constituting a greater proportion of positive cases than Influenza A throughout the entire period. The ratio of positive specimens surged from a baseline of under 3.5% in the initial weeks to over 22.5% by the 18th week, indicating a significant increase in influenza prevalence. This sustained rise in influenza cases could strain healthcare resources, necessitate increased vaccination and antiviral strategies, and warrants close monitoring for potential impact on public health services and patient care.
