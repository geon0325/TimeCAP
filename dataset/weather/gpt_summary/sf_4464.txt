Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature, demonstrating a cooling trend during the early hours, followed by a gradual increase towards the afternoon. Humidity levels were exceptionally high in the early hours, indicating the presence of considerable moisture in the air, but saw a significant decrease as the day progressed, suggesting a drier atmosphere towards the evening. Air pressure remained relatively stable but showed a slight overall decrease, which could imply a minor change in weather patterns such as an approaching weather system. Wind speeds varied modestly with periods of calm and breezes, and while these speeds are not indicative of severe weather, they contribute to the perceived temperature and dispersion of moisture. Wind direction shifted throughout the day, predominantly coming from the west, which is typical for coastal cities like San Francisco, and may influence the movement of marine air masses into the city.
