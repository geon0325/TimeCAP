Over the last 20 weeks, the data exhibits a noticeable upward trend in the ratio of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) patients, indicating a significant rise in ILI cases across all age groups. The increase surpassed the baseline threshold of 2.9%, reaching its peak in the middle of the observed period, which suggests a period of heightened healthcare demand, particularly with respect to resources allocated for ILI treatment and management. Notably, the age groups 0-4 and 5-24 years showed the largest increases in the number of ILI cases, highlighting a possible higher transmission rate or vulnerability within these younger populations. Following the peak, there has been a gradual decline in the ILI ratio, yet it remains above the baseline, indicating that ILI is still more prevalent than usual and continues to be a concern for the healthcare system. The sustained elevated levels of ILI cases may strain healthcare resources, necessitate continued public health vigilance, and could impact other healthcare services due to resource reallocation.
