Over the past 20 weeks, the overall number of patients presenting with Influenza-like Illness (ILI) has fluctuated, with a noticeable decrease in recent weeks across all age groups, reflecting a downtrend in ILI cases. Importantly, the ratio of ILI patients has consistently remained below the baseline threshold, indicating that the prevalence of ILI within the patient population is not at an alarming level currently. The age group of 25-49 years has shown the highest number of ILI cases, suggesting that adults in this age range may be more affected by ILI or more likely to seek medical care for such symptoms. Despite the gradual decline in ILI ratios, the healthcare system should continue monitoring these trends closely, as ILI activity can vary and potentially increase, necessitating preparedness for any potential surges. The data also underscores the importance of preventive measures and public health strategies targeted at the most affected age groups to mitigate the impact of ILI on the population and healthcare resources.
