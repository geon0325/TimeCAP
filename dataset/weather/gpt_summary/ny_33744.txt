Over the past 24 hours in New York City, temperatures showed a slight decrease during the night followed by a gradual increase throughout the day, indicating typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels varied, with an overall increase towards the latter part of the period, which could suggest a build-up of moisture in the air. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight increase in the middle of the time period, which generally signifies stable weather conditions. Wind speeds were consistently light and showed little variation, which is unlikely to contribute to significant wind chill effects or disrupt outdoor activities. The wind direction shifted from primarily northwest to north and then to west, which might have influenced the slight temperature fluctuations observed.
