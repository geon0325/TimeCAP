Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a marked diurnal variation in temperature with a peak during the afternoon hours, indicative of typical patterns for the region. Humidity levels have seen some fluctuations but remained high for the majority of the period, suggesting a presence of moisture in the air that could lead to fog formation, particularly during the cooler early morning and late evening hours. Air pressure has been relatively stable with a slight downward trend, which may indicate the approach of a weather system that could alter current conditions. Wind speeds have generally been gentle to moderate, with an increase during the day, which is common in coastal areas due to differential heating. The wind has been predominantly coming from the west-northwest, with occasional shifts, which is characteristic of the prevailing wind patterns for San Francisco and could contribute to variations in coastal fog density.
