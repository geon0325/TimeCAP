Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual decline in temperature, reaching its lowest point in the early morning before steadily climbing back up later in the day. Humidity levels varied widely, starting high, dipping midday, and then increasing again towards the evening, indicating the presence of moisture that could affect local weather conditions such as fog formation, particularly during the night and early morning hours. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight increase throughout the day, suggesting stable weather conditions without significant disturbances. Wind speeds were mostly light to gentle, with occasional moderate gusts, and the wind direction shifted from primarily northerly to a more variable pattern, including easterly and westerly winds. These conditions, combined with the local topography, could lead to varying microclimates across the city, affecting fog dispersion and temperature variations.
