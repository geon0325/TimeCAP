Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature followed by a significant increase towards the latter part of the period, indicative of typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels have been relatively high with a slight decrease during the hours when temperatures peaked, which is typical as warmer air can hold more moisture leading to lower relative humidity. Air pressure fluctuated slightly but showed a notable increase at one point, possibly signifying the movement of a high-pressure system through the area which could lead to more stable weather conditions. Wind speeds were moderate and varied throughout the day with some calmer periods, and the wind direction shifted significantly, starting from a westerly direction, showing variability towards northerly directions, and then settling into a more northerly to northeasterly flow. These wind changes could influence coastal conditions and potentially bring in marine air, affecting local weather patterns.
