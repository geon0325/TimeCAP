Over the last 24 hours, New York City has experienced relatively stable temperatures with only minor fluctuations, maintaining a generally cold environment consistent with late autumn or winter conditions. Humidity levels have seen some variation, notably decreasing in the afternoon but significantly increasing in the late-night hours, which could lead to a feeling of increased chill or potential for fog development. The air pressure has been steadily rising throughout the day, indicative of improving weather conditions and possibly leading to clearer skies. Wind speeds have been moderate with occasional gusts, and wind direction has been predominantly westerly to northwesterly, which is typical for the region and may contribute to the transport of cooler air masses into the area. Overall, the current trends suggest stable but cold weather, with a gradual clearing pattern possibly emerging due to the increasing air pressure.
