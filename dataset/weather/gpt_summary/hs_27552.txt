Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a gradual increase in temperature from the early hours to the late afternoon, followed by a slight decrease toward the evening, indicating a typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels experienced significant fluctuation, starting moderate, increasing significantly during the early morning, and then gradually decreasing towards the evening, suggesting the possibility of morning dew or fog that cleared as the day progressed. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with a slight increase toward the end, which could suggest the arrival of a high-pressure system, typically associated with clearer skies and calmer weather. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with an increase in the latter part of the day that could contribute to a wind chill effect, making it feel cooler than the actual temperature. Additionally, wind direction varied significantly, beginning with easterly winds and shifting to a more northerly and then southerly direction before settling into a southeastern pattern, which could influence the transportation of moisture and air masses into the region.
