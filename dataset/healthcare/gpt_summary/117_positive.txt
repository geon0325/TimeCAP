The time-series data indicates a substantial decrease in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza over the last 20 weeks, with a peak ratio of positive specimens at 27.37% in week 4, followed by a steady decline to 3.17% in the most recent week. Influenza A showed a more pronounced decrease compared to Influenza B, with its positive specimen ratio dropping from 21.23% to 1.35%, while Influenza B decreased from 4.75% to 1.81% in the same period. Despite the overall decline, Influenza Bâ€™s proportion of the total positive cases increased as the season progressed, suggesting a shift in the predominant circulating influenza strain. The declining trend in positive cases suggests that the influenza season may be waning, potentially reducing the burden on healthcare resources. However, the healthcare system should remain vigilant and continue to monitor the data, as influenza trends can be unpredictable and resurgence is a possibility that could impact healthcare delivery and resource allocation.
