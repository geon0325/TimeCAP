Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have exhibited a typical diurnal pattern with a peak during the afternoon hours, indicating warm and potentially uncomfortable conditions for the residents. Humidity levels have fluctuated significantly, with notably high values during the night and early morning, which could have led to periods of mugginess, especially when the temperature was also high. Air pressure has remained relatively stable, indicating a lack of significant weather systems moving through the area that might otherwise cause more variable weather conditions. Wind speeds have been mostly light to moderate but increased towards the latter part of the period, which may have provided some relief from the heat. The wind direction has varied, with a general preference for southerly to southwesterly winds, which is typical for bringing in warm air from the Gulf of Mexico to the Houston area.
