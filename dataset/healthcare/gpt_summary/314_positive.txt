Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant increase in the proportion of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a notable peak in the ratio of positive specimens reaching 6.23% in week 10, closely approaching the average positivity rate of 6.26%. The data indicates a predominance of Influenza A, which shows a higher positivity rate compared to Influenza B, culminating at 4.60% in the final week compared to 0.05% for Influenza B. The upward trend in positive cases, particularly for Influenza A, suggests a potentially escalating influenza season that could strain healthcare resources if it continues. Despite a decline in the number of specimens tested after week 12, the positivity rate for Influenza A has continued to increase, indicating a higher prevalence of the virus among those tested. Healthcare providers should be alert to this trend and may need to allocate more resources for influenza diagnosis, treatment, and vaccination campaigns to manage the increasing burden of influenza infections.
