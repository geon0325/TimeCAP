Over the last 20 weeks, the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia to the total number of deaths has fluctuated but generally remained below the 20-week average of 7.84%, suggesting a lower impact of these illnesses relative to other causes of death during this period. In the most recent week, there was a slight increase to 5.75% from a low of 4.90% in week 14, indicating a potential uptick in the impact of these respiratory illnesses. The total number of deaths peaked in the last week at 53,763, which could reflect seasonal variations or other epidemiological factors. Deaths from pneumonia outnumber those from influenza significantly, with pneumonia deaths ranging from 2,601 to 3,065, while influenza deaths remained relatively low, peaking at 24 in the final week. These trends could indicate a relatively stable pattern for influenza while suggesting a need for continued monitoring and response strategies for pneumonia within the healthcare system.
