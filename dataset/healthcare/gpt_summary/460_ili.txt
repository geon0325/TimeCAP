Over the past 20 weeks, Influenza-like Illness (ILI) rates have consistently exceeded the severity benchmark of 2.9% of total patient visits, indicating a sustained high level of influenza activity. The peak of ILI incidence occurred between weeks 6 and 7, with rates reaching a maximum of 6.90%, which is more than double the benchmark, suggesting a significant strain on healthcare resources during that period. Since then, there has been a gradual decline in ILI rates, yet they remain above the severity threshold, with the latest week reporting a rate of 3.40%. Notably, the highest number of ILI cases has been reported in the 5-24 age group, followed by the 25-49 age group, indicating that these populations may be driving the transmission of influenza. The consistent excess of the severity benchmark underscores the need for ongoing public health measures, vaccination efforts, and preparedness in healthcare settings to manage the demand and prevent further spread.
