Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature followed an expected diurnal pattern, with a gradual increase from the early morning hours to a peak in the late afternoon before cooling again. Humidity levels were high throughout the period, even reaching saturation at times overnight, which could have led to foggy conditions or precipitation. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight decreasing trend, indicating stable weather conditions but perhaps a minor system moving through the area. Wind speeds varied, remaining light overnight and increasing significantly during the day, suggesting that breezier conditions prevailed in the afternoon. The wind direction was predominantly southeasterly, shifting to a more southerly direction in the evening, which is typical for Houston and could have contributed to the transport of moisture and warmth from the Gulf of Mexico inland.
