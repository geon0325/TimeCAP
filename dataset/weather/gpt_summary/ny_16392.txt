Over the past 24 hours in New York City, there has been a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before stabilizing towards the evening. Humidity levels showed a fluctuating pattern, with a significant increase during the early morning hours indicative of possible morning dew or fog formation, then decreasing sharply as temperatures rose. The air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with a noticeable increase mid-afternoon, suggesting a potential shift in weather patterns that could lead to clearer conditions. Wind speeds varied, with calmer winds observed during the day which then picked up in the evening, possibly contributing to the dispersion of any daytime urban heat accumulation. The wind direction was predominantly westerly to southwesterly, with some variability, which is typical for this region and may have influenced the distribution of any maritime air masses coming inland.
