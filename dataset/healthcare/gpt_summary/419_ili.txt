Over the past 20 weeks, the proportion of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases among all patients has consistently remained below the 2.9% threshold, indicating a milder influenza season when benchmarked against this particular criterion. The highest ILI patient ratio was observed in the initial weeks (2.71% in week 1), with a gradual decline to 1.94% by week 20, reflecting a decreasing trend in ILI prevalence. The age group 5-24 consistently reported the highest numbers of ILI cases, suggesting that this demographic may be driving the majority of influenza transmission within the community. There has been a noticeable decrease in the number of ILI cases across all age groups, with the most significant reduction observed in the 0-4 age group, from a peak of 13,478 cases to 9,568, indicating a potential easing of the burden on pediatric healthcare services. Despite the number of ILI cases staying below the severity threshold, healthcare systems should continue monitoring these trends, especially in younger populations, to manage resources effectively and prepare for possible future increases.
