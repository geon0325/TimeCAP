Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a noticeable warming trend with temperatures rising significantly, reaching a peak during the late afternoon before cooling slightly towards the evening. Humidity levels have varied but remained high, which could contribute to a muggy feeling, especially when the temperature was at its highest. Air pressure experienced some fluctuations, with a notable increase during the early morning hours, which could suggest the passage of a weather front. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a period of higher speeds in the early morning, possibly indicating the presence of a localized weather system. Wind directions have been variable with a predominance of westerly winds, shifting to northerly and then to easterly, which may affect coastal conditions and potentially bring in marine air to the region.
