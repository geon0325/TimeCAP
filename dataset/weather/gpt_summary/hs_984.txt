Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced a moderate rise in temperature, entering into a warm phase that peaked in the late afternoon before slightly decreasing towards the evening. Relative humidity levels exhibited considerable variation, with a notable spike during the cooler early morning hours, indicative of a muggy start to the day, followed by a decrease as temperatures rose, and then an increase again in the evening. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with a slight fluctuation that may have had a minimal impact on weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally moderate but showed a significant increase during the afternoon, potentially contributing to a brief period of gustier conditions. The wind direction was primarily from the south to southeast, which is typical for Houston and often associated with warmer and more humid air being drawn inland from the Gulf of Mexico.
