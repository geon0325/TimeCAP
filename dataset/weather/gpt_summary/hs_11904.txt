Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has shown a gradual decreasing trend, moving from moderate values to noticeably cooler conditions overnight. Humidity levels have fluctuated significantly, with several instances where the air reached full saturation, suggesting the possibility of fog or mist formation, particularly when combined with the calm wind conditions observed during the same periods. The air pressure has remained relatively stable, with a slight increase observed, which typically indicates stable weather patterns and may suggest a continuation of current conditions in the short term. Wind speeds have varied, with a notable increase in the last few hours, and a shift in wind direction from primarily easterly to more northerly, which could influence temperature and humidity levels. Overall, the combination of cooling temperatures, high humidity, and increasing wind speeds could lead to brisk and potentially damp weather conditions in Houston.
