Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable downtrend in the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia to the total number of deaths, starting at 8.49% and decreasing to 5.86%, which is below the average ratio of 7.84%. Despite the total number of deaths fluctuating, there was a downward trend from 58,479 to 50,617. Deaths specifically from influenza showed a substantial decrease from 545 to 10, indicating a significant reduction in influenza-related mortality during the analyzed period. Pneumonia-related deaths also declined but less steeply, from 4,419 to 2,954. This overall reduction could imply effective seasonal illness management and vaccination strategies, but it also necessitates continuous monitoring to manage potential healthcare system burdens and prevent potential outbreaks.
