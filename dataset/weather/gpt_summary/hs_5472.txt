Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have exhibited a general upward trend, reaching their peak in the late afternoon, which is indicative of typical diurnal variation. Relative humidity showed significant fluctuations, with instances of complete saturation, possibly leading to early morning fog or mist, followed by a gradual decrease as temperatures rose. Air pressure remained relatively stable with only minor variations, suggesting a steady atmospheric condition without the immediate influence of any strong weather systems. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with some increase towards the latter part of the period, which could contribute to a slight cooling effect despite the warm temperatures. The wind direction was predominantly from the south, which is common for Houston and can be associated with bringing increased moisture and warmth from the Gulf of Mexico into the area.
