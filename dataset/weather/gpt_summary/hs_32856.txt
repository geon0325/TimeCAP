Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have exhibited a typical diurnal pattern, peaking during the afternoon hours and reaching a minimum in the early morning. Humidity levels have fluctuated significantly, with the highest values recorded in the pre-dawn hours, indicating a likelihood of morning mist or fog, which would have dissipated as temperatures rose. The air pressure has remained relatively stable with only minor fluctuations, suggesting a period of settled weather without significant frontal activity. Wind speeds have been generally light to moderate, increasing towards the end of the period, which could contribute to a refreshing breeze but may also transport moisture leading to potential cloud development. Wind direction has varied throughout the day, primarily from the south to southeast, which is typical for Houston and can bring in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, affecting local humidity and precipitation patterns.
