Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, followed by a slight decrease as the day progressed into night, consistent with diurnal patterns. Humidity levels have shown significant fluctuation, with a notable peak during the early hours, which could have contributed to a feeling of mugginess and potentially impacted visibility. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with a slight drop noted in the later hours, which could indicate an approaching weather system.
