Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures exhibited a typical diurnal pattern, starting off cooler in the early hours before warming significantly towards the afternoon. Humidity levels varied, with a noticeable increase during the cooler early morning hours, which is common as cooler air can hold less moisture. Air pressure decreased steadily throughout the period, suggesting a possible change in weather patterns or the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds were generally light, increasing slightly during the day, which could have provided some relief from the afternoon warmth. The wind direction showed variability, with a shift from easterly to southerly directions, then stabilizing from the southeast, which could influence moisture and temperature levels in the region.
