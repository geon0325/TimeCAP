Over the last 20 weeks, the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) rates have consistently remained well below the baseline threshold used to determine an influenza outbreak, indicating a relatively mild influenza season thus far. A gradual increase in the ratio of ILI patients was observed through the middle of the time series, reaching its peak before declining in recent weeks. The age group of 25-49 consistently showed the highest number of ILI patients, suggesting that working-age adults were the most affected demographic during this period. Notably, the oldest age group (65 and above) reported the lowest number of ILI patients, yet an increase in their numbers could potentially place a significant burden on healthcare services due to the higher risk of complications in this population. Although the ILI rates are currently below the concern threshold, continuous monitoring is essential, especially as the numbers can fluctuate and potentially put strain on healthcare resources.
