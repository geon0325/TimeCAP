Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the number of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a peak positivity rate of 24.73% by week 7, before a steady decline to 4.35% by week 20. While both Influenza A and B were present, Influenza A consistently showed a higher rate of positive specimens, peaking at 20.21% in week 5, yet dropping to 1.40% by the end of the period. In contrast, Influenza B peaked later at 11.26% in week 12 and demonstrated a slower decline to 2.95% by week 20. The overall decreasing trend in positivity rates suggests a waning influenza season; however, the persistent presence of influenza, especially type B, still poses a risk and requires continued monitoring and healthcare preparedness. The peak of activity around weeks 5 to 7, followed by a decline, is consistent with typical influenza seasonal patterns, which could help healthcare providers anticipate resource allocation for future seasons.
