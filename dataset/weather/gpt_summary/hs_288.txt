Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have experienced a diurnal cycle, starting off warm in the early hours, cooling slightly during the night, and then rising significantly during the day, with the highest temperatures occurring in the late afternoon. Humidity levels were generally high, peaking at complete saturation at one point, which could indicate the presence of fog or dew; however, the humidity dropped considerably during the period of peak daytime temperatures. Air pressure has shown a gradual decline throughout the period, which is often associated with the approach of a low-pressure system that could lead to changing weather patterns, including the possibility of precipitation or storms. Wind speeds varied, with calm winds at one point, but there were periods of more brisk winds later in the day. The wind direction has been predominantly from the south to southeast, which in Houston often brings in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, potentially contributing to higher humidity and chances of rain.
