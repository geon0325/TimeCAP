Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual decrease in temperature from a high during the afternoon to a cooler night, with the lowest temperatures recorded around dawn. Humidity levels varied significantly, with peaks suggesting the presence of moisture in the air, potentially leading to foggy conditions, especially when coinciding with cooler temperatures. Air pressure showed minor fluctuations but overall remained relatively stable, indicating no significant weather systems impacting the area. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with some gusts occurring, and wind direction shifted predominantly from northerly to westerly, which is typical for coastal regions like San Francisco and could influence coastal fog development. The combination of these factors indicates a relatively stable weather pattern with standard variations expected in a maritime climate.
