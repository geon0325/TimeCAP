Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility but ended on an upward trend, closing higher by approximately 3% from the beginning. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, had increased mid-period, suggesting investor uncertainty, but has since decreased, indicating a return to more stable market conditions. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 indices have experienced fluctuations; however, both closed higher, with the Nikkei showing a slight positive trend and the FTSE recovering significantly after a sharp drop. Gold Futures have seen a decline in price, suggesting a shift in investor preference towards riskier assets, while Crude Oil Futures recovered from a mid-period dip to close higher, potentially indicating increased energy demand or production cuts. Finally, the major currency pairs of EUR/USD and USD/JYP have remained relatively stable, whereas USD/CNY has shown a slight depreciation in the Yuan, which could be reflective of trade sentiment or policy actions by China's central bank.
