Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual rise in temperature, transitioning from cooler conditions in the early hours to noticeably warmer temperatures by late afternoon, before stabilizing towards the evening. Humidity levels started relatively high but showed a decreasing trend throughout the day, indicating drier air moving into the area. Air pressure has been on a steady decline, which could suggest the approach of a weather system that might lead to changing weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally light but picked up significantly later in the day, with the wind direction remaining predominantly from the south. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and falling air pressure, along with increased wind speeds, could signal the potential for dynamic weather patterns, including the possibility of a frontal system affecting the region.
