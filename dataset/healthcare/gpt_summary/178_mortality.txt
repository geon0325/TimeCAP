Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a fluctuating but generally decreasing trend in the proportion of deaths attributable to influenza or pneumonia when compared to the total number of deaths. The ratio of mortality from these respiratory illnesses peaked at 10.72% in week 10 and has since steadily declined to a low of 5.20% by week 18, sitting slightly higher at 5.54% in the final week of the reported period. Absolute numbers of deaths from pneumonia have also followed a downward trajectory, with a notable drop from 6840 deaths in week 9 to 2992 deaths in week 20. Conversely, deaths from influenza show a slight increasing trend in the last three weeks, despite being relatively low throughout the 20-week period. These patterns may suggest an overall decrease in the impact of pneumonia on mortality rates and potentially a changing dynamic in the prevalence or severity of respiratory illnesses, which could influence healthcare resource allocation and public health strategies.
