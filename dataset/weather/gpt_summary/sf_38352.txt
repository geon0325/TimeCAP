Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have remained relatively stable with a slight fluctuation, indicating no significant warm or cold trends. Humidity levels have risen significantly towards the end of the period, suggesting an increased chance of fog or mist, particularly in the early morning hours, which is common for the city. Air pressure experienced a gradual decrease followed by a slight increase, which could be associated with the arrival and subsequent weakening of a low-pressure system. Wind speeds increased to a peak before diminishing again, and the predominant wind direction was southerly, shifting slightly to the west later on. This combination of higher humidity, changing air pressure, and variable winds could lead to cooler and potentially damp conditions, typical of San Francisco's microclimates.
