Over the past 24 hours in New York City, the temperature experienced a gradual rise, indicating a warming trend that peaked in the latter part of the observed period. Humidity levels were high in the early hours but showed a notable decline as the day progressed, which could suggest the presence of a drying atmosphere possibly associated with the increase in temperature. Air pressure decreased slightly over the course of the day, which might be indicative of an approaching weather system that has the potential to alter current conditions. Wind speeds varied, with periods of calm interspersed with occasional gusts; the latter part of the day saw a slight increase in wind activity. The wind direction was predominantly from the south to southeast but shifted more towards the southwest later, which could contribute to the transport of warmer air masses into the area.
