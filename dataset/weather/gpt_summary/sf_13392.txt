Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual rise in temperature, reaching its peak in the latter part of the period, indicative of a typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels fluctuated moderately but remained relatively high throughout, suggesting a persistent presence of moisture in the air, which could contribute to a feeling of mugginess or potential fog development, especially during the cooler morning or evening hours. Air pressure showed a slight overall increase until the last few hours, when a significant drop occurred, possibly signaling an approaching weather system that could lead to changes in weather patterns, such as increased chances of precipitation or storms. Wind speed varied, with periods of calmer conditions interspersed with moderate breezes; a sudden increase in wind speed towards the end of the period could be associated with the incoming weather system indicated by the drop in pressure. The wind direction was predominantly westerly, with some variability, which is typical for coastal San Francisco, although notable shifts in direction occurred, potentially reflecting the influence of local topography or the larger-scale movement of the weather system.
