Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, culminating in notably warmer conditions by the end of the observed period. Relative humidity levels have seen fluctuations but generally decreased as the temperature rose, which is typical as warmer air can hold more moisture before it's perceived as humid. Air pressure has shown a slight downward trend, indicating a potential change in weather patterns, such as the approach of a weather front or system. Wind speeds have mostly been light to moderate with some variability, but without any significant gusts that would suggest stormy conditions. The wind direction was predominantly calm or from the north, with occasional shifts, suggesting a relatively stable air flow pattern for the region.
