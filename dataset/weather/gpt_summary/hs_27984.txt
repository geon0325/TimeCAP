Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced relatively stable temperatures, maintaining conditions that can be described as mild to warm. Humidity levels have shown some fluctuation but remained predominantly high, suggesting a muggy atmosphere which is common for the region. Pressure readings dipped slightly in the latter part of the period, potentially indicating the approach of a weather system that could lead to changes such as increased wind speeds or precipitation. Speaking of wind, there was a noticeable increase in wind speed towards the end of the 24-hour period, which aligns with the drop in air pressure. The wind direction was primarily from the south to southeast, which is typical for Houston and can contribute to the transport of moist Gulf air into the area, reinforcing the high humidity levels experienced.
