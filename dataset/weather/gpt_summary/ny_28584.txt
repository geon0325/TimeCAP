Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature which indicates a warming trend, although the temperatures remained well below freezing throughout the day. The humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, with particularly high readings during the coldest part of the early morning, suggesting the possibility of frost or ice formation. Air pressure remained relatively high and stable, which is typically associated with settled weather conditions, but there was a notable dip towards the evening. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate and showed an increase later in the day, with the direction shifting predominantly from westerly to southwesterly. This shift in wind direction, combined with rising temperatures, could suggest the approach of a warmer air mass moving into the area.
