Over the past 20 weeks, the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia to the total number of deaths has shown an increasing trend, rising from 5.31% to 6.83%, which is below the average ratio of 7.84%. The absolute number of deaths from Influenza has seen a significant rise in the latter weeks, jumping from 33 deaths in the first week to 258 deaths in the last week. Pneumonia-related deaths have also increased from 2936 to 3951 over the same period. The total number of deaths varied weekly but showed a general upward trend, starting at 55,934 and reaching 61,607 by the end of the 20 weeks. This data indicates that while the overall mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia is still below the average, the sharp increase in deaths from these causes, especially in recent weeks, could signal an emerging healthcare challenge that requires close monitoring and potentially increased resources for prevention and treatment.
