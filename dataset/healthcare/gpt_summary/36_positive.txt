Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a fluctuating trend in the ratio of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a notable increase in the latter weeks, exceeding the average positive ratio of 6.26%. The number of specimens tested has risen significantly, indicating potentially increased surveillance or more widespread infection, with the highest testing volume in the last week at 15,312. Influenza A has seen a recent surge in positive cases, peaking at 1.01% in week 11 and climbing to 0.93% by week 20, while Influenza B showed higher positivity in the earlier weeks, with a peak ratio of 1.12%, but has remained relatively stable thereafter. Despite fluctuations, the overall positivity ratio has not exceeded 1.78%, suggesting that while there is an upward trend, the current levels are still below the average positivity rate. This data suggests a need for continued monitoring of influenza trends and potentially increased healthcare resource allocation to manage the rising number of cases.
