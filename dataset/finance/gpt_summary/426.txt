Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a general upward trend, closing higher at 3419.44 from an initial 3339.19, indicating a positive momentum in the US stock market. The VIX, commonly known as the fear gauge, has remained elevated but relatively stable, moving within a narrow range of 25.59 to 29.71, suggesting a consistent level of market volatility and investor uncertainty. International markets have shown mixed movements; the Nikkei 225 has experienced slight fluctuations but ended marginally higher, while the FTSE 100 has seen a downward trend, particularly with a significant drop mid-period, possibly reflecting ongoing economic concerns in Europe.

Commodity prices have varied with Gold Futures declining from 1954.20 to 1883.60, pointing towards a reduced appeal for safe-haven assets, while Crude Oil Futures have been volatile but closed slightly higher, which may indicate cautious optimism about economic recovery. Currency markets have seen the Euro and the Japanese Yen largely maintain their strength against the US Dollar, while the USD/CNY pair has remained stable, suggesting current exchange rates are reflecting a balance in trade expectations and currency market sentiments.
