Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in the mortality ratio of Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, with a peak of 10.72% in week 6 and a notable decrease to 5.20% by week 14, followed by a slight upward trend to 5.63% in week 20. The total number of deaths started at 59,702 in week 1 and showed a slight rising trend until week 4 (64,122), before stabilizing around the 54,000 to 64,000 range for the remaining weeks. Deaths from pneumonia constituted the majority of the Influenza or Pneumonia category, with an initial high of 6,840 in week 5, decreasing significantly to 2,714 by week 14, and then experiencing a mild increase to 3,106 by week 20. Influenza-related deaths remained low in comparison, with a maximum of 39 deaths in the final week, suggesting a potential late seasonal increase. These trends indicate a mid-period alleviation in pneumonia-related mortality, which may have eased the burden on healthcare systems, but the recent increases in influenza mortality could signal a need for increased vigilance and preparedness for potential rises in respiratory illnesses.
