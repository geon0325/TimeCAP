Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, reaching its lowest point in the early morning before slightly rising again towards the evening. Humidity levels have been quite variable, starting at moderate values, increasing significantly overnight, which is typical due to cooler temperatures and possibly indicative of some marine influence, before leveling off during the day. Air pressure showed a slight declining trend throughout the day, with a noticeable drop in the afternoon, which could suggest the passage of a weak weather system through the area. Wind speeds were generally light, but there was a period of gusty conditions in the afternoon, which could have been associated with the aforementioned drop in air pressure. Wind direction varied widely, suggesting changing wind patterns possibly due to the local topography and passing weather systems.
