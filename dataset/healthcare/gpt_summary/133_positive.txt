Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant fluctuation in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a notable decline from an 8% positivity rate in week 1 to a low of 0.76% in week 16, followed by a recent uptick to 1.75% in week 20. The data shows that Influenza B has been more prevalent than Influenza A throughout the period, though both subtypes have seen a decrease in positivity rates with Influenza A reaching its lowest at 0.51% in week 16 and Influenza B at 0.19% in week 11. However, the last four weeks indicate a rising trend in the positivity rates for both Influenza A and B, suggesting a potential resurgence of influenza activity. Despite this increase, the overall positivity rate remains below the initial average of 6.26%, indicating that the current influenza activity is still relatively low. The healthcare system should monitor these trends closely, as the recent increases could signal the beginning of an upward trend that may require increased vigilance and resource allocation.
