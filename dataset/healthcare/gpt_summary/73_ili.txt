Over the last 20 weeks, the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) activity has remained consistently below the baseline threshold necessary to indicate an influenza epidemic, with the ratio of ILI patients demonstrating a gradual increase over time. The highest ILI patient ratios were observed in the most recent weeks, suggesting a potential uptick in ILI cases that might require closer monitoring. The age group 0-4 consistently reported the greatest number of ILI cases, highlighting the vulnerability of young children to ILI and the need for targeted public health interventions in this demographic. While all age groups experienced an increase in ILI cases towards the end of the 20-week period, the growth rate was not uniform across the age groups, indicating that certain populations are more affected than others. This rising trend in ILI activity, particularly if sustained or increasing further, could lead to heightened demands on healthcare services, emphasizing the importance of preventive measures and readiness in the healthcare system to manage potential surges in patient volume.
