Over the last 20 weeks, the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia to total deaths has fluctuated between 5.36% and 6.50%, remaining below the average ratio of 7.84%. While the total number of deaths has generally increased from 50,127 to 54,607, the deaths from Influenza have seen a considerable relative increase in the final week, jumping to 34 deaths from a low of 3. Deaths from Pneumonia have also shown an upward trend, escalating to 3,516 in the last recorded week from an earlier count of 2,755. This rise in mortality from Pneumonia and Influenza comes despite the overall mortality ratio from these causes being below the average, suggesting a potential increase in other causes of death or an overall increase in the total number of deaths. These trends may indicate a growing burden on healthcare resources dedicated to respiratory illnesses and could signal a need for increased vigilance and resource allocation in this area.
