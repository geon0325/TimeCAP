Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have experienced a slight but steady increase, indicative of a warming trend. Humidity levels remained high throughout the period, which, combined with the temperature rise, could have contributed to a muggy and uncomfortable atmosphere. Air pressure was relatively stable with a negligible fluctuation, suggesting a period of settled weather without any significant frontal systems passing through the area. Wind speed showed a minor uptick later in the period, pointing to an increase in wind activity that could be associated with the arrival of different weather patterns. The wind direction shifted gradually from southeasterly to south-southwesterly, which could imply a change in the source region of the air mass affecting Houston, potentially bringing in different weather conditions.
