Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a slight increase in temperature followed by a decrease, suggesting a fluctuating but overall cooling trend. Humidity levels showed minor variations, maintaining a relatively high range which, combined with the cooling temperatures, could have led to a damp and chilly atmosphere. Air pressure increased steadily throughout the period, indicating a potential shift toward more stable weather conditions. Wind speeds remained mostly constant and moderate, with only a slight decrease towards the end of the period, which would not have caused significant changes in the day-to-day weather experience. The wind direction was predominantly from the northwest, with a slight shift towards the west-northwest later on, which is consistent with the passage of a weather front across the region.
