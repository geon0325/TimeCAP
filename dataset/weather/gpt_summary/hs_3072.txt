Over the last 24 hours in Houston, there has been a gradual decrease in temperature, suggesting a cooling trend. Humidity levels remained high for the majority of the period, often reaching saturation, which could indicate the presence of fog or mist, especially when coupled with the low wind speeds observed during several hours. Air pressure experienced some fluctuations but showed a significant increase in the final hour, potentially signaling the approach of a high-pressure system that may lead to clearer skies. Wind speeds varied, with a notable increase towards the latter part of the period, which could help to disperse humidity and improve visibility. The wind direction was variable but predominantly came from a southeasterly direction earlier on, shifting towards a more northerly direction by the end of the period.
