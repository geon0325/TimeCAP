Over the last 24 hours in New York City, there has been a noticeable increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before gradually declining as night approached. Humidity levels experienced a significant drop during the day, likely contributing to a perception of milder conditions despite the rising temperatures. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight fluctuation, indicating no major weather fronts moving through the area. Wind speeds varied, with calmer winds in the early morning hours and increased velocities towards the evening, suggesting a potentially brisker night ahead. The wind direction shifted throughout the day from northeasterly to predominantly northwesterly by the end of the 24-hour period, which could bring cooler air from those directions into the city.
