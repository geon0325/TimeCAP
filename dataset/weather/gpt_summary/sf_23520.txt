In the last 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual decline in temperature, starting relatively warm but cooling significantly towards the early morning hours. Humidity levels showed an increasing trend overnight, which is typical as temperatures drop, reaching near saturation in the early hours which could have led to fog formation or dew. Air pressure remained relatively stable and high throughout the period, suggesting stable weather conditions without significant disturbances. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a slight increase towards the end of the analyzed period, which could contribute to a wind chill effect, making it feel cooler than actual temperatures. The wind direction was predominantly from the west to the northwest, which is characteristic of the region's maritime influence and could be responsible for bringing in cooler air from the ocean.
