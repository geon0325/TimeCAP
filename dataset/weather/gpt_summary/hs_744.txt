Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a notable rise in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before a slight decline towards the evening. Humidity levels showed significant variation, with saturation occurring during the early hours and a marked decrease following the temperature peak, indicating a possible transition from cooler, damp conditions to a warmer and drier atmosphere. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight uptick in the middle of the period before a modest drop, which could suggest the presence of a high-pressure system that gradually weakened. Wind conditions were mostly calm with a few periods of light breeze; wind direction was variable but predominantly came from the south to the southwest when wind speeds were recorded. The combination of rising temperatures, fluctuating humidity, and stable pressure with calm winds suggests a warm, potentially muggy day followed by a clearer and drier evening in Houston.
