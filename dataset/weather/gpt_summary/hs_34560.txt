Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a subtle increase in temperature, indicating a warming trend as the day progressed, which is typical for the region. Humidity levels were notably high, especially during the nighttime and early morning hours, reaching saturation at several points, which could have led to foggy conditions or a heavy dew. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with only minor fluctuations indicating no significant weather fronts or storms passing through the area. Wind speeds were generally light and variable, with a slight increase towards the end of the period, which is unlikely to have a major impact on the weather. The wind direction shifted throughout the day from westerly to northerly and finally to northeasterly, which is consistent with a passing high-pressure system and could lead to clearer skies if it persists.
