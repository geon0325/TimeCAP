Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a fluctuating trend in the number of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a noticeable increase in recent weeks. Influenza A has shown a slight rise from 1.40% to 1.48% in positive specimen ratios, while Influenza B has experienced a more significant decline from 2.95% to 0.72%, with a minor uptick in the last week. The overall ratio of positive specimens has seen a decrease from its initial value of 4.35% to a low of 1.34%, before rising again to 2.20% in the most recent week. The number of specimens tested has steadily increased, reaching a peak in the last week at 15,532, which could indicate a growing concern for respiratory illnesses and a possible strain on testing resources. This data suggests a dynamic pattern in influenza prevalence, with a current upswing that healthcare providers should monitor closely for potential increases in healthcare demand and inform resource allocation strategies.
