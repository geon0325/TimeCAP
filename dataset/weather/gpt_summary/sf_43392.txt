Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have fluctuated, showing a cooling trend during the night followed by a gradual increase after sunrise, which is typical of the coastal Mediterranean climate. Humidity levels have seen significant variation, peaking during the early morning hours, which likely led to the formation of morning fog that is characteristic of the region, before dropping considerably towards the end of the period, suggesting clearer conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with only a slight increase in the middle of the period, indicating a period of stable weather without the immediate likelihood of significant weather disturbances. Wind speeds were generally moderate but showed some variability, with occasional gusts that could have contributed to a wind chill effect, making it feel cooler than actual temperatures, especially during the evening and nighttime. The wind direction was predominantly from the west to the southwest, which is common for San Francisco and is influenced by the oceanic currents and geographic layout of the region.
