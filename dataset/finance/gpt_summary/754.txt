Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has experienced a downward trend, falling from 4793.06 to 4349.93, indicating a potential shift towards a bearish market sentiment. This is further supported by the increase in the VIX (Volatility Index), which rose from 16.95 to 31.96, suggesting heightened market volatility and investor uncertainty. In contrast, the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 have shown more resilience, with the Nikkei experiencing a slight decline and the FTSE 100 even posting some gains towards the end of the period. Gold Futures have seen an uptrend, moving from 1805.10 to 1829.90, potentially reflecting a flight to safety among investors during times of market stress. Meanwhile, Crude Oil Futures have increased from 76.56 to 87.35, which could indicate expectations of economic recovery or potential supply constraints, and the exchange rates have remained relatively stable, with the EUR/USD and USD/CNY showing marginal fluctuations, suggesting that currency markets have not reacted as strongly to the equity market movements.
