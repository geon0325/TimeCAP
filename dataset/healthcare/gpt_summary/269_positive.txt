Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a gradual decline in the total number of respiratory specimens tested for influenza, with a notable decrease from 42,526 in week 1 to 30,238 in week 20. Concurrently, there has been a consistent downward trend in the number of positive specimens for both Influenza A and B, with Influenza A positive cases decreasing from 31 to 8, and Influenza B from 65 to 13 by the end of the 20-week period. Despite these declines, the ratios of positive specimens for both strains have also decreased, but they have stayed relatively low, with the overall positivity ratio dropping from 0.23% to 0.07% by week 20. The average positivity rate over the period (6.26%) is higher than the majority of the weekly reported rates, indicating a trend towards fewer infections as the weeks progress. This sustained decrease in influenza cases could suggest either a successful season of controlling influenza transmission or a shift in the population's exposure or susceptibility to the virus, which could lead to potential shifts in healthcare resource allocation and public health strategies.
