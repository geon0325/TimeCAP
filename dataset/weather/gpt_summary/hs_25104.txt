Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before a slight decline towards the evening. Humidity levels showed significant variation, with a stark increase during the early hours, indicative of potential morning fog or dew, and then a steady decrease throughout the day, suggesting drier conditions as temperatures rose. Air pressure has been relatively stable with a slight overall decrease, which could be associated with the arrival of a weather system. Wind speeds remained generally low, with occasional mild gusts, and wind direction experienced shifts from southerly to westerly, and finally to northeasterly, which may influence local weather patterns, possibly bringing in cooler air from different regions. Together, these indicators suggest a typical warm and humid day transitioning to a slightly cooler and drier evening in Houston.
