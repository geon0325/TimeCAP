Over the past 20 weeks, the proportion of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases has shown a persistent upward trend, with the percentage of ILI patients increasing from 1.44% to 2.91%. This rise has crossed the severity benchmark of 2.9% in the most recent week, indicating a potentially escalating influenza situation. The age groups 0-4 and 5-24 have experienced the most significant increases in ILI cases, which could imply a higher transmission rate among young populations and could lead to increased demands on pediatric and family healthcare services. The steady increase in ILI cases among older age groups, particularly those aged 65 and above, is also concerning, as it may result in higher hospitalization and complication rates within these more vulnerable populations. Given these trends, healthcare providers may need to allocate more resources to manage the influx of ILI cases and consider public health interventions to mitigate the spread of influenza.
