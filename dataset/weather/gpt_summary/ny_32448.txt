Over the past 24 hours in New York City, temperatures have experienced a gradual increase, reaching a peak in the later hours before showing signs of a slight decrease, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels have fluctuated considerably, starting at moderate values, decreasing significantly as temperatures peaked, which is characteristic of the inverse relationship between temperature and relative humidity, and then increasing again towards the end of the period. Air pressure, after remaining relatively stable for much of the day, showed a notable increase, suggesting a possible change in weather patterns such as the arrival of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds have been generally low and steady throughout the period, with only minor variations, indicating calm wind conditions. Wind direction has shown a gradual shift from westerly to southwesterly, which could potentially bring warmer air masses into the region.
