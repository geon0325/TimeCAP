Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature with a general cooling trend before warming up again towards the end of the observed period. Humidity levels remained high throughout, peaking at saturation during the cooler early morning hours, which could have led to foggy conditions, particularly near coastal areas. Air pressure was notably high and showed a gradual increasing trend, indicating stable weather conditions and a likelihood of continued fair weather. Wind speeds were consistently calm, suggesting limited dispersion of air pollutants and potentially leading to lower air quality in urban areas. Wind direction varied significantly, with shifts from southerly to northerly and back to southerly directions, which may have influenced localized weather patterns, including coastal fog dispersal and temperature variability.
