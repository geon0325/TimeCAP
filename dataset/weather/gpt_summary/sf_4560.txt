Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature followed by a notable increase, suggesting a typical diurnal variation with cooler temperatures in the early hours and warmer conditions by afternoon. Humidity levels have fluctuated significantly, with particularly high values during the cooler morning hours, decreasing sharply as temperatures rose, which is indicative of the city's coastal climate dynamics. Air pressure has remained relatively stable, with only minor fluctuations that are unlikely to have a significant impact on the weather patterns. Wind speeds have varied, with periods of calm interspersed with gustier conditions, and the prevailing winds have generally shifted from northerly to easterly directions throughout the day. The combination of increasing temperature, variable winds, and fluctuating humidity could result in a mix of weather conditions, including the potential for coastal fog development and variability in cloud cover throughout the day.
