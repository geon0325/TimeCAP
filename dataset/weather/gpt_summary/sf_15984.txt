Over the last 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have shown a gradual increase, indicative of a warming trend that peaked towards the latter part of the observed period. Humidity levels have fluctuated but remained relatively high, suggesting a moist air mass presence over the area, which could lead to a feeling of mugginess or potential fog development, particularly when humidity values reached their peak. Air pressure experienced a noticeable decline, which is typically associated with the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring instability and increased chances of precipitation or changing weather patterns. Wind speeds varied, with periods of calm winds interrupted by a couple of instances of higher wind speeds, possibly affecting local sea conditions and potentially leading to windier conditions on land. The wind direction has been predominantly from the west and northwest, which is common for coastal San Francisco, but there were shifts that included a brief period of winds from the southwest, suggesting variable wind patterns.
