Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have exhibited a slight downward trend overnight before warming up again towards the current hour, staying within a relatively narrow range that suggests stable thermal conditions. Humidity levels have remained very high throughout the period, often reaching saturation, which could indicate persistent fog or mist, particularly during the cooler night and morning hours. Air pressure has been notably high but showed a slight decrease in the most recent hours, which might suggest a gradual change in the weather pattern. Wind speeds have been consistently low, indicating calm conditions with little variation, while wind direction has varied but predominantly came from directions ranging from south to northeast, which could influence localized weather conditions depending on the local geography. Overall, the stable high pressure and high humidity suggest that San Francisco may have experienced foggy conditions, especially during the night and early morning, with calm winds and no significant immediate changes in the weather expected.
