Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, which suggests a cooling trend moving through the area. Humidity levels varied significantly but showed a general increase after a midday low, potentially leading to more muggy conditions as the day progressed. Air pressure readings were relatively stable, with a slight fluctuating trend, indicating steady weather patterns without major disturbances. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate with some increase towards the end of the period, and the wind direction shifted from northerly to southeasterly, which could imply a change in weather systems affecting the region. Overall, the weather in Houston has been stable, but the increase in humidity and changing wind direction may suggest a potential for changing weather conditions in the near future.
