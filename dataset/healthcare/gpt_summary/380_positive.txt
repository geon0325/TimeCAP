Over the last 20 weeks, the data shows a fluctuating but overall declining trend in the ratio of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a peak at 1.31% in the last week compared to a high of 2.94% in the first week. Despite the overall decrease in the positivity rate, the last five weeks have shown a slight increase in the ratio of positive specimens, suggesting a potential resurgence. The number of specimens tested has generally decreased over the period, with a sharp drop from 72,529 in week 12 to 61,439 in week 13, potentially indicating a reduction in surveillance or a seasonal decrease in respiratory illness presentations. The ratio of positive specimens for Influenza A has decreased from 2.79% to 0.59%, while the ratio for Influenza B has increased from 0.15% to 0.72%, suggesting a shift in the prevalent type of influenza. This trend towards a higher relative proportion of Influenza B cases could have implications for clinical treatment and vaccine formulation strategies.
