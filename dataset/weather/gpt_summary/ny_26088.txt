Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the later hours of the period. Despite this warming trend, humidity levels varied significantly, with a notable spike to full saturation followed by a sharp decrease, suggesting the possibility of morning fog or mist that cleared as the day progressed. Air pressure remained relatively stable, indicating a period of steady weather conditions without the presence of major frontal systems. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with some variability in direction, including a shift from northerly to easterly winds. The wind direction changes, combined with the fluctuation in humidity, could have influenced local weather patterns, potentially affecting conditions such as cloud cover and the chance of precipitation.
