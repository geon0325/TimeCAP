Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant increase in the number of respiratory specimens tested for influenza, with a peak of 42,526 tests conducted in the most recent week, up from 6,042 tests in the first week. Despite this increase in testing, the average percentage of positive specimens remains relatively low at 6.26%. However, there has been a gradual increase in the percentage of positive specimens, from 0.15% in the first week to 0.23% in the last week, indicating a potential uptick in influenza activity. Influenza B has shown a more pronounced increase in the ratio of positive specimens compared to Influenza A, with the latest week showing a ratio of 0.15% for Influenza B, which is double the ratio of Influenza A at 0.07%. This trend suggests that healthcare providers should be vigilant for Influenza B, which could have implications for patient management and resource allocation within the healthcare system.
