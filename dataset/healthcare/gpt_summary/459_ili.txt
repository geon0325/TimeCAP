Over the past 20 weeks, the data indicates a rising trend in the proportion of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases, with a peak ratio of 6.90% in week 10, significantly exceeding the benchmark of 2.9%. After this peak, there has been a gradual decline, yet the ratio of ILI patients remains above the threshold, ending at 3.73% in week 20. The age groups contributing most to ILI cases are consistently the 0-4 and 5-24 cohorts, suggesting that children and young adults are the most affected populations. Notably, the highest recorded ILI cases for the 0-4 and 5-24 age groups coincide with the overall peak in week 10, indicating a potential spread within communal settings like schools or daycare centers. This sustained high level of ILI activity above the benchmark could indicate a heavy burden on healthcare resources, emphasizing the need for continued public health vigilance and possible interventions to mitigate the spread of influenza.
