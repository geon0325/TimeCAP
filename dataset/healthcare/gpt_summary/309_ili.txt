Over the past 20 weeks, the ratio of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) patients has remained consistently below the baseline of 2.9%, suggesting that the ILI incidence is lower than the threshold for heightened concern. However, there has been a gradual increase in the ratio of ILI patients in recent weeks, indicating a potential uptick in ILI activity. The most significant increase in ILI cases has been observed in the youngest age group (0-4 years), which could indicate higher vulnerability or transmission rates within this demographic. The data shows a decrease in ILI cases among older age groups, with the lowest numbers reported in those aged 65 and above, which might reflect higher immunity or better preventive measures in this population. Given the current trends, healthcare providers should be vigilant for further increases in ILI rates, particularly among young children, and consider bolstering educational and preventive efforts accordingly.
