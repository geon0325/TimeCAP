Over the last 24 hours, New York City experienced a gradual increase in temperature, transitioning from mild to warmer conditions. Humidity levels saw a significant decrease, indicating drier air moving into the area. Concurrently, air pressure increased substantially, suggesting the development of a high-pressure system which typically brings stable weather conditions. Wind speeds varied but showed periods of increased activity, with a notable shift in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to northerly, which could be associated with the passage of a weather front. The combination of rising temperatures, lowering humidity, increasing pressure, and variable winds points to dynamic weather patterns, possibly leading to clearer skies and more settled weather in the short term.
