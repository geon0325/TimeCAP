Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable decline in the ratio of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a peak ratio of 23.65% in week 6 declining to just 1.83% by week 20. Influenza A has consistently been more prevalent than Influenza B; however, both subtypes have shown a decrease in positive specimen ratios, with Influenza A dropping from a high of 18.16% to 0.71%, and Influenza B from 5.49% to 1.12% in the same period. The total number of specimens tested has also decreased over time, from a high of 36,781 in week 6 to 8,364 in week 20, indicating a potential reduction in infection rates or a decrease in testing. The sharp decline in positive cases, particularly in recent weeks, suggests a waning influenza season, which could lead to a reduction in healthcare system burden from influenza-related illnesses. However, continued surveillance is necessary to monitor for potential resurgences or shifts in the epidemiological trends of influenza.
