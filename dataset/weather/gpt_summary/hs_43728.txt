Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a noticeable fluctuation in temperature with a general upward trend during the day, reaching a peak in the later afternoon before gradually decreasing toward the evening. Humidity levels showed a slight inverse correlation with temperature, being higher during the cooler early hours and decreasing as temperatures peaked, though a significant spike in humidity occurred as temperatures began to fall. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with only minor variations that are not indicative of any significant weather events. Wind speeds were generally light and variable, with a slight increase observed during the peak temperature period, which could contribute to a feeling of lower apparent temperatures. The wind direction was mostly consistent with a northerly component, though there was a brief shift to a northeasterly and northwesterly direction at certain points, suggesting the presence of changing weather fronts or local circulation patterns.
