The time-series analysis of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data over the last 20 weeks reveals a pronounced peak in the ILI ratio above the baseline, indicating a significant period of increased influenza activity, particularly affecting the age groups 0-4 and 25-49. Following this peak, there has been a notable decline in the ILI ratio, suggesting a decrease in influenza cases across all age groups. However, the ILI ratio has not returned to below the baseline, which may indicate a sustained presence of influenza in the population. The highest number of ILI cases in the age group 25-49 during the peak period could have implications for workforce absenteeism and productivity. The healthcare system should remain vigilant and possibly reinforce influenza prevention measures, as the ILI ratio, while decreasing, still indicates ongoing transmission of influenza-like illness.
