Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 experienced mild fluctuations, ending slightly higher, indicative of a cautiously optimistic stock market. Meanwhile, the VIX, a measure of market volatility, showed a slight increase in the latter part of the period, suggesting growing uncertainty or potential investor anxiety. The Nikkei 225 demonstrated a clear upward trend, which may reflect positive investor sentiment towards the Japanese economy or specific sectors within it. Gold Futures faced a declining trend, hitting a low on the last day, which could signal investors moving towards riskier assets or a strengthening US dollar. Crude Oil Futures saw an overall increase, possibly due to supply constraints or geopolitical tensions, which could lead to higher inflationary pressures globally.
