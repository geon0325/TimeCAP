Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a mild decrease in temperature, transitioning from warm conditions earlier in the day to cooler temperatures by the end of the period. Humidity levels were high throughout, frequently reaching saturation, which suggests a significant amount of moisture in the air and a possibility of fog or precipitation. The air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increasing trend, indicating stable weather conditions that could lead to continued cloudiness or clear skies in the absence of other changing weather factors. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with some variability in direction, which may have contributed to the dispersal of any local air pollutants and the mixing of surface air. The wind direction shifted significantly during the period, including a drastic change to come from the northwest, which could have brought cooler air into the region.
