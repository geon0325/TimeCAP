Over the last 20 weeks, the testing data for respiratory specimens has shown a significant increase in the positivity rate for influenza, peaking at a rate of 30.26% before declining to 25.75%. The number of positive specimens for both Influenza A and B has surged, with Influenza A peaking at 19.50% and Influenza B at 17.59%, indicating a substantial presence of both influenza strains in the population. The highest number of specimens tested occurred in week 16, with 72,224 tests, coinciding with the peak in positive cases for Influenza A. The subsequent decline in positive rates for both Influenza A and B suggests a possible tapering off of the influenza season. However, the healthcare system may still be under pressure due to the high levels of influenza activity observed, necessitating continued vigilance and resources for testing, treatment, and possible vaccination efforts.
