Over the last 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable warming trend with the temperature increasing steadily, peaking during the afternoon hours. Humidity levels started moderately high and increased to saturation during the early morning, indicating the possibility of fog or dew, before dropping significantly as temperatures rose, suggesting drier conditions later in the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable, showing subtle fluctuations within the normal range, which implies a stable weather pattern without significant fronts or storms passing through. Wind speeds varied and were generally light to moderate, with the highest gusts occurring in the late afternoon, which could have dispersed any early moisture and contributed to the decrease in humidity. The wind direction was predominantly south to southwesterly, which is typical for bringing in warmer air, consistent with the observed temperature rise.
