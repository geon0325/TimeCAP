Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a slight cooling trend, with the lowest temperatures occurring during the early morning hours. Humidity levels varied significantly, starting off high, dropping markedly, and then spiking again, which could have influenced the perception of temperature and may have resulted in early morning fog or dew. Air pressure saw an overall increasing trend, indicating more stable weather conditions and possibly leading to clearer skies. Wind speeds remained generally low, but there was a brief period of higher wind intensity, which may have contributed to a temporary drop in temperature and changes in local weather conditions. The wind direction was predominantly from the west-northwest, which is typical for the region, but it varied throughout the day, including a period of calm when the winds were negligible.
