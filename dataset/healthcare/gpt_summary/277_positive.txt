Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates that the overall ratio of influenza-positive specimens has been quite low, averaging 6.26%, with a slight increase in the last two weeks. Influenza B has consistently been more prevalent than Influenza A, with its lowest ratio of positive specimens at 0.03% and the highest at 0.14%, compared to Influenza A's range between 0.03% and 0.08%. The total number of specimens tested has generally been decreasing over time, with a notable drop in the 18th week. The ratios of positive specimens for both Influenza A and B experienced a slight uptick in the 16th and 17th weeks, suggesting a potential increase in influenza activity. These trends suggest that while influenza is not widespread, healthcare providers should remain vigilant for potential increases in cases and consider these findings when planning for seasonal influenza prevention and control measures.
