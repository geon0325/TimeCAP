Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a downward trend, decreasing from 4535.43 to 4357.04, indicating a potential shift to risk-off sentiment among investors. This is further evidenced by the increase in the VIX, which rose from 16.41 to 21.10, suggesting heightened market volatility and investor uncertainty. International markets have also experienced fluctuations, with Japan's Nikkei 225 index falling significantly from 29128.11 to 28771.07, while the UK's FTSE 100 has seen less severe declines, closing at 7027.10 from a high of 7138.40. Commodity prices have been mixed; Gold Futures have seen minor fluctuations, ending slightly lower at 1757.00 compared to the starting point of 1830.90, whereas Crude Oil Futures ended higher at 75.88 from an opening of 69.29, which may imply concerns about inflationary pressures or supply constraints. Currency markets show a slight strengthening of the dollar against the Euro and the Japanese Yen, with the EUR/USD pair moving from 1.19 to 1.16 and the USD/JPY moving from 109.94 to 111.46, which could be indicative of a flight to safety as investors seek refuge in the traditionally secure US dollar.
