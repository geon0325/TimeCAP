Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a notable warming trend with the temperature peaking in the late afternoon before gradually declining towards the evening. Humidity levels have fluctuated, generally high during the cooler early hours and then decreasing as temperatures rose, but spiking again with the cooling trend in the evening. Air pressure has been steadily decreasing throughout the period, which could indicate an approaching weather system or front. Wind speeds have been variable but increased significantly during the afternoon, coinciding with the highest temperatures of the day. Wind direction has been predominantly from the west and northwest, with a shift to northerly winds later in the period, which could influence coastal conditions and bring cooler air inland.
