Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has exhibited a typical diurnal pattern with a gradual rise during the day and a decrease at night, maintaining conditions consistent with the expected seasonal averages. Relative humidity levels have fluctuated but remained high, suggesting a persistent level of moisture in the air which could contribute to sensations of mugginess and possibly lead to the formation of fog or dew in the early morning or late evening hours. Air pressure has seen a slight increase indicating stable weather conditions; however, a drop in pressure noticed in recent hours could hint at a potential change in weather patterns, such as an approaching weather system. Wind speeds have been mostly gentle to moderate with some variability, which is not likely to cause significant wind-related impacts. The prevailing winds have been predominantly northerly, with minor variations in direction, which is typical for this region and can contribute to the transport of cooler air into the area.
