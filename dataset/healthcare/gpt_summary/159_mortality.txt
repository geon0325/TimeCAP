Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths. The ratio of mortality from these causes started below the average at 7.46% and saw a sharp increase, peaking at 15.78% in the 12th week, significantly above the 20-week average of 7.84%. Following this peak, there has been a consistent downward trend, with the ratio dropping to 8.34% by the 20th week, suggesting a potential easing of the impact of these illnesses. The absolute number of deaths from Influenza has decreased markedly from 498 to 11 deaths, while Pneumonia-related deaths also declined from a high of 11,988 to 4,895 over the observed period. This trend could indicate a seasonal pattern or the effectiveness of public health interventions, and it highlights the need for ongoing surveillance and resource allocation to manage these respiratory conditions effectively.
