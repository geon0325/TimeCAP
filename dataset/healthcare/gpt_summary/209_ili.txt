Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a clear peak in the percentage of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases, which has subsequently declined to below the baseline level. The age group 5-24 years exhibited the highest number of ILI cases, suggesting a significant impact on school-aged children and young adults. Both the youngest (0-4 years) and oldest (65 years and above) age groups showed the least fluctuation in case numbers, yet maintained a steady presence of ILI cases throughout the period. The mid-age groups (25-49 and 50-64 years) experienced a rise and fall in ILI cases, consistent with the overall trend. The current reduction in ILI ratios below the baseline suggests a potential easing of the healthcare systemâ€™s burden, allowing for reallocation of resources and preparation for future healthcare needs.
