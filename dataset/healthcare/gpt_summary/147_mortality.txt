Over the last 20 weeks, the data shows a progressive increase in the mortality ratio of Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, rising from 5.65% to 7.85%, which is above the average ratio of 7.84%. Notably, there was a significant spike in deaths attributed to influenza during the 10th week, where the number jumped from 141 to 432, which coincided with an increase in the mortality ratio from 6.74% to 7.55%. Despite fluctuations, the number of deaths from pneumonia has generally been on an upward trend, peaking at 4137 in the 11th week. The consistent increase in the mortality ratio suggests a growing impact of Influenza and Pneumonia on overall mortality, potentially indicating a worsening of these respiratory conditions or a higher prevalence in the population. This trend could strain healthcare resources and necessitates close monitoring and possibly increased preventive measures, such as vaccination and public health interventions, to manage the impact on the healthcare system.
