Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable decline in the ratio of mortality due to Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the overall mortality, with a decrease from the initial 5.58% to a low of 4.90% in week 12, before a gradual increase to 5.70% in the final week. Despite fluctuations, this ratio remains below the average of 7.84%, suggesting a relatively lower impact of these respiratory conditions on overall mortality during this period. The absolute number of deaths attributed to Influenza has shown an upward trend in recent weeks, rising from a low of 5 to a peak of 30 deaths. In contrast, deaths from pneumonia have decreased from 2898 in week 1 to 2515 in week 12, followed by a resurgence to 3022 by the end of the 20-week period. These trends could indicate a seasonal pattern or the effectiveness of public health interventions, yet the recent increases warrant continuous surveillance to manage potential healthcare system burdens.
