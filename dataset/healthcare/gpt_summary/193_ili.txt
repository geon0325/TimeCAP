Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable upward trend in the incidence of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) across all age groups, with the percentage of ILI patients surpassing the baseline of 2.9% in recent weeks. This upward trajectory is particularly pronounced in the 5-24 age group, which has seen a substantial increase in ILI cases, suggesting an active spread within this demographic that could potentially affect community transmission rates. The consistent increase in ILI cases among the elderly population, those aged 65 or more, raises concerns due to their higher susceptibility to complications from influenza. The healthcare system may experience increased strain as the ratio of ILI patients has now exceeded the baseline, indicating that ILI activity is at a level that could lead to a higher demand for medical care and resources. Public health officials may need to consider strengthening surveillance and prevention measures, such as vaccination campaigns and public education on hygiene practices, to mitigate the impact of this growing trend.
