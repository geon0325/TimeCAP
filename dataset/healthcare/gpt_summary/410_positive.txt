Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a significant upward trend in the ratio of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the overall average positivity rate increasing from 0.90% to 18.27%. The rise in positive specimens is more pronounced for Influenza A, which saw an increase from 0.52% to 14.99%, compared to Influenza B, which rose from 0.37% to 3.28% in the same period. The highest weekly jump in the positivity rate occurred between weeks 17 and 18, with a leap from 8.49% to 13.46%, suggesting a rapid spread of the virus. Influenza A has consistently shown higher positivity rates than Influenza B throughout the 20 weeks, indicating it may be the dominant strain in the current flu season. This trend indicates a potential surge in healthcare demand for influenza-related medical care and could necessitate increased surveillance, vaccination efforts, and resource allocation to manage the growing number of cases.
