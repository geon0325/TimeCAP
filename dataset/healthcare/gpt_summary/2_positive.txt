Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant increase in the ratio of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, rising from 1.11% in the initial weeks to a peak of 21.11% in the most recent week. The data indicates a worrying trend, with both Influenza A and B contributing to the rise in positive cases; Influenza A showed a marked increase from 0.72% to 16.30%, while Influenza B rose from 0.39% to 4.81%. The week-over-week growth in positive specimens for both strains suggests a rapidly escalating flu season, which has the potential to strain healthcare resources due to increased demand for medical care and diagnostic testing. As the number of specimens tested also increased substantially over the 20-week period, the absolute number of positive cases has grown significantly, not just the ratio, highlighting the importance of continued monitoring and potentially increased public health measures. The high ratios in recent weeks are well above the 20-week average of 6.26%, indicating an urgent need for health authorities to prepare for heightened influenza activity, potentially including vaccination campaigns and public awareness initiatives.
