Over the past 20 market days, the S&P 500 has experienced a notable downward trend, culminating in a significant drop, indicative of increased market uncertainty and potential bearish sentiment. Volatility, as measured by the VIX, has risen sharply, particularly in the last day, reflecting heightened investor anxiety and market turbulence. International indices like the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have similarly shown declines, suggesting a global risk-off mood among investors. Gold futures have increased in value, peaking mid-period before stabilizing, which aligns with gold's status as a safe-haven asset amid market volatility. Crude oil futures have decreased steadily, pointing to potential concerns over global economic growth, while currency exchange rates have seen less dramatic fluctuations, with the EUR/USD and USD/CNY pairings showing slight strengthening of the dollar, and USD/JPY indicating some increased volatility in the last few days.
