Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have displayed a warming trend, peaking during the afternoon hours which is typical for the region. Humidity levels have shown some fluctuations, with higher percentages noted during the early morning and evening, which could have led to a feeling of increased mugginess, especially when temperatures were at their highest. Air pressure experienced significant variability, with a notable increase midday, followed by a sharp decrease, and then rising again towards the end of the 24-hour period, suggesting the passage of a weather front through the area. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a gradual increase as the day progressed, which could have contributed to some relief from the humidity. The prevailing winds were mostly southerly, with some shifts to the southeast and then back, which is consistent with warm air being drawn up from the Gulf of Mexico, affecting the local weather conditions.
