Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual increase in temperature, culminating in a peak during the late afternoon hours before cooling slightly towards the evening. Humidity levels showed significant variation, with notably high humidity in the early morning hours that decreased sharply as the temperature rose, suggesting an inverse relationship between the two. Air pressure remained relatively stable but experienced a noticeable increase in the early evening, which could indicate the potential for changing weather patterns or the arrival of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were consistently light throughout the period, with little fluctuation, and wind direction was predominantly northerly, although there was a brief shift to a southerly direction around midday. This stable wind pattern, combined with the observed atmospheric conditions, suggests a period of calm weather for Houston, though the increase in air pressure might herald cooler and drier conditions ahead.
