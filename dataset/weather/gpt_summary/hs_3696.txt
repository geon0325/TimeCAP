Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before cooling down slightly at night. The humidity levels showed an inverse relationship with temperature, starting relatively low, increasing significantly during the cooler early morning hours, and then decreasing as temperatures rose throughout the day. Air pressure has been steadily decreasing, indicating a potential change in weather patterns or the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds varied, with a noticeable increase during the afternoon, suggesting a breezy condition that coincided with the highest temperatures of the day. The wind direction remained predominantly from the south, shifting slightly towards the south-west later in the day, which can contribute to the warmer temperatures experienced due to the warm air masses from that direction.
