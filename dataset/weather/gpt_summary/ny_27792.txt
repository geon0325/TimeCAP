Over the last 24 hours in New York City, temperatures have seen a slight fluctuation, starting on a cooler note, warming significantly during the day, and then dipping again towards the end of the period. Humidity levels varied considerably, with a noticeable peak during the night hours, which is typical due to the lower temperatures and reduced solar heating, and lower humidity during the day. Air pressure experienced a gradual increase throughout the day, indicating a potential strengthening of a high-pressure system which could lead to more settled weather conditions. Wind speeds were mostly gentle to moderate but showed some variability, with a peak during the afternoon, which could have contributed to a temporary wind chill effect. The wind directions were predominantly westerly with some variations, suggesting that the weather pattern was influenced by an air mass moving in from the west or northwest.
