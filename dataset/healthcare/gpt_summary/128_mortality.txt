Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia as a percentage of total deaths has consistently remained below the 20-week average of 7.84%, indicating a lower impact relative to other causes of death during this period. The mortality ratio shows a slight decreasing trend from 5.67% in the first week to 5.65% in the final week, with minor fluctuations but no significant spikes. Despite a general downward trend in the ratio, the absolute number of deaths from pneumonia has shown an increase in the latter weeks, rising from 2,679 in week 4 to 3,003 in week 20, while Influenza-related deaths also increased from 5 to 25 over the same period. This overall increase in the number of Influenza and Pneumonia deaths, despite a relatively stable total mortality count, may suggest a need for increased healthcare resources focused on respiratory illnesses. The data indicates that while these respiratory diseases are currently accounting for a smaller proportion of total mortality than the average, there is a recent uptick in cases that could have implications for healthcare planning and interventions.
