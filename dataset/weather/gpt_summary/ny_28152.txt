Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a slight decline in temperature, with the trend stabilizing in the later hours. Humidity levels have seen fluctuations, with a notable peak that coincides with a drop in air pressure, possibly indicating a transient weather system passing through the area. Air pressure has generally been rising, suggesting more stable weather conditions might be settling in. Wind speeds have increased towards the end of the period, becoming more gusty, while the wind direction has been predominantly from the west-northwest to west, shifting slightly to the west-southwest at times. This combination of rising air pressure, variable humidity, and increased wind activity could lead to clearer and more stable weather conditions in the short term.
