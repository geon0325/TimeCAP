Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has experienced volatility with an initial increase followed by a sharp decline and subsequent partial recovery, ending slightly lower than its peak. The VIX, which measures market volatility, peaked concurrently with the S&P 500's lowest point, indicating heightened market stress during that period, but has since been on a general downtrend. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have also faced fluctuations, with the Nikkei 225 showing a notable dip mid-period before partially rebounding, while the FTSE 100 has demonstrated a gradual recovery after a significant drop. Gold futures have trended upwards, reflecting investors' increased risk aversion and a potential hedge against market uncertainty. The exchange rates have remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting that currency markets have not experienced as much volatility as equity and commodities markets during the observed period.
