Over the last 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, transitioning from warm to more moderate conditions. Humidity levels have shown significant variation, peaking at night, which could have contributed to instances of dense fog or mist, particularly when the humidity reached saturation. Air pressure remained relatively stable for most of the period but showed a sharp decrease at one point, indicating the potential for a change in weather patterns, such as the onset of a weather front. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with a noticeable increase towards the end of the period, suggesting the possibility of more turbulent conditions following the pressure drop. The wind direction varied, with predominantly southerly winds shifting to include more easterly components, possibly influencing the temperature and humidity levels experienced.
