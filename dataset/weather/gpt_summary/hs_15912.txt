Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have shown a warming trend, peaking during the late afternoon before gradually cooling down in the evening. Humidity levels have exhibited a general decline throughout the day, with a notable dip during the hottest part of the day, suggesting possible discomfort due to combined heat and moisture earlier in the period. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight fluctuation, ending the period with a significant increase, which could signal a change in weather patterns, such as the arrival of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds varied modestly, with calm winds in the early morning hours, increasing slightly during the day, and stronger gusts in the early evening, potentially influencing the perceived temperature and dispersion of humidity. The wind direction was predominantly from the south to the southwest, shifting briefly to a northerly and variable direction, before settling back to a southerly flow, which is typical for this region and could contribute to the transport of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico.
