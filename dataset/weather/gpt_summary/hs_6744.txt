Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature throughout the day, peaking in the late afternoon before a slight decrease towards the evening. Humidity levels were variable but showed a marked increase during the night, which could have contributed to a sensation of mugginess, especially when temperatures were at their highest. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with only minor fluctuations that are not indicative of significant weather changes. Wind speeds were mostly light and variable, with a tendency to be calmer during the night and early morning. Wind direction shifted throughout the day, with a notable change from predominantly southeasterly to northerly and then returning to southeasterly, suggesting that localized weather patterns could be influencing the wind behavior in Houston.
