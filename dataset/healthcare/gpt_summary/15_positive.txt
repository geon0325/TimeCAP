Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the ratio of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a peak of 23.65% in week 8, followed by a gradual decline to 3.06% by week 20. Influenza A has consistently been the predominant strain, reaching a high of 18.16% positive specimens in week 8, but its incidence has decreased more sharply than Influenza B, falling to 0.81% by week 20. In contrast, Influenza B showed a slower decline and maintained a higher proportion of positives relative to Influenza A in later weeks, with a slight increase in ratio from week 11 to week 13, suggesting a potential shift in the dominant strain. The overall decline in positive specimen ratios indicates a current waning phase of the influenza season, which may lead to a temporary reduction in healthcare burden related to flu cases. However, the healthcare system should remain vigilant for possible fluctuations or a resurgence in cases, and continue promoting vaccination and preventive measures, especially for vulnerable populations.
