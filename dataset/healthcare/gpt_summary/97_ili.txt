Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in the number of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases across different age groups, with a significant increase in the ratio of ILI patients exceeding the baseline in several weeks. The data indicates that the highest burden of ILI is concentrated among the younger population, specifically in the age groups of 0-4 and 5-24, which saw substantial rises in ILI cases, peaking in the mid-range of the timeframe. Notably, for a continuous stretch, the ILI ratio remained above the baseline of 2.9%, pointing toward a heightened period of ILI activity that could potentially strain healthcare resources. Although the ratio of ILI cases has shown some decline towards the end of the observed period, it remains close to the threshold, suggesting that ILI is still prevalent in the community. Healthcare providers should remain vigilant and possibly strengthen their response in pediatrics and general practice, as the data suggests sustained transmission and the risk of impact on vulnerable populations, particularly the very young and the elderly.
