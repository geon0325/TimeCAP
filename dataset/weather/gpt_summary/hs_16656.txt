Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a subtle fluctuation in temperatures with a general downward trend during the nighttime and a subsequent increase during the daytime, indicating typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels remained high throughout the period, which is characteristic of Houston's generally moist climate, potentially contributing to a muggy and uncomfortable atmosphere for residents. Air pressure has been relatively stable, showing only minor variations, suggesting a period of steady weather without significant frontal activity. Wind speeds have been mostly light to moderate but increased towards the end of the period, which could contribute to a slight cooling effect, especially when coupled with the higher night-time humidity levels. The wind direction shifted from easterly to northeasterly, which may bring a change in air mass, potentially affecting local weather conditions slightly.
