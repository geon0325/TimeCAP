Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable decline in the proportion of deaths attributed to influenza or pneumonia when compared to total mortality, with the initial ratio of 8.44% dropping to 5.44%. The total number of deaths fluctuated but showed a slight downward trend overall, while the absolute numbers for deaths specifically from influenza saw a significant decrease from 738 to 5. Deaths from pneumonia also decreased, but at a more gradual pace, from 4044 to 2781. Despite this decline, the ratio of 5.44% in the most recent week still falls below the 20-week average of 7.84%, indicating a shift in the mortality landscape. This downward trend could indicate an improvement in public health measures, a seasonal pattern, or increased immunity within the population, but continued monitoring is essential to understand the long-term implications for healthcare resources and disease management strategies.
