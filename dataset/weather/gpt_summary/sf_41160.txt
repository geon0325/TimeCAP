Over the last 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature, with a general trend of cooling overnight followed by warming during the day. Humidity levels have varied significantly, peaking at near saturation during the early hours and exhibiting much drier conditions towards the end of the period. Air pressure has shown some variability, with a notable decrease mid-period, which can be indicative of changing weather systems moving through the area. Wind speeds have been mostly light to moderate, with occasional gusts, and the wind direction has been variable with no dominant direction sustained over the period. These conditions, with the combination of variable humidity and pressure changes, suggest a dynamic weather pattern that could lead to unpredictable weather conditions, including the potential for fog formation or sudden changes in temperature.
