Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have shown a mild fluctuation, with a general cooling trend during the night that reversed towards the afternoon. Humidity levels were notably high and reached saturation at several points, which could have led to foggy conditions, especially when coupled with the stable high air pressure system in place. Air pressure remained consistently high throughout the period, suggesting stable weather conditions. Wind speeds were light and showed very little variation, which, when combined with high humidity and stable air pressure, could result in persistent weather patterns. The wind direction was predominantly from the west-southwest, which is typical for coastal San Francisco and could influence coastal fog and temperature moderation.
