Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, followed by a slight increase, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels have shown fluctuations, with a noticeable increase towards the latter part of the time period, which could contribute to a feeling of increased mugginess or potential for fog development, especially given San Francisco's coastal location. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight increase in the middle of the period before dropping back down, suggesting stable weather conditions but a possible change on the horizon. Wind speeds varied, with some hours experiencing stronger gusts, which can affect coastal conditions and temperature perceptions. Wind direction shifted throughout the day, predominantly coming from the west and northwest, which is common for the region and can bring cooler ocean air inland.
