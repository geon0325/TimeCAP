Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia as a percentage of total deaths has exhibited a generally declining trend, starting at 8.75% and ending at 5.79%, indicating a decrease in the proportion of deaths attributed to these illnesses relative to overall mortality. The total number of deaths peaked in the second week at 70,168 before falling to a low of 24,395 in the nineteenth week, suggesting a possible seasonal fluctuation or a response to public health interventions. The absolute number of deaths from both Influenza and Pneumonia also showed a declining trend, with deaths from Influenza dropping from a high of 993 to 28, and from Pneumonia decreasing from 5,428 to 3,330 over the 20-week period. The lowest ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia was recorded in the nineteenth week at 5.70%, which is significantly below the average ratio of 7.84%, potentially indicating an effective response to these illnesses or other contributing factors such as vaccine uptake. These trends could suggest improvements in public health measures, healthcare delivery, or population health regarding these respiratory diseases, but further analysis is necessary to understand the underlying causes and to ensure that the healthcare system remains prepared for possible future increases in these types of mortality.
