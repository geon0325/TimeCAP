Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, followed by a notable increase towards the latter part of the period, indicating a typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels were strikingly high and consistent, reaching saturation for several hours, suggesting the likelihood of fog or low clouds during that time, which is common for coastal cities like San Francisco. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable for most of the period but showed a significant drop towards the end, which could be indicative of an approaching weather system that may lead to changing weather conditions, such as increased chances of precipitation or storms. Wind speeds varied moderately, with a peak in the earlier hours that gradually lessened, though there was a slight increase in wind activity towards the end, which is often associated with incoming weather fronts. The prevailing winds came predominantly from the west and shifted slightly throughout the day, with an unusual shift towards a northerly direction at the end, possibly as a response to the changing pressure systems impacting the region.
