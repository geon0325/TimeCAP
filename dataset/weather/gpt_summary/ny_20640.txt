Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced consistently high humidity levels, reaching saturation at several points, which may have led to foggy conditions and potentially contributed to a damp, heavy air feeling throughout the city. Temperatures have remained relatively stable with a slight fluctuation, suggesting a steady weather pattern without significant warm or cold fronts moving through the area. The air pressure showed minor variations but increased towards the end of the period, possibly indicating the approach of a high-pressure system that could lead to clearer skies and calmer weather. Wind speeds were generally light to gentle, which would not have contributed significantly to wind chill or the dispersal of any precipitation. The predominant wind direction was from the northeast, with some variability, which is typical for coastal cities like New York and might have influenced the transportation of maritime air masses into the region.
