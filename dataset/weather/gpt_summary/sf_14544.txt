Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures exhibited a typical diurnal cycle with a noticeable increase during the daylight hours followed by a gradual decrease after sunset. Humidity levels fluctuated, with the highest levels occurring during the early morning hours and a significant drop towards the late afternoon, suggesting a possible passage of a dry air mass or the influence of localized factors such as sea breezes. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout most of the day, but there was a marked drop in the last few hours, which could indicate the approach of a weather system that may affect local conditions imminently. Wind speeds varied moderately with a period of calm winds around midday, and wind direction shifted significantly in the latter part of the period, starting predominantly from a westerly direction and moving towards a northerly direction by the end of the 24-hour period, signaling a change in the prevailing weather pattern. These indicators suggest that San Francisco's weather is currently undergoing a transition, potentially leading to changing weather conditions in the near future.
