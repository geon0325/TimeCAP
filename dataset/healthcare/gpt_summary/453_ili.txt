Over the past 20 weeks, the data indicates a notable increase in the percentage of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases, with the ratio of ILI patients climbing from 1.99% to a peak of 6.90% in week 16 before slightly declining to 4.22% by week 20. The benchmark of 2.9% ILI cases was consistently exceeded from week 8 onward, suggesting a significant and sustained influenza season. All age groups saw an increase in ILI cases, with the most substantial rise among patients aged 5-24 and 25-49, which may imply higher transmission rates within these age cohorts. The peak in ILI cases coincides with weeks 14 to 16, where the proportion of ILI cases was substantially above the benchmark, indicating a critical period that would have likely increased demand for healthcare resources. The recent decrease in ILI cases suggests a potential tapering off of the season; however, rates still remain above the benchmark, indicating that the healthcare system should remain vigilant and prepared for continued influenza activity.
