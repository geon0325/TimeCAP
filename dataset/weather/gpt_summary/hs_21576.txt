Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a slight fluctuation in temperature, with a general trend of cooling during the early hours and a warming trend during the day, which is typical for the area. Humidity levels have remained relatively high throughout the period, indicating a persistently moist atmosphere that could lead to discomfort for residents and the possible development of fog or precipitation. Air pressure has been stable and relatively high, suggesting steady weather conditions without the immediate likelihood of significant weather disturbances such as storms. Wind speeds have been consistently light, which could lead to the accumulation of pollutants in the air due to the lack of dispersion, affecting air quality. The wind direction varied but predominantly came from the south to southeast, a pattern that often brings warmer air and moisture from the Gulf of Mexico into the region.
