Over the last 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have exhibited a typical diurnal pattern with a gradual decrease overnight reaching the lowest point around dawn, followed by a steady increase throughout the day. Humidity levels have been high, peaking during the early morning hours when temperatures were at their lowest, indicative of possible fog or mist formations which are common in the region. Air pressure experienced some fluctuation, with a notable increase mid-period, suggesting the transient influence of a high-pressure system, which could have led to clearer skies temporarily. Wind speed remained generally low throughout the period, with a brief increase, which may have contributed to a dispersion of humidity and a temporary clearing of skies. Wind direction varied but showed a tendency for westerly and northwesterly winds, typical for coastal San Francisco, which could influence the marine layer and the movement of coastal fog.
