Over the last 24 hours in New York City, the temperature exhibited a gradual warming trend, reaching its peak in the later hours. The relative humidity started high but showed a notable decrease as the day progressed, suggesting drier conditions moving in. Atmospheric pressure experienced a significant drop early in the period, followed by stabilization at a lower level, which could be indicative of a passing weather system. Wind speeds were variable but mostly moderate, with a couple of spikes, and the wind direction shifted frequently, showing signs of changing weather patterns. The combination of dropping humidity, lower pressure, and variable winds could suggest the passage of a frontal system, potentially leading to clearer skies but also cooler temperatures following the system's departure.
