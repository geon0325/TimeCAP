Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable decline in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for both Influenza A and B, with the overall ratio of positive specimens decreasing from 4.86% to 1.70%. The number of specimens tested each week decreased initially but has been on an upward trend in the latter weeks, suggesting a potential increase in surveillance or testing efforts. Despite the overall decline in positivity rates, the proportion of positive specimens for Influenza A has shown a slight increase in recent weeks, from 0.98% to 1.14%, which may indicate a resurgence or seasonal variation of this strain. In contrast, Influenza B has remained at a relatively stable and lower positivity rate, with a minor increase from 0.45% to 0.57% in the latter weeks. These trends suggest that while the overall prevalence of influenza is decreasing, healthcare systems should remain vigilant for changes in infection patterns, particularly for Influenza A.
