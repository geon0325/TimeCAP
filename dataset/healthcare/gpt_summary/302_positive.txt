Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant increase in the ratio of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the percentage rising from 0.06% in the first week to 2.89% in the last week. The number of specimens tested each week has also increased, suggesting a higher demand for testing, possibly due to an upsurge in respiratory illness. Notably, Influenza A has shown a more pronounced increase in positivity rate compared to Influenza B, with its ratio escalating from 0.02% to 2.81%, which indicates that Influenza A is the predominant strain in the current influenza cases. Despite both strains showing growth, the consistent but slower rise in Influenza B, from 0.05% to 0.08%, implies that Influenza A is driving the overall increase in positive specimens. This trend of rising influenza cases could place additional strain on healthcare resources, necessitating preparedness in terms of vaccines, antivirals, and hospital capacity to manage potential patient influx.
