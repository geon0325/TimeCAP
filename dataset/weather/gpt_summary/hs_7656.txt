Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a notable fluctuation in temperature, with a general trend of warming during the day followed by a significant drop in the late evening. Relative humidity experienced peaks coinciding with the cooler temperatures, reaching saturation during the nighttime and early morning hours, suggesting the possibility of fog or dew. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively steady but showed a slight downward trend, which could indicate an approaching weather system or front. Wind speeds were mostly light and variable, with occasional shifts in direction that did not suggest the presence of any strong weather systems. The wind direction varied broadly from northeasterly to southerly, then shifted to a more northerly direction, a pattern that aligns with typical diurnal variations and passing localized systems.
