The analysis of the provided Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data over the last 20 weeks indicates a declining trend in the overall number of patients presenting to healthcare facilities. Despite a decrease in patient volume, ILI percentages have consistently remained below the baseline of 2.9%, suggesting a mild ILI season thus far. The age distribution of ILI cases shows that the highest incidence has been among the 5-24 age group, while the lowest incidence is observed in the 65 or older age group. Towards the end of the 20-week period, there is a slight uptick in ILI percentages across all age groups, which warrants monitoring for any potential increase in ILI activity. Healthcare systems should remain vigilant and prepared for fluctuations in ILI cases, although the current situation appears to be under control.
