Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a significant increase in both the number and the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the total positivity ratio rising from 2.05% to 22.53%. The number of specimens tested weekly has also steadily increased, peaking at 54,480 in the most recent week. Influenza B has shown a more pronounced surge than Influenza A, with the latest ratios being 15.75% and 6.79% respectively, indicating a higher prevalence and potential impact on the population. This upward trend in influenza cases could strain healthcare resources and necessitates increased vigilance and possibly greater allocation of medical supplies and personnel to manage the rising caseload. The data suggests the importance of public health measures, such as vaccination and awareness campaigns, to mitigate the spread of influenza as we observe a significant uptick in cases.
