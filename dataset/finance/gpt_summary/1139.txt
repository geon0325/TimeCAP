Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 showed a downward trend, declining from 4510.04 to 4467.71, indicating potential investor cautiousness or a shift to a bearish market sentiment. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, remained relatively stable but showed a slight increase towards the end of the period, suggesting growing uncertainty among investors. Gold Futures and Crude Oil Futures moved in opposite directions, with Gold declining from 1959.20 to 1915.40, reflecting a decrease in safe-haven demand, while Crude Oil increased from 76.89 to 84.40, possibly due to geopolitical tensions or supply concerns. The FTSE 100 and the Nikkei 225 both exhibited some volatility but ended the period slightly higher, indicating resilience in European and Asian markets. Currency markets saw the USD strengthening against the JPY and CNY, while the EUR/USD exchange rate remained largely unchanged, which could imply a stronger American economy or a flight to the dollar's safety amid market uncertainties.
