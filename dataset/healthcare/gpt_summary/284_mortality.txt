Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality rate from influenza and pneumonia as a percentage of total deaths has exhibited a significant increase, with the most recent data showing a nearly twofold rise from the 20-week average of 7.84% to a peak of 14.15%. This surge is primarily driven by deaths attributed to pneumonia, which soared to 9741 in one week compared to an average of approximately 3650 in previous weeks. The number of deaths from influenza remained relatively low and stable, with minor fluctuations and no clear upward or downward trend. The overall number of deaths also experienced a notable spike in the later weeks, reaching a high of 68969 from an average of around 58400. This trend suggests a potential strain on healthcare resources due to an increased burden of pneumonia, underscoring the need for enhanced prevention and treatment strategies for respiratory illnesses.
