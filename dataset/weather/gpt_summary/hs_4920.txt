Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, transitioning from warmer conditions to cooler temperatures by the end of the observed period. Simultaneously, humidity levels peaked in the early hours but later showed a significant decrease, suggesting drier air moving into the area. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, which is often indicative of stable weather conditions and the potential onset of clearer skies. Wind patterns were quite variable, with both speed and direction fluctuating, including periods of calm and gustier winds, along with a noticeable shift from southerly to northerly wind directions. The combination of decreasing humidity, rising air pressure, and variable winds indicates that Houston might be experiencing the passage of a frontal system, leading to cooler and possibly clearer weather conditions following the change.
