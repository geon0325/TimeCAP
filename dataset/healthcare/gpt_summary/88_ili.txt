Over the past 20 weeks, the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data has shown a fluctuating but generally increasing trend in the percentage of ILI patients across all age groups. Initially, the ILI rates remained well below the baseline threshold, however, in recent weeks, the ILI percentage has surpassed the baseline, indicating a notable rise in ILI cases that could signal an uptick in influenza activity. The most significant increases in ILI rates have been observed in the younger age groups, particularly those aged 5-24, which may reflect higher transmission rates in settings such as schools or colleges. This upward trend has implications for healthcare resource allocation, as it may lead to increased demand for medical attention, diagnostic testing, and potential hospital admissions. Public health authorities may need to consider reinforcing preventive measures, such as flu vaccinations and public awareness campaigns, to mitigate the impact on the healthcare system.
