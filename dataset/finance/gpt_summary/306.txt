Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 exhibited a volatile yet overall upward trend, increasing from 2304.92 to 2874.56, suggesting a recovering confidence among investors despite ongoing concerns. The VIX, or Volatility Index, decreased from 66.04 to 38.15, indicating that market volatility has reduced, which typically corresponds with an increase in market stability. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 also showed recovery, with the Nikkei rising from 16552.83 to 19897.26 and the FTSE 100 from 5190.80 to 5787.00, reflecting a global trend of market improvements. Gold futures initially rose as investors sought safe-haven assets, peaking at 1756.70, but subsequently fell to 1689.20, which may suggest a shift in investor sentiment towards riskier assets as markets stabilize. Crude oil futures continued a downward trend, from 22.43 to 18.27, highlighting persistent concerns over global demand and storage amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, while currency markets showed minor fluctuations in the EUR/USD, USD/JPY, and USD/CNY exchange rates, remaining relatively stable.
