Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual decline in temperature from its peak during the daytime to a cooler state by the night, consistent with normal diurnal patterns. Humidity levels were high throughout the period, peaking during the early morning hours, which could have contributed to instances of morning fog or dew. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable with a slight decrease over the day, suggesting no significant weather disturbances in the immediate future. Wind speeds varied modestly, with calmer conditions prevailing during the night and early morning, and slightly stronger breezes felt during the day. The wind direction was predominantly from the south to southeast, which is typical for Houston's climate and could be responsible for bringing in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, maintaining the humidity levels observed.
