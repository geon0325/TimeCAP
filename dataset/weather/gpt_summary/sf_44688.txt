The temperature remained consistently high, indicative of a heatwave or unusual heat event for the area. Humidity levels stayed low throughout, suggesting an arid environment that may increase the risk of wildfires, particularly in surrounding areas prone to such events. Atmospheric pressure was constant, pointing to a stable weather pattern without immediate signs of significant change.
