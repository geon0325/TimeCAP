Over the past 24 hours, the weather in Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before starting to cool down. Humidity levels showed fluctuations, starting relatively high, decreasing towards the afternoon, and then increasing again in the evening, which is typical of Houston's coastal climate and could contribute to the feeling of mugginess. Air pressure saw a slight overall decline throughout the period, which could indicate the approach of a weather system that may lead to unsettled conditions. Wind speeds varied, with a slight increase towards the end of the day, which could help dispel any humidity-related discomfort. The wind direction was predominantly southerly, shifting slightly to the south-southeast and then to the south-southwest, suggesting the influence of sea breezes on the local weather patterns.
