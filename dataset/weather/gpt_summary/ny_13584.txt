Over the last 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, indicating a warming trend. The relative humidity has varied, with noticeable dips during the warmest parts of the day, which is typical as warmer air can hold more moisture before it reaches saturation. Air pressure has been steadily decreasing, which could be indicative of an approaching weather system that may bring changes such as increased cloudiness or precipitation. Wind speeds have been generally light but showed some increase towards the end of the period, with the wind direction shifting from variable to predominantly coming from the south and southeast. The combination of decreasing pressure, increasing temperature, and shifting wind patterns suggest that New Yorkers could experience a change in weather conditions, potentially leading to unsettled weather in the near future.
