Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual increase in temperature after a cooler start, with the warmest conditions observed in the late afternoon before a slight cooling trend commenced. Humidity levels initially fluctuated but significantly increased during the night, likely due to falling temperatures, and then decreased towards the afternoon, which is typical as the air warms and can hold more moisture. Air pressure showed a general decreasing trend throughout the period, which could indicate a change in weather patterns, possibly leading to an increased chance of precipitation or unsettled weather in the near future. Wind speeds were mostly light and variable, with a brief increase, which is not likely to have had a significant impact on the weather. Wind direction was predominantly from the north to northeast, with a notable shift to the west-southwest in the evening, which could be associated with the passage of a weather front or a change in the local pressure system.
