Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a fluctuating but generally increasing trend in the number of patients reporting Influenza-like Illness (ILI) across all age groups, with the highest volume of cases among individuals aged 25-49. Despite this increase, the ratio of ILI patients to total patients has remained below the baseline of 2.9%, suggesting that while ILI cases are rising, they have not yet reached a level considered to be of heightened concern. The age groups 0-4 and 65 or more have consistently reported the fewest cases, whereas school-aged children and young adults (aged 5-24) have seen a more pronounced peak, which could be attributable to higher rates of social interaction and transmission in these demographics. The data also reveals a peak in ILI percentages across all age groups mid-way through the timeframe, followed by a gradual decline towards the end of the period under review. Healthcare providers and public health officials should monitor these trends closely to allocate resources effectively and potentially prepare for an increase in healthcare demand if the ILI ratio approaches or exceeds the baseline threshold.
