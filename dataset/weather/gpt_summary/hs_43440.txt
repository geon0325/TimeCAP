Over the last 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have experienced a gradual increase, reaching their peak during the late afternoon hours, consistent with a typical diurnal pattern. Humidity levels have shown significant variation, with notably high humidity in the early morning, which decreased as temperatures peaked, suggesting a possible discomfort level due to the combination of heat and moisture during certain periods. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increasing trend towards the middle of the day, indicating steady weather conditions without the immediate approach of a significant weather system. Wind speeds were generally light with occasional moderate gusts, while wind direction varied predominantly from southerly to southeasterly, which could have contributed to the transport of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico into the area. The combination of these factors points to a warm and somewhat muggy day for Houston, with no immediate signs of severe weather disruptions.
