Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a general decline in the total number of deaths, with a peak at 57,045 in the second week and a low of 49,362 in the final week. Deaths from influenza have significantly decreased from 376 to 3, suggesting a substantial reduction in influenza-related mortality. In contrast, deaths from pneumonia have shown less variability, with a slight decrease from 4,100 to 2,853, indicating a persistent burden of pneumonia-related deaths on the healthcare system. The ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia to the total number of deaths started at 7.90% and ended at 5.79%, showing an overall downward trend, but with fluctuations that include a few weeks where the ratio increased. This trend indicates a relative decrease in the proportion of deaths due to Influenza or Pneumonia compared to total deaths, which could suggest an improvement in the management or prevention of these conditions, seasonal variation, or shifts in the prevalence of other causes of death.
