Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality rate from influenza or pneumonia as a percentage of total deaths has shown a general declining trend, starting at 13.74% and ending at 5.89%, with the average weekly mortality rate of 7.84%. The highest number of deaths attributed to influenza occurred in the second week with 887 deaths, which is an anomaly compared to the range of 34-152 deaths in other weeks. Pneumonia deaths started at 10,052, gradually decreasing to 3,365 by the end of the period, reflecting a significant drop in pneumonia-related mortality. This overall decrease in the mortality rate from influenza and pneumonia is a positive indicator, but the healthcare system must remain vigilant as such trends can be subject to seasonal variations and potential new outbreaks. The initial high values followed by a decrease suggest that there may have been a peak in cases or an improved response to treatment and prevention in the subsequent weeks.
