Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching a peak during the late afternoon hours before tapering off slightly towards the evening. Relative humidity levels were inversely correlated with temperature changes, showing higher humidity during the cooler early morning hours and lower humidity as temperatures rose, indicative of typical diurnal patterns. Air pressure remained relatively stable with only minor fluctuations, suggesting a steady atmospheric condition without the immediate influence of strong weather systems. Wind speeds were moderate and increased towards the middle of the day, which could have contributed to the dispersion of humidity and a more comfortable feel in the air despite the warmth. The prevailing wind direction was predominantly from the south to southeast, which is typical for Houston and can bring in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, potentially affecting local weather conditions with increased cloudiness or precipitation chances.
