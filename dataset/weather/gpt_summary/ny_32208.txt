Over the past 24 hours in New York City, the temperature has experienced minor fluctuations, with a general cooling trend indicating a slight decline in warmth. Humidity levels have shown significant variability, with peaks suggesting the potential for a damp atmosphere at times, which may have affected the perceived temperature. Air pressure has been on a downward trend, which could be indicative of an approaching weather system that may bring changes such as increased cloudiness or precipitation.
