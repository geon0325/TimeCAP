Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a modest fluctuation in temperature, showing a general cooling trend overnight with a subsequent warming trend during the day. Humidity levels have remained relatively high throughout the period, peaking around the same time temperatures reached their lowest points, which suggests a possible influence on the perceived chilliness during the night and early morning. Air pressure has been quite stable, with a slight increase which could indicate stable weather conditions in the near term. Wind speeds have varied, decreasing significantly during the night and picking up again towards the end of the 24-hour period, and the predominant wind direction has been westerly, which is typical for the San Francisco area due to its coastal geography. The combination of these factors implies a generally stable weather pattern with no immediate indications of severe weather events.
