Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant rise in the ratio of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, exceeding the average positive specimen ratio of 6.26% and reaching a peak of 26.27% in week 18. The prevalence of Influenza A is notably higher compared to Influenza B, with Influenza A ratios surging from 0.43% to 26.15%, indicating a dominant strain impacting the population. Notably, the increase in positive specimens correlates with a rise in the number of specimens tested, suggesting heightened surveillance and possibly increased transmission. The recent downward trend in both the number of positive specimens and their ratios in the last two weeks may signal a potential decline in influenza activity, but the ratios still remain significantly above the average. This data underscores the importance of continued monitoring and resource allocation within the healthcare system to manage the elevated levels of influenza cases.
