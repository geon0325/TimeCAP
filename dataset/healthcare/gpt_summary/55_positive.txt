Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable increase in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the ratio of positive specimens rising from 1.51% in week 1 to 19.27% in week 20, peaking at 24.73% in week 18. The data indicates that Influenza A has been the predominant subtype, with its highest positivity rate reaching 20.21% in week 16, whereas Influenza B showed a significant late-season surge, peaking at 7.24% in week 20. The overall average positivity rate of 6.26% was exceeded from week 7 onwards, suggesting an intensifying flu season. This trend points towards an increased burden on healthcare resources, potentially necessitating the mobilization of additional medical supplies, staff, and patient care facilities. Public health agencies may need to intensify flu vaccination campaigns and community awareness to mitigate the spread and impact of the disease.
