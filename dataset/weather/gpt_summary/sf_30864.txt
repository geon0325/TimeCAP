Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures remained relatively stable with a slight fluctuation, indicative of typical coastal climate conditions. Humidity levels experienced significant variability, reaching a peak of saturation at one point, which may have led to fog formation, particularly common in this region. Air pressure showed an increasing trend for a period followed by a gradual decrease, suggesting the passage of a weather system through the area. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with occasional higher gusts, and wind directions shifted between predominantly westerly and southerly vectors, which could influence the movement of marine air masses inland. These combined meteorological factors point towards a dynamic weather pattern with potential for changes in cloud cover and temperature in the short-term forecast.
