Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual increase in temperature, culminating in a peak before a slight decline, consistent with the diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, starting moderate, then increasing during the cooler early morning hours, and finally dropping in the hotter afternoon hours before rising again. Air pressure steadily decreased throughout the period, suggesting a potential weather system moving into the area which could lead to changes in weather patterns. Wind speeds were mostly moderate but showed some variability with occasional increases that could contribute to a cooling effect amidst rising temperatures. The wind direction was predominantly from the south with slight variations, which is typical for this region and can bring in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, possibly affecting local humidity and precipitation patterns.
