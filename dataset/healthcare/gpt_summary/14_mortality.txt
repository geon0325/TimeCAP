Over the last 20 weeks, the proportion of deaths attributable to influenza or pneumonia compared to total mortality has shown a slight declining trend, decreasing from 7.26% to 5.58%. Despite weekly fluctuations, the total number of deaths has decreased from 54,861 to 49,517, and the absolute numbers of deaths due to influenza have also declined significantly, from 208 to 7. Pneumonia-related deaths have seen a modest reduction from 3,776 to 2,756. The reduction in both the ratio and absolute numbers could suggest an improvement in the control and treatment of these respiratory conditions or seasonal variations impacting their prevalence. However, since the ratio of mortality from influenza or pneumonia remains above 5%, these illnesses continue to contribute notably to overall mortality, emphasizing the need for ongoing vigilance and healthcare resource allocation.
