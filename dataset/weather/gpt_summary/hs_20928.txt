Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has exhibited a gradual increase, indicating a warming trend that could lead to warmer conditions going forward. Humidity levels have shown a slight decrease, suggesting a reduction in the moisture content in the air, which may be associated with a lessening of the muggy conditions typically experienced in the area. Air pressure has remained relatively stable, with a slight increase observed, which is indicative of steady weather patterns and possibly clearer skies. Wind speeds have seen a modest decrease, potentially leading to calmer conditions, although the consistency of the wind direction from the south suggests a steady flow of air that could be influencing the local climate. The persistent southerly winds could also be contributing to the gradual increase in temperature, as they usually bring warmer air from the tropics to the region.
