The analysis of the provided Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data over the last 20 weeks indicates a declining trend in the percentage of ILI patients across all age groups. The ratio of ILI patients started significantly above the baseline threshold but has progressively decreased to well below the baseline in the most recent weeks. This decrease suggests a reduction in the spread or severity of ILI within the population. The largest decrease in ILI patients occurred in the younger age groups, which could potentially be attributed to the end of the traditional flu season or effective public health interventions. As the ratio of ILI patients has fallen below the baseline, this may reduce the strain on healthcare resources, but continuous monitoring is necessary to promptly address any potential resurgence.
