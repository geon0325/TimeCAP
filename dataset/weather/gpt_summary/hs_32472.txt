Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a notable fluctuation in temperature, which experienced a gradual increase throughout the day, peaking in the late afternoon before starting to decrease slightly into the night. The humidity levels showed a reverse trend with relatively high values in the early hours that decreased as temperatures rose, indicating a typical diurnal pattern that could have led to muggy conditions in the morning, becoming more comfortable as the day progressed. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor variations, suggesting steady weather conditions, though a slight decrease toward the end of the period could signal an approaching change in weather patterns. Wind speeds were consistent and light throughout the period, which, combined with the high humidity, might have contributed to a feeling of stillness and a potential for the development of fog or mist. The wind direction was predominantly from the south-southwest, which is typical for Houston and can often bring in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, affecting local humidity and temperature conditions.
