Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a moderate fluctuation in temperature with the warmest conditions occurring in the late afternoon and cooler temperatures in the early morning hours. Relative humidity levels have remained high throughout the period, signifying a potential for a muggy atmosphere, especially during the times when temperatures were at their peak. Air pressure showed a slight increasing trend during the day, which typically suggests stable weather conditions, but this rise was not significant enough to indicate a strong high-pressure system moving into the area. Wind speeds were mostly calm to light throughout the period, but there was an increase towards the evening, indicating that breezier conditions were developing. The wind direction varied, with a shift towards northerly winds later in the day, which could bring cooler air from the ocean, affecting the local climate.
