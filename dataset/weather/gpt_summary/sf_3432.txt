Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have experienced a gradual decrease overnight before warming up again during the day, with the typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels started moderately and increased towards the morning, indicating the presence of moisture in the air, but decreased as the day progressed, suggesting drier conditions by the evening. Atmospheric pressure showed a slight but steady increase throughout the period, which is generally associated with stable weather conditions and could indicate the approach of high-pressure systems. Wind speeds were variable, with a period of calm around early morning hours but otherwise maintained moderate levels, suggesting a breezy condition that could influence coastal activities. The wind direction was predominantly from the west and north-west, which is typical for San Francisco due to its coastal location and could result in cooler oceanic air moving inland.
