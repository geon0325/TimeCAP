Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable decrease in the ratio of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) patients relative to total patient numbers, indicating a downward trend in ILI prevalence. Initially, the ILI ratio was above the baseline, suggesting a heightened level of ILI activity, but it has since fallen below the threshold, signaling a reduction in ILI cases. The highest burden of ILI is seen in the youngest age group (0-4 years), which consistently presents the highest numbers compared to other age groups, potentially due to higher susceptibility or increased contact in group settings like daycare. However, all age groups have experienced a decrease in ILI cases over the period. This trend could alleviate pressures on healthcare systems, but continued monitoring is essential to identify any changes in the pattern that may require a public health response.
