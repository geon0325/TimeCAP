Over the last 20 weeks, the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza has seen a marked increase, peaking at 27.37% in week 9 before gradually declining to 11.25% in week 20. Influenza A has been the predominant subtype throughout the season, reaching a high of 22.19% positivity in week 7, but has since decreased to 3.60% by week 20. Conversely, Influenza B showed a slower increase yet a more sustained presence, peaking later at 10.95% in week 12 and remaining higher than Influenza A at 7.65% in week 20. The trend indicates a significant wave of influenza activity with a shift from Influenza A to a relatively sustained circulation of Influenza B, which could impact healthcare resources due to prolonged influenza seasonality. The healthcare system should remain vigilant and maintain resources for testing and treatment, as the consistent presence of influenza B suggests continued risk for vulnerable populations.
