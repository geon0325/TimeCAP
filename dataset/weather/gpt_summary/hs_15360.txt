Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before starting to decline during the night. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, with notably high values during the early morning hours, which is typical for Houston's climate and could have led to a muggy feeling overnight. Air pressure remained relatively steady, with a slight downward trend, which is not indicative of any significant weather events on the horizon. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate throughout the day, with no significant gusts, suggesting a relatively calm wind pattern. The variability in wind direction indicates the presence of shifting weather systems, but without extreme changes that would suggest the onset of severe weather.
