The Influenza-like Illness (ILI) rates over the past 20 weeks have remained below the baseline threshold for determining an influenza outbreak, indicating a relatively mild flu season. The highest incidence of ILI is observed in the youngest age group (0-4 years), which could suggest increased vulnerability or higher transmission rates within this demographic. There has been a gradual decrease in the overall number of patients presenting with ILI symptoms, with the oldest age group (65 or more) consistently having the lowest number of ILI cases, suggesting that this group might be better protected, possibly due to higher vaccination rates or other preventive measures. The percentage of ILI patients among all patients has been rising in recent weeks, although it is still below the outbreak threshold, which warrants close monitoring for potential trends indicating an upcoming increase in flu activity. Healthcare systems should remain vigilant and continue to promote preventive measures, particularly focusing on the most affected age groups, to maintain control over ILI rates and prepare for any potential surge.
