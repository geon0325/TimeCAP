The data indicates a significant seasonal trend in Influenza-like Illness (ILI) with a peak that exceeds the baseline threshold, suggesting an active influenza season. There has been a noticeable decline in ILI cases across all age groups in recent weeks, with the ratio of ILI patients now falling below the baseline, which may indicate that the peak of the season has passed. The age group 5-24 has consistently shown the highest number of ILI cases, which could be attributed to high transmission rates in school and college settings. The sustained high levels earlier in the season likely placed a strain on healthcare resources, but the current downward trend is a positive sign and may lead to reduced pressure on the system. It is important to continue monitoring the data, as ILI activity can have implications for healthcare planning, resource allocation, and public health interventions.
