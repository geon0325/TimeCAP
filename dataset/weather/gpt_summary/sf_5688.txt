Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have shown a slight cooling trend during the early hours, followed by a gradual increase, suggesting a typical diurnal pattern with cooler nights and warmer days. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, reaching saturation at certain hours, which, combined with the appropriate temperatures, could have led to morning fog, a common occurrence in the region. Air pressure variations were within a narrow range, indicating stable atmospheric conditions without significant weather fronts passing through the area. Wind speeds were generally light with a few periods of increased intensity, particularly during the early hours, which may have contributed to a temporary dispersal of any coastal fog or low cloud cover. The predominant wind directions were from the west and northwest, which is typical for San Francisco's climate, influenced by maritime airflow.
