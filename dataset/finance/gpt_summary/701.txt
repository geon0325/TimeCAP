Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a general uptrend, increasing from 4363.80 to 4685.25, signaling a positive market sentiment. The VIX, which measures market volatility, has fluctuated but ended slightly lower, moving from 18.64 to 17.78, indicating that while there is some uncertainty, overall market fear has not significantly increased. The Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 also exhibited an upward trajectory, suggestive of a global confidence in equity markets, with the Nikkei closing higher at 29285.46 from an opening of 28140.28 and the FTSE advancing to 7274.00 from 7141.80. Gold futures have risen from 1793.70 to 1830.20, reflecting investor's hedging against inflation or potential market corrections. Exchange rates have remained relatively stable, with minor fluctuations in EUR/USD and USD/CNY, while USD/JPY experienced a slight decrease, which could indicate a modest shift towards the safety of the yen in currency markets.
