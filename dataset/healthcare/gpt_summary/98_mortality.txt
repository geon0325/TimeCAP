Over the last 20 weeks, the proportion of deaths due to Influenza or Pneumonia has fluctuated, with a noticeable peak at 8.33% in week 6, significantly above the 20-week average of 7.84%. Despite this peak, there has been a general downward trend in the percentage ratio of deaths from these causes since week 6, concluding at 7.02% by week 20, which is below the average. The total number of deaths has seen a slight decrease over the period, from a high of 61,090 in week 5 to 56,588 by week 20. The number of deaths attributed specifically to Influenza peaked in week 16 at 543, while pneumonia-related deaths peaked at 4,418 in week 5, both of which have since declined to 339 and 3,633 respectively by week 20. These trends suggest a reduction in mortality due to these respiratory conditions in the recent weeks, which could indicate an easing burden on healthcare resources dedicated to managing such illnesses.
