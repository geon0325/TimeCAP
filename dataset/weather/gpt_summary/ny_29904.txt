Over the last 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, reaching a low during the later hours before slightly rising again. Humidity levels varied, starting relatively low, increasing towards the middle of the period, and then hitting a sharp spike in the final hours, suggesting the possible development of a more humid or wet weather pattern. Air pressure showed a general rising trend throughout most of the day, indicative of stabilizing weather conditions, but it saw some fluctuations towards the end of the period that might signal an incoming change in weather. Wind speeds were mostly moderate but decreased in the early hours, increasing again towards the end of the period, which could affect wind chill factors, especially when combined with the lower temperatures observed. The wind direction shifted significantly throughout the period, starting from a westerly direction, veering to the north, and then shifting to easterly by the end, which may bring different air masses and potentially impact the local weather conditions.
