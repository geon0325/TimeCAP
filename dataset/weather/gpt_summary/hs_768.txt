Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have exhibited a notable diurnal pattern with warmer conditions during the day followed by cooler temperatures in the night and early morning hours. Humidity levels varied significantly, with higher humidity typically occurring alongside lower temperatures, indicative of possible morning and late-night condensation events. Air pressure remained relatively steady with only minor fluctuations, suggesting a stable atmospheric condition during the observed period. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with occasional calms; however, wind directions varied, showing that the wind came from different directions at different times, which could influence local weather patterns such as cloud cover and precipitation. The combined data implies a generally stable weather system with typical variability expected in a coastal city like Houston, but residents should be aware of the potential for higher humidity and changing wind conditions that may affect outdoor activities and comfort levels.
