Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have experienced slight fluctuations but have generally remained within a narrow band, indicating stable weather conditions. Humidity levels have been consistently high, often reaching saturation, which suggests a significant presence of moisture in the air that could lead to foggy conditions, particularly during the early hours. Atmospheric pressure has been notably stable and high, which is typically associated with fair weather and could potentially suppress the formation of precipitation. Wind speeds have been light and constant throughout the period, which might not be sufficient to disperse the atmospheric moisture, thereby maintaining the high humidity. The wind direction has stayed predominantly within a narrow range, suggesting a steady weather pattern with no significant frontal movements affecting the area.
