Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a fluctuation in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with an overall average positivity rate of 6.26%. While the number of specimens tested generally decreased from 36,559 to 24,440, the percentage of positive cases for Influenza A and B showed variability, with Influenza B consistently having a higher positivity rate than Influenza A. Notably, there was a peak in the total positivity rate at 0.20% in the first week, which then fluctuated and reached another peak at 0.15% in both weeks 16 and 17, suggesting potential waves of influenza outbreaks. The highest positivity rate for Influenza A was 0.08% in week 16, while Influenza B peaked at 0.14% in week 1. These trends indicate the need for continued surveillance and potentially increased healthcare resources to manage the fluctuating burden of influenza.
