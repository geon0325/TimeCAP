Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility but ended with a slight uptrend, closing at 3946.56 after dropping to a low of 3719.89, which indicates a recovery from mid-period losses. The VIX, often referred to as the "fear gauge," decreased from 29.69 to 23.93, suggesting a reduction in market volatility and potentially increasing investor confidence. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have demonstrated resilience, with the Nikkei making gains from its lows and the FTSE maintaining a steady upward trend, signalling strength in overseas markets. Gold Futures saw a significant increase, indicating a flight to safety or hedging against potential market risks, as they rose from 1651.00 to 1760.80. Meanwhile, Crude Oil Futures experienced a decline towards the period's end, potentially reflecting concerns over global demand or market dynamics, closing at 81.64 from an earlier high of 90.00, and currency markets showed a weakening of the USD against major pairs such as the EUR and JPY, with EUR/USD rising from 0.98 to 1.04 and USD/JPY dropping from 150.18 to 139.32, hinting at broader shifts in currency valuations that could affect international trade and investment flows.
