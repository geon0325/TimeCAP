Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a gradual rise in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon, which is typical for the region's climatic patterns. The humidity levels have fluctuated moderately, with a noticeable increase during the cooler early morning hours, which could have contributed to a feeling of increased mugginess. Air pressure has remained relatively stable but has shown a slight decreasing trend, which might indicate the approach of a weather system that could potentially lead to changes in weather conditions. Wind speeds have been consistently light to gentle, with a mild increase later in the day, suggesting that there hasn't been a significant driver for weather change from wind patterns. The wind direction has been predominantly easterly, with a subtle shift towards the southeast, which is consistent with the region's typical wind direction and could be associated with the transportation of moist Gulf air into the area.
