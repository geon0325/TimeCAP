Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, indicating a warming trend that peaked during the late afternoon hours. Humidity levels remained high through the majority of the day but showed a significant decrease during the afternoon, coinciding with the peak temperatures, which suggests the presence of drier air moving into the area. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the day, reaching its lowest value in the late evening before a sharp increase, which could signal the approach of a high-pressure system potentially leading to clearer skies. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate with some variability, but there was a noticeable increase in wind activity during the evening hours. The wind direction was variable throughout the day, with a shift towards the northwest by the end of the period, which is often associated with the arrival of cooler and drier air masses.
