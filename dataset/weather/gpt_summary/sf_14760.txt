Over the past 24 hours, the weather in San Francisco has experienced a gradual decline in temperature, which then saw a mild increase, suggesting a typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels exhibited significant fluctuation, with a notable increase during the cooler early hours, indicative of possible morning fog or mist, followed by a sharp decrease in the afternoon, which could be associated with the warmth and increased sunshine. Air pressure remained relatively stable with slight variations, but a minor decreasing trend could suggest a slight change in weather patterns or the approach of a weak weather system. Wind speeds were mostly light and variable, with a slight increase towards the end of the period, which could affect local temperature distribution and contribute to dispersal of any fog or mist. The wind direction varied widely throughout the day, implying a lack of a dominant weather front and potentially leading to variable weather conditions within short time intervals.
