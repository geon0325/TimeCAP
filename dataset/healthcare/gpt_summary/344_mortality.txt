Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable increase in the proportion of deaths attributed to influenza and pneumonia relative to total mortality, rising from 5.26% to 8.75%, which exceeds the average ratio of 7.84%. The total number of deaths peaked in the last week at 67,950, while the highest incidence of influenza-related deaths occurred 19 weeks into the period, with 1,048 deaths. Pneumonia deaths also showed an upward trend, with a peak of 4,994 in the final week of the data set. The mortality ratio from influenza or pneumonia has been consistently above the average since week 15, suggesting a potential strain on healthcare resources. This trend could indicate an atypical increase in the severity or prevalence of these respiratory conditions, signaling the need for heightened public health measures and resource allocation.
