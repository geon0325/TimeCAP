Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a significant decrease in the ratio of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with initial ratios for Influenza A and B at 16.76% and 13.39% respectively, and declining to 0.14% for both strains by the last week. This trend suggests a substantial reduction in the prevalence of influenza, with the highest combined ratio of positive specimens at 30.26% in week two, dropping significantly to just 0.28% by week 20. The number of specimens tested has also decreased over the 20-week period, from a high of 74,416 in week 7 to only 5,718 in week 20, possibly indicating a reduction in suspected influenza cases as the season progresses. Despite the overall decline, the ratios of positive specimens remained above the 20-week average of 6.26% for the first 10 weeks, indicating a potentially more active early season. The healthcare system may experience a reprieve with the current low levels of influenza activity, allowing for reallocation of resources that were previously needed to handle the higher number of cases at the beginning of the time series.
