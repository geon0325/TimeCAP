Over the last 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have experienced a slight fluctuation within a narrow range, indicative of stable weather conditions, without significant warming or cooling trends. Humidity levels reached saturation during the night, which could have led to foggy conditions, particularly given the city's coastal location and the presence of 100% humidity readings. Atmospheric pressure remained constant throughout the period, suggesting a period of settled weather without the immediate prospect of significant changes in weather patterns. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with little variation, and the prevailing winds were westerly, which is typical for San Francisco given its position on the Pacific coast. The consistent wind direction and speed, along with stable pressure and temperatures, suggest a tranquil weather pattern is currently in place over San Francisco.
