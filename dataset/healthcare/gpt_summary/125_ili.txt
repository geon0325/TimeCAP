Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a gradual increase in the percentage of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) patients across all age groups, with the sharpest rise observed in the youngest group (age 0-4). Despite the upward trend, the ratio of ILI patients has remained well below the baseline of 2.9%, suggesting that the healthcare system is not currently experiencing an overwhelming burden from ILI. The greatest absolute increase in ILI cases has been among the 0-4 and 5-24 age groups, which could point to higher transmission rates in settings frequented by children and young adults, such as schools and daycare centers. The steady rise in ILI cases in the older age groups (50-64 and 65 or more) is also noteworthy, as it may indicate increased susceptibility or exposure among these populations, necessitating careful monitoring. Overall, while the system is not yet strained by ILI, the consistent increase across all age demographics warrants continued vigilance and preparedness for a potential surge in cases.
