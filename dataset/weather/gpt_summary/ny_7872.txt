Over the last 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual rise in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before starting to decrease towards the evening. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, with a notable spike coinciding with a substantial drop in air pressure, suggesting the possibility of a brief weather event such as a storm or heavy rain during that period. The air pressure remained relatively stable outside of this event, indicating steady weather conditions for the most part. Wind speed varied throughout the day with a noticeable increase towards the end of the observed period, which could have contributed to a cooler feel in the air as the temperature began to drop. Wind direction shifted throughout the day, starting from a southerly direction, moving to westerly and then predominantly northerly before returning to southerly by the end of the period, which may have influenced the temperature and humidity variations observed.
