Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperature demonstrated a typical diurnal pattern with the lowest values recorded during the early morning hours before a gradual increase towards the afternoon, then a decrease again as night approached. Humidity levels started higher but showed a significant decrease during the day, which could be indicative of drier air moving into the area. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with a slight increase suggesting the presence of a high-pressure system that could lead to more settled weather conditions. Wind speeds varied, with stronger gusts observed towards the latter part of the time series, and the prevailing wind direction was predominantly westerly, which is common for the region and can bring in cool ocean air. These combined atmospheric conditions could imply a pattern of cool, possibly breezy weather with clear skies, typical of San Francisco's climate.
