Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the mortality due to Influenza or Pneumonia as a percentage of total deaths, with an initial increase reaching a peak of 13.74% in week 10, followed by a steady decline to 6.58% by week 20. The absolute number of deaths attributed to Influenza spiked sharply in week 11, deviating significantly from the otherwise low weekly counts, suggesting a possible outbreak or reporting anomaly. Despite this spike in influenza deaths, the overall trend for pneumonia-related deaths shows a gradual decrease, aligning with the declining percentage of total mortality due to Influenza or Pneumonia. The highest absolute numbers of pneumonia deaths align with the peak percentages of combined Influenza or Pneumonia mortality, indicating that pneumonia is the predominant factor in the observed mortality rates. The data suggests a pressure point around week 10, with potential implications for healthcare resource allocation and the need for ongoing surveillance to understand the drivers of these trends.
