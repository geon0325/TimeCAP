Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature with a general trend towards warming, indicative of a typical diurnal pattern. Humidity levels remained high throughout the period, suggesting a muggy atmosphere, which is characteristic of Houston's climate and can contribute to a feeling of discomfort among residents. Air pressure showed some variability with a notable increase towards the latter part of the observed time frame, potentially stabilizing weather conditions and possibly indicating the arrival of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, which is not likely to have a significant impact on the day-to-day activities of Houston's population. The wind direction was variable, though predominantly from the south-southeast, which is common for this region and can bring in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, affecting local weather conditions.
