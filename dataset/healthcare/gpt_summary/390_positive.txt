Over the last 20 weeks, the data shows a fluctuating but generally stable presence of influenza in the tested specimens, with an average positivity ratio slightly above the observed average at 6.26%. The highest recorded ratio of positive specimens peaked at 1.31% in week 10, indicating a potential spike in influenza cases that could have temporarily increased the burden on healthcare services. Notably, the ratio of positive specimens for Influenza B started higher than Influenza A but saw a general decline, suggesting a possible seasonal decrease or effective containment measures. In contrast, Influenza A showed an increase in positivity ratio mid-period, particularly in weeks 14 and 15, with ratios reaching 0.73% and 0.88% respectively, which could point to a shifting dominance between influenza strains. Despite these variances, the overall positivity rate has remained below 2%, indicating that influenza is not currently widespread, but healthcare providers should remain vigilant for potential shifts in infection rates.
