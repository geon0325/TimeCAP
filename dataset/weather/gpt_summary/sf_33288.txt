Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperature has remained notably stable before experiencing a mild decrease, suggesting a consistent weather pattern with a slight cooling trend possibly due to nightfall or a passing weather front. Humidity levels were mostly constant but showed a slight increase at the same time as the temperature dip, which is indicative of a typical diurnal pattern where the air cools and relative humidity increases. Air pressure gradually increased throughout the day, reaching a peak before slightly declining, which could indicate the approach of a high-pressure system followed by a slight weakening or movement of the system. Wind speed variations were minimal, with a slight decrease followed by a small increase towards the current hour, suggesting calm to light breeze conditions without significant gusts or wind events. Wind direction remained predominantly from the west-southwest with minor variations, which is typical for coastal cities like San Francisco where ocean breezes influence the local climate.
