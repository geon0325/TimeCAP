Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a slight increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before gradually beginning to cool down. Humidity levels showed considerable fluctuation; starting relatively high in the early hours, they dropped significantly during midday and then varied, suggesting the presence of changing air masses and possibly frontal activity. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with a slight decreasing trend, which could indicate the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate but picked up intensity during the evening, hinting at more active weather conditions possibly moving into the area. The wind direction shifted from predominantly southerly in the early hours to westerly and back to southerly, showing a variability that could be associated with a dynamic weather pattern affecting the city.
