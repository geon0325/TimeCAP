Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia to the total number of deaths has shown a slight decreasing trend, dropping from an initial high of 6.85% to a low of 5.19%, which is below the average ratio of 7.84%. The total number of deaths reported fluctuated, with a slight overall decrease from 61,723 to 55,682. Deaths from pneumonia consistently outnumbered those from influenza, with the highest reported pneumonia-related deaths in the first week at 4,107 and a gradual decrease to 2,868 by the final week. Influenza-related deaths also decreased from 118 to 23 over the same period. These trends indicate a relative improvement in mortality due to Influenza or Pneumonia, which could potentially alleviate some pressure on the healthcare system, but continuous monitoring is necessary to understand the long-term implications.
