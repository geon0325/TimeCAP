Over the past 20 weeks, the data indicates a progressive increase in the percentage of patients presenting with Influenza-like Illness (ILI), with the most significant uptick in the latter weeks, surpassing the baseline percentage that indicates an influenza outbreak. The age groups 0-4 and 5-24 have shown the highest number of ILI cases, suggesting a heightened vulnerability or increased transmission within these younger populations. Although all age groups demonstrated an increase in ILI cases over the period, the absolute numbers remain highest in the youngest cohorts. The steady rise in ILI percentage suggests a growing burden on the healthcare system that could potentially lead to increased hospitalizations, a need for more medical resources, and heightened public health measures. Given that the ratio of ILI patients has yet to plateau or decline, health authorities should remain vigilant and may consider implementing targeted interventions to mitigate the spread, particularly among the most affected age groups.
