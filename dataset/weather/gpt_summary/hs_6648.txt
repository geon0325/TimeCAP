Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced a rise in temperature during the daytime, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before gradually cooling towards the evening. Humidity levels varied significantly, starting high in the early hours, decreasing sharply as temperatures peaked, and increasing again towards the end of the period, suggesting a typical diurnal pattern influenced by local atmospheric conditions. Atmospheric pressure showed minor fluctuations but displayed a notable increase towards the latter part of the period, which could indicate the approach of a high-pressure system that might lead to more stable weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate throughout the day, with a few instances of higher gusts in the evening, possibly contributing to the dispersal of humidity and providing some relief from the heat. The wind direction was variable, with a tendency to shift, suggesting the presence of different weather fronts influencing the local climate.
