Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a notable drop in temperature during the night after consistent readings, indicating a typical diurnal cooling pattern. The humidity levels have fluctuated, with a peak suggesting the presence of more moisture in the air at one point, which could have been associated with a localized weather event such as fog, common in the area. Air pressure experienced a gradual decrease, followed by a sharp increase, and stabilized later, which might have led to changing weather conditions, possibly including the development of coastal breezes or fog. Wind speeds varied, with a sudden increase followed by calm conditions; these variations in wind could influence the dispersal of fog and coastal cloud formations. The wind direction was predominantly from the northwest, with occasional shifts, which is typical for San Francisco's weather patterns, affecting local temperatures and fog distribution.
