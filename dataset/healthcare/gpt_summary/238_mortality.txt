Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a concerning upward trend in the mortality rate from Influenza or Pneumonia, with the ratio to total deaths starting at 10.29% and reaching a peak of 16.24% by the last recorded week, which is significantly higher than the average ratio of 7.84%. The number of deaths attributed to pneumonia shows a substantial increase from 6534 to 13269, while deaths from influenza remained relatively low but increased from 11 to 29 cases. Notably, there was a brief dip in both the total number of deaths and the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia around the 10th week, but the subsequent weeks showed a steady rise. This elevated mortality ratio may suggest either an increase in the virulence of these respiratory diseases, a higher prevalence of cases, or possibly decreased efficacy in prevention and treatment methods. The healthcare system may need to address resource allocation, prevention strategies, and treatment protocols to manage the increasing burden of Influenza and Pneumonia on the population.
