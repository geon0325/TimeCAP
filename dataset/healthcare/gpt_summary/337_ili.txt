Over the past 20 weeks, the data indicates a progressive increase in the ratio of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) patients, moving from below baseline levels to approaching the threshold by the final week. The age group 0-4 years consistently showed the highest number of ILI cases, suggesting a heightened vulnerability or increased exposure in this demographic. The 5-24 age group experienced a significant uptick in ILI cases towards the end of the period, potentially reflecting transmission dynamics related to school attendance or group activities. Meanwhile, the age groups 25-49 and 50-64 demonstrated a mid-period peak with a subsequent decline, although there was a slight rebound in the latter weeks. Given that the ILI patient ratio is nearing the baseline threshold, health services should be prepared for a potential increase in healthcare demand, particularly pediatric services, and consider public health interventions to mitigate spread within educational settings and the broader community.
