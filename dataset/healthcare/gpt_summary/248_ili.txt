Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a marked increase in the incidence of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) across all age groups, with the most significant rise observed among patients aged 5-24. This uptrend has led to the ratio of ILI patients exceeding the baseline of 2.9% in recent weeks, reaching its peak in the middle of the observed period before showing a slight decline towards the end. The oldest age group (65 or more) has consistently shown the lowest number of ILI cases, although these too have increased over time. The elevated ILI activity suggests an increased burden on healthcare resources, necessitating preparedness in managing higher patient volumes, particularly among younger age groups. The data indicates that the healthcare system may need to prioritize strategies for infection control and vaccination, especially in educational institutions where young people are densely populated.
