Over the past day, New York City has experienced a slight decrease in temperature with a notable dip in the early hours, followed by a moderate recovery in the afternoon. Humidity levels varied significantly, peaking at full saturation during the night, which could have led to foggy conditions, and then gradually decreasing towards the end of the 24-hour period, indicating a drier atmosphere. Air pressure dropped steadily through most of the day, reaching its lowest in the night, which may have been associated with the development of a low-pressure system in the area. Wind speeds were generally light but increased towards the evening, suggesting the possibility of a weather front moving through the area. Changes in wind direction were observed, shifting from southwesterly to westerly and then to northerly by the end of the period, potentially bringing cooler air into the region.
