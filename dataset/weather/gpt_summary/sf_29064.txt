Over the last 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have experienced a mild fluctuation, with a noticeable cooling trend in the early hours, followed by a gradual warming later in the day. Relative humidity levels showed a significant increase coinciding with the cooler temperatures, indicative of a more moisture-laden air mass affecting the area. Air pressure saw an overall increase throughout the period, suggesting the strengthening of a high-pressure system in the region, which typically brings clearer and more stable weather conditions. Wind speeds varied from calm to moderate, with a period of very light winds, and the wind direction shifted from predominantly southerly to a more varied pattern, indicating a possible change in the weather system. The combination of high humidity, increasing pressure, and variable winds could suggest the presence of a marine layer influencing local weather patterns, possibly leading to morning fog or low clouds followed by clearer skies.
