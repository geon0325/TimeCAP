The Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data over the past 20 weeks shows a notable peak in the proportion of ILI cases, consistently exceeding the 2.9% severity benchmark for several weeks, with the highest rates observed in the 5-24 and 25-49 age groups. The percentage of ILI cases reached a zenith of 7.37% in week 8, indicating a significant surge that likely strained healthcare resources, necessitating increased medical attention and possibly impacting workforce productivity due to illness. Following this peak, there has been a gradual decline in ILI percentages, yet it remained above the severity threshold for 12 consecutive weeks, only dipping below the benchmark to 2.71% in week 16. The most recent data indicates a percentage of 2.64%, suggesting a downward trend in ILI cases, which could indicate relief for the healthcare system if this trajectory continues. However, the prolonged period above the threshold highlights the importance of continued surveillance and preparedness in the healthcare system to manage potential future increases in ILI cases.
