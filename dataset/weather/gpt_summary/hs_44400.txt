Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant fluctuation in temperature, with a noticeable increase during the day followed by a cooler evening. Humidity levels varied considerably, peaking at full saturation in the early hours, which could have led to fog or dew, and then dropping to much lower levels during the day, which suggests drier conditions that can be more comfortable. Air pressure showed a gradual decline through the period, indicating a possible approach of a weather system that could lead to changing weather conditions, such as increased wind speeds or precipitation. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate but did increase significantly at one point, which could have implications for short-term weather events such as sudden gusts or storms. The wind direction varied widely, suggesting an unstable atmosphere that could lead to unpredictable weather patterns in the short term.
