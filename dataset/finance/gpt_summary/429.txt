Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a general uptrend, closing higher by approximately 3.91% from 3401.20 to 3534.22, which reflects growing investor confidence or a potential recovery in market sentiment. Volatility, as measured by the VIX, has decreased slightly, indicating a reduction in market uncertainty and investor fear. The Asian and European stock indices, Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100, have shown relative instability with the Nikkei experiencing minor fluctuations and a slight downward trend, while the FTSE has struggled to recover amidst ongoing uncertainties, particularly with a sharp drop mid-period before partly recovering.

Gold Futures have seen some volatility, with a notable dip followed by a recovery, suggesting investors are still considering safe-haven assets amidst market fluctuations. Crude Oil Futures have been quite erratic, reflecting ongoing concerns about global demand and supply dynamics, while major currency pairs such as EUR/USD and USD/JPY have stayed relatively stable, indicating a current equilibrium in currency markets, although the notable appreciation of the USD against the CNY could suggest shifts in trade dynamics or policy actions.
