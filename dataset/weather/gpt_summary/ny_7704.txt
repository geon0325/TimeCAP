Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual rise in temperatures, reaching a peak during the afternoon before a modest decline by the evening. Meanwhile, humidity levels have varied, with a general increase through the night which slightly dropped during the day, indicative of some moisture in the air that could contribute to a feeling of mugginess. Atmospheric pressure showed a slow decreasing trend suggesting a potential change in weather patterns, such as an approaching weather system. Wind speeds remained low throughout the period, with little to no variation, suggesting a relatively calm wind condition. The wind direction shifted from southeasterly to northeasterly before becoming easterly, which may influence coastal conditions and potentially bring in marine air masses.
