Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual decline in temperature, followed by a moderate increase, suggesting a typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels showed an increasing trend during the night hours, which is common as temperatures drop, and then fluctuated throughout the day, with some periods of lower humidity that could have provided temporary relief from the mugginess. Air pressure remained relatively stable with only minor fluctuations, indicating no significant weather fronts moving through the area that could lead to drastic weather changes. Wind speeds varied, with occasional gusts, but overall maintained a light to moderate pace, which likely had a minimal impact on the perceived temperature. Wind direction was predominantly from the west to northwest, with a temporary shift to calm conditions, which is consistent with the approach and passage of a weak front or local breeze effects.
