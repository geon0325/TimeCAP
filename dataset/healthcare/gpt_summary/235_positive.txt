Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable decline in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for both Influenza A and B, with initial ratios of 0.38% and 0.24% respectively, decreasing to 0.10% and 0.13% in the latest week. The overall ratio of positive specimens has decreased significantly from the beginning of the time series, with a high of 0.62% to a low of 0.13% in the penultimate week, before a slight increase to 0.22% in the last week. Despite a decrease in testing volumes from 19,572 to 6,238 specimens, the ratios of positivity have shown a consistent downward trend, suggesting a reduction in influenza activity. This trend is important for healthcare resource allocation, indicating a potential decrease in the demand for influenza-related healthcare services. However, the slight uptick in the percentage of positive specimens in the last week warrants close monitoring to determine if it signifies a transient fluctuation or the beginning of an upward trend in influenza cases.
