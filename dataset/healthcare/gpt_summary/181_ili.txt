Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable increase in the percentage of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) among patients, with a consistent upward trend that remains below the baseline of 2.9% for heightened influenza activity. This increase is observed across all age groups, with the most significant rise noted in the 0-4 and 5-24 age categories, which could suggest higher transmission rates in settings like schools and daycares. Despite the overall growth in ILI cases, the ratio of ILI patients has not yet reached a level that would typically signal an epidemic, but the steady climb indicates a need for ongoing surveillance and preparedness within the healthcare system. The proportionate increase in ILI cases among older adults (65 or more) is less pronounced, which might reflect better immunity or vaccination rates in this demographic. Healthcare providers should remain vigilant and continue to encourage preventative measures, such as vaccination and hygienic practices, especially among the younger population where the increase in ILI cases is most prominent.
