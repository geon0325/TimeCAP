Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual decline in temperature followed by a rise, suggesting a typical diurnal temperature variation with warmer conditions during the day easing into cooler temperatures at night. Humidity levels have fluctuated significantly, with notably high values during the early morning hours that decreased as the day progressed, which is typical of the natural humidity cycle and may have contributed to periods of mugginess followed by drier conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, indicating that there were no major weather systems influencing the area that would cause dramatic changes in pressure. Wind speeds varied modestly, with a period of calm conditions during the night, and a later increase suggesting the passage of a weather system or the influence of local breezes. Wind direction shifts were observed, with a notable change from primarily westerly directions to a brief period of northerly and easterly winds, and then returning to westerly, which could be associated with the movement of local weather systems or variations in regional air flow patterns.
