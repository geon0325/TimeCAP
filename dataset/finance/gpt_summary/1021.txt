Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with an initial decline followed by a recovery, peaking at 4179.76 before retracting slightly to close at 4079.09. The VIX, which measures market volatility, has fluctuated, indicating a persistent sense of investor uncertainty, ending the period slightly above its starting point. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 have both trended upwards, suggesting a more positive outlook in these markets, with the FTSE 100 reaching a new high of 8012.50. Gold futures experienced a drop mid-period but have since stabilized, reflecting a possible safe-haven demand amidst market fluctuations.
