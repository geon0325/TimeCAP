Over the past 20 weeks, the ratio of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza has fluctuated, with the overall average ratio being 6.26%, but individual weekly ratios ranging from a low of 0.78% to a high of 3.02%. The data shows that Influenza B has been the dominant strain throughout the period, with its peak positivity rate at 2.26% in the first week, and consistently higher than Influenza A, except in the 11th and 12th weeks where Influenza A showed a notable increase. Despite this, there has been a gradual decline in the positivity rate for both strains from the initial weeks to a stabilization around the 20th week, with Influenza A at a positivity rate of 0.76% and Influenza B at 0.64%. The highest number of specimens tested occurred in the last week at 15,110, suggesting increased testing efforts or possibly a rise in respiratory illness leading to more individuals being tested. The healthcare system should be mindful of these trends for resource allocation, potential vaccination campaigns, and public health advisories, especially considering the possibility of a resurgence given the latest stabilization of positivity rates rather than a continued decline.
