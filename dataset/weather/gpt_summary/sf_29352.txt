Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature during the nighttime hours, reaching its lowest point shortly after dawn, followed by a noticeable warming trend through the afternoon. Humidity levels showed significant variation, with a marked decrease during the day, likely contributing to the sensation of drier conditions, and a subsequent increase by evening, which may lead to a more noticeable dampness in the air. Atmospheric pressure has been on a slight declining trend throughout the period, which could indicate the approach of a weather system that might alter current conditions. Wind speeds have remained relatively light to moderate, with some increase during daylight hours, and wind direction has been variable, including a notable shift to southerly and westerly winds in the afternoon. These combined factors suggest a stable weather pattern with a typical diurnal cycle for San Francisco but with potential for changes due to the decreasing pressure.
