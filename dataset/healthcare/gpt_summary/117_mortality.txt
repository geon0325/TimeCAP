Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a consistent decline in the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, with the percentage dropping from 7.02% to 5.12%. This decrease indicates a downward trend in deaths attributed to these illnesses relative to overall mortality. During this period, the actual number of deaths from Influenza has shown a significant reduction, starting at 339 deaths and falling to just 8 in the latest week. However, deaths from Pneumonia have remained relatively high, starting at 3633 and decreasing moderately to 2601. The steady decline in the mortality ratio suggests improvements in managing these respiratory conditions or a possible shift in the pattern of prevalent causes of death, which could impact healthcare priorities and resource allocation.
