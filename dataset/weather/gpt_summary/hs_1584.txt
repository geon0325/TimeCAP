Despite typical fluctuations, humidity levels have generally decreased slightly, which may have contributed to more comfortable conditions, especially as the temperatures rose. Air pressure has been on a subtle declining path, which could suggest the potential for changing weather patterns or the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds were mostly light and variable, with a notable increase in the latter part of the period, which may signal the approach of a frontal system or a shift in weather conditions. The wind direction shifted frequently but predominantly came from the north and east, suggesting variable weather influences and the possibility of maritime air affecting local conditions.
