Over the past 20 weeks, the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) activity has shown a consistent decline after reaching a peak in the ratio of ILI patients, which was well above the 2.9% severity benchmark for several weeks. The highest reported ILI percentage was 7.37% in week 4, indicating a significant strain on healthcare resources during that period. The age group of 0-4 consistently had the highest number of ILI cases, suggesting that young children were the most affected demographic. However, all age groups have experienced a decreasing trend in ILI cases, with the current ILI percentage dropping below the severity threshold to 2.44% in the latest week. This decline suggests a possible easing of the healthcare burden, but continuous monitoring is essential to manage resources effectively and prepare for potential future increases in ILI activity.
