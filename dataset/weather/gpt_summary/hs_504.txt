Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak during the late afternoon hours before slowly declining. Humidity levels started high, which is typical for early morning hours, but significantly decreased as the temperature rose, indicating a correlation between rising temperatures and dropping humidity levels. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with only minor fluctuations, suggesting a stable atmospheric condition. Wind speeds varied, with a noticeable increase towards the evening, which could have contributed to the dispersal of humidity and a slight cooling effect. The wind direction was predominantly from the south to southeast, which is common for Houston and can bring in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, potentially impacting the local weather with increased humidity or cloud cover.
