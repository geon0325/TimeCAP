Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced relatively stable temperatures, maintaining a narrow range that indicates a lack of significant frontal activity or dramatic weather changes. Humidity levels have been predominantly saturated, suggesting a presence of moisture in the atmosphere that could lead to foggy conditions or potential precipitation if temperatures were to drop. The air pressure has shown a slight but consistent decrease throughout the period, which could signify a gradual approach of a weather system that may alter the current conditions. Wind speeds have been mostly light to moderate, with no indication of strong gusts or windy conditions that might influence the weather patterns severely. The wind direction has been variable but predominantly easterly to southeasterly, which is typical for this region and may contribute to the moisture-laden air coming from the Gulf of Mexico.
