Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual decrease in temperature which later stabilized and increased slightly towards the end of the period. Humidity levels were relatively low at the start but significantly increased, maintaining high levels for the majority of the day, which could lead to a perception of cooler temperatures and possible morning fog. Air pressure saw a steady increment, suggesting stable weather conditions and a lower likelihood of precipitation. Wind speeds varied, starting moderately and increasing at times, which might have contributed to the dispersion of any fog or low-lying clouds. The wind direction was predominantly westerly, with some variability, which is typical for coastal San Francisco and can affect coastal fog patterns.
