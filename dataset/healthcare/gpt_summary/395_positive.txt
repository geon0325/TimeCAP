Over the past 20 weeks, the number of respiratory specimens tested for influenza has shown a general increasing trend, starting at 52,888 and rising to 58,288, with a temporary decline around weeks 5 through 8. Despite the increasing number of tests, the overall percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza has decreased from an initial peak of 1.18% in week 3 to 0.79% in week 20, falling below the 20-week average ratio of positive specimens (6.26%). Influenza A positivity showed an early peak at 0.88% in week 10 and has since fluctuated, ending slightly lower at 0.54% in week 20. In contrast, Influenza B started at a higher positivity rate of 0.78% in week 3 but experienced a more consistent decline to 0.25% in week 20. The decreasing positivity rates for both Influenza A and B suggest a downward trend in influenza incidence, which may indicate a reduction in the influenza burden on the healthcare system, although continuous monitoring is essential to account for potential seasonal variations or resurgence.
