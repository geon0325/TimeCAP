Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon, indicating a typically warm day transitioning into evening. Humidity levels have shown significant fluctuation, with a notable peak during the early morning hours, which may have contributed to a feeling of mugginess, especially when the temperature was also high. Air pressure remained relatively stable with only minor fluctuations, staying within a range indicative of settled weather without the immediate likelihood of significant weather disturbances. Wind speeds were generally light and variable, with occasional modest increases that are unlikely to have had a substantial impact on local conditions. The wind direction varied widely throughout the day, suggesting the presence of a changing weather system, yet without the consistency to suggest a strong weather front moving through the area.
