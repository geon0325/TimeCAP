Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have exhibited a slight fluctuation with a general cooling trend, followed by a modest warming towards the later hours. Humidity levels have remained high throughout the period, peaking at full saturation, which could have contributed to foggy conditions and a damp atmosphere. Atmospheric pressure has been relatively stable, showing a slight increasing trend, indicating steady weather patterns without the immediate approach of significant weather fronts. Wind speeds have been moderate and consistent, with only a minor decrease in intensity, and the wind direction has been predominantly from the west-northwest. The combination of high humidity, stable pressure, and steady winds from the ocean is typical of San Francisco's microclimate, potentially leading to persistent fog, especially along the coast and in the early hours.
