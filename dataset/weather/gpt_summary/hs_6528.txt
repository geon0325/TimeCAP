Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a notable decrease in temperature, followed by a gradual increase, suggesting a transition from warmer to cooler conditions and back to warmth. Humidity levels have fluctuated significantly, with a peak during the cooler nighttime hours, typical of diurnal patterns. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase in the middle of the period, likely indicating the presence of a high-pressure system that could be associated with clearer skies. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with some variability, but without any strong gusts that would suggest stormy conditions. The wind direction shifted throughout the day, including a notable change to a westerly direction, which in Houston, could be associated with the arrival of a front that might have contributed to the observed temperature changes.
