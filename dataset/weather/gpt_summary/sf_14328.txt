Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual increase in temperature followed by a slight decrease and then a secondary increase, suggesting typical diurnal temperature variation with warmer conditions expected during the day. Humidity levels have fluctuated significantly, with higher levels during the cooler early hours, which is common as cooler air tends to hold more moisture. Air pressure has shown minor variations but did undergo a notable dip before returning to earlier levels, possibly indicating a transient weather system passing through the area. Wind speeds have been mostly light to moderate, with a couple of instances of higher wind speeds, which could have contributed to changes in humidity and pressure levels. The wind direction has been variable, with a general tendency towards westerly and southwesterly directions, which is characteristic for coastal cities like San Francisco due to oceanic influences.
