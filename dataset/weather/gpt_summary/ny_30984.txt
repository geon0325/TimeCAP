Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, indicating a warming trend into the daytime hours after a cooler night. The humidity levels exhibited a significant fluctuation; they were higher during the early hours, dropped considerably during the day, and then increased slightly towards the latter part of the period, which is typical as temperatures tend to lower. Air pressure has remained relatively stable with only slight variations, maintaining values that suggest settled weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally light and variable throughout the day, with a noticeable increase towards the end of the period. Finally, wind direction shifted from southeasterly in the early hours to a more northerly direction before settling into a pattern that oscillated between northerly and easterly directions, which could influence local conditions such as temperature and precipitation patterns.
