Over the last 20 weeks, the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases across all age groups have remained below the 2.9% severity benchmark, with the highest ratio of ILI patients being 2.21% in the first week and a gradual decline reaching a minimum of 1.19% in the fifteenth week. The total number of patients presenting with ILI symptoms has experienced a general downward trend in all age categories, with the most significant decreases observed in the younger populations (Age 0-4 and 5-24). Notably, there has been a slight uptick in ILI cases in the most recent weeks across all age groups, indicating a potential reversal of the declining trend. The healthcare system has not been overwhelmed by ILI cases during this period, as the ratios have stayed well below the threshold for high severity. However, the recent increase in ILI cases warrants close monitoring to ensure readiness for a potential surge and to maintain adequate healthcare resources.
