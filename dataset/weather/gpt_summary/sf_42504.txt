Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature, with a general trend of cooling overnight followed by a gradual warming towards the afternoon. Humidity levels varied significantly, with a notable peak coinciding with the lowest temperatures, indicative of a possible fog event, particularly around dawn when humidity reached saturation. Air pressure remained steady throughout the period, suggesting stable weather conditions without the presence of significant fronts or storm systems. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with a notable increase during the early morning hours, which could have contributed to the dispersal of any overnight fog or low cloud cover. The wind direction shifted several times but predominantly came from the west-northwest, which is common for San Francisco due to its coastal location and the influence of the Pacific Ocean.
