Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has shown a fluctuating pattern with a general trend of cooling overnight and warming during the day, as expected. Relative humidity levels have been inversely related to the temperature readings, reaching saturation during the coolest hours, which might have led to fog or dew formation. Atmospheric pressure has remained relatively stable with a slight increase observed, indicating steady weather conditions with no significant frontal systems passing through the area. Wind speeds have been moderate with occasional gusts, and the predominant wind direction has been from the south to south-southwest, which is typical for Houston and may contribute to bringing in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. Overall, these conditions suggest a stable weather pattern without the presence of any immediate severe weather threats.
