Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a fluctuating trend in the incidence of influenza with a peak ratio of positive specimens at 24.73% in week 8, followed by a gradual decline to 4.86% in week 20. Influenza A has been the predominant strain throughout the period, with its highest positivity rate of 20.21% in week 6, which then decreased to 1.51% by the end of the 20-week period. Conversely, Influenza B showed a later peak in week 14 with a positivity rate of 11.26%, and although it also followed a decreasing trend, its decline was less steep, finishing at 3.35% in week 20. The overall decrease in the ratio of positive specimens suggests a decline in influenza activity, which may lead to a reduced burden on healthcare resources. However, the persistent presence of Influenza B and its slower rate of decline relative to Influenza A could indicate a need for continued vigilance and resource allocation for the management and prevention of influenza B infections.
