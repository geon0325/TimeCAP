Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, peaking in the late afternoon before a slight decrease towards the evening. Humidity levels were variable, starting moderately before rising significantly, which may have contributed to a muggy feeling, particularly when the temperature was at its peak. Air pressure showed a declining trend throughout the day, which can be associated with the development of unstable weather conditions, possibly leading to cloud formation or precipitation. Wind speeds were generally light to gentle, with some variability in the direction, primarily shifting between southeasterly and easterly directions. The combination of rising temperatures, fluctuating humidity, and decreasing air pressure could imply an increased likelihood of transient weather patterns, such as afternoon thunderstorms or showers.
