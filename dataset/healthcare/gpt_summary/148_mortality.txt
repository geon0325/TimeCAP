Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable increase in the proportion of deaths attributable to influenza or pneumonia, rising from 5.70% to 8.63%, which exceeds the average mortality ratio of 7.84%. This trend reflects a growing impact of these respiratory conditions on overall mortality. The most significant week-over-week increases in influenza or pneumonia deaths were observed between weeks 8 and 9, where the ratio jumped from 6.74% to 7.55%, coinciding with a spike in influenza deaths from 141 to 432. In the most recent week, the ratio of mortality from these conditions peaked at 8.63%, driven by an increase in pneumonia deaths to 4543, the highest in the observed period. This upward trend may indicate a need for heightened surveillance and response efforts in the healthcare system to manage the burden of these respiratory diseases.
