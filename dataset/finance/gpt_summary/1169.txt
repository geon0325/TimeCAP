Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a general downward trend, falling from a peak of 4515.77 to 4330.00, reflecting increased market uncertainty or negative investor sentiment. The VIX, or Volatility Index, has increased from 17.20 to 17.54, with fluctuations indicating periods of heightened market stress, particularly towards the end of the period. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have experienced volatility with the Nikkei showing a decline in the latter part of the period and the FTSE reaching a high of 7731.70 before falling back to 7678.60, suggesting region-specific factors are also at play. Gold Futures have remained relatively stable with slight upward movement, closing at 1919.20, which could signal investor caution and a hedge against market volatility. Exchange rates have seen the USD strengthening against the JPY (from 144.67 to 148.32) and remaining relatively stable against the CNY, while the EUR/USD pair has seen the Euro weakening against the Dollar, closing the period at 1.07, all of which may influence international trade dynamics and cross-border investment flows.
