Over the last 20 weeks, the data shows a significant fluctuation in the incidence of Influenza-like Illness (ILI), with the ratio of ILI patients starting above the baseline and reaching a peak before declining steadily to below the baseline threshold. The highest rates of ILI were observed in the younger age groups, particularly in patients aged 5-24, which could suggest a higher transmission rate or greater susceptibility within this demographic. A noticeable decreasing trend in ILI cases across all age groups is evident in the latter weeks, indicating a potential easing of the ILI burden on the healthcare system. Despite this decline, the healthcare system should remain vigilant, as ILI ratios above the baseline in the earlier weeks could signal the possibility of future outbreaks, necessitating continued monitoring and preventive measures. The data underscores the importance of targeted interventions for age groups that are most affected and may benefit from increased educational outreach on prevention and early treatment options.
