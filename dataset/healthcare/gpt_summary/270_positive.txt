Over the last 20 weeks, the data show a general decline in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a peak in week 2 for Influenza B (0.20%) and a relatively steady presence of Influenza A, albeit at low levels. The highest overall positivity rate was observed early in the time-series at 0.29% in week 2, which has since decreased to 0.09% in the most recent week, indicating a downward trend in influenza cases. The consistent but low positivity rates for Influenza A suggest it remains a persistent but not dominant strain in the tested population. In contrast, the higher but decreasing positivity rates for Influenza B indicate it was more prevalent initially, but its impact has lessened over time. This overall decline in influenza positivity suggests a current easing burden on healthcare resources specific to influenza management, but continued surveillance is essential to monitor for potential fluctuations or new outbreaks.
