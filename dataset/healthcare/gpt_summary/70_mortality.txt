Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a consistent decline in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia when compared to the total number of deaths, starting at 5.92% and decreasing to a low of 5.21% before slightly rising to 5.49% in the most recent week. This trend indicates a decrease in the impact of Influenza and Pneumonia on overall mortality. The total number of deaths fluctuated within a relatively narrow range, with a minimum of 50274 and a maximum of 52105. Deaths specifically due to Influenza have significantly declined from 53 to 11 deaths per week, suggesting a positive trend in controlling Influenza-related mortality. However, deaths from Pneumonia have shown less variability, with a slight decrease over the period from 3032 to 2819 deaths per week, implying that Pneumonia remains a more consistent contributor to mortality and may require ongoing healthcare focus.
