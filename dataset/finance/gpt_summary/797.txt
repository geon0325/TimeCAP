Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown signs of recovery, climbing from 4386.54 to 4631.60, indicating a return of investor confidence or a bullish sentiment. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, has trended downwards from 30.74 to 18.90, suggesting a decrease in investor fear and market risk perception. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 indices have followed a similar upward trajectory, indicating a positive sentiment in both Asian and European markets. Gold futures have seen a decline from 1920.90 to 1912.00, which can imply a shift of investor preference from safe-haven assets to riskier investments amid market recovery. In the currency markets, the EUR/USD has remained relatively flat, indicating stability, while the USD has appreciated against both the JPY and CNY, from 114.83 to 123.66 and 6.31 to 6.37 respectively, which could point to a stronger dollar environment.
