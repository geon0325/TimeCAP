Humidity levels saw a significant increase overnight, peaking towards the morning, which could have led to foggy conditions typical of the San Francisco Bay Area.

Wind speeds were mostly light and variable, with no significant gusts that would impact outdoor activities or conditions at sea. The wind direction was predominantly from the west-southwest, which is common for the region and consistent with the prevailing maritime influence on San Francisco's climate.
