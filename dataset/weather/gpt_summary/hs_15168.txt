Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperature trends showed a gradual increase reaching a peak in the late afternoon before slightly dropping off towards the evening. Humidity levels were consistently high, suggesting a muggy and potentially uncomfortable atmosphere, but saw a significant decrease in the later hours, which may have offered some relief. Air pressure experienced some fluctuations with a notable dip, possibly indicating the movement of a weather system through the area. Wind speeds were generally light to calm, with no significant gusts that would impact conditions drastically. The wind direction varied but predominantly came from the east to southeast, shifting more southerly later on, which is typical for the region and could influence the transportation of moisture into the area.
