Over the last 24 hours in New York City, temperatures have shown a gradual increase, reaching a peak in the later hours before a slight decrease, indicating a warmer trend throughout the day. Humidity levels have fluctuated modestly, with a notable increase during the cooler early hours, which is typical as cooler air can hold less moisture. Air pressure has remained relatively stable with minor variations, suggesting steady weather conditions without significant fronts moving through the area. Wind speeds have been consistently light to gentle, with a slight decrease as the day progressed, which may have contributed to the increase in temperature due to less wind chill. The wind direction was predominantly from the south-southwest, shifting more westerly later in the day, which could have brought warmer air from those directions, contributing to the overall increase in temperature.
