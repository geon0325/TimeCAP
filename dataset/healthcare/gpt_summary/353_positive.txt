Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a significant upward trend in both the number of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza and the positivity rate, indicating a growing prevalence of the illness. Influenza A has been the predominant strain, with its positivity rate increasing from 0.71% to 25.70%, while Influenza B has remained a relatively minor contributor, with rates fluctuating between 0.04% and 0.13%. The total ratio of positive specimens has markedly increased from 0.79% in the first week to 25.81% in the last week, with the most substantial weekly increase observed between weeks 15 and 16 when the positivity rate jumped from 5.44% to 8.38%. The highest number of specimens tested occurred in week 20, coinciding with the highest recorded positivity rate, suggesting increased testing alongside growing infection rates. This trend could strain healthcare resources due to a higher number of individuals requiring medical attention and could also indicate the need for increased preventive measures, such as vaccination and public health interventions.
