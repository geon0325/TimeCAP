Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable decrease in temperature, particularly during the early morning hours, which is typical as the city transitions from night to day. Humidity levels fluctuated dramatically, reaching saturation at one point, which may have resulted in foggy conditions, a common occurrence in this coastal city. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight variability that indicates normal weather patterns without any significant frontal activity. Wind speeds were predominantly light but did show an increase during the latter part of the day, which may have helped to clear any fog or low clouds. The wind direction varied throughout the day, with winds coming from multiple directions, suggesting the presence of localized weather systems moving through the area.
