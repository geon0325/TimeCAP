Humidity levels started moderately high and fluctuated throughout the day, with a noticeable drop in the afternoon, possibly contributing to more comfortable conditions despite the higher temperatures. Air pressure remained relatively stable and high, indicating settled weather conditions, with a minor decrease towards the end of the period. Wind speeds were consistently light, with very little variation, suggesting a calm period without significant gusts or wind-related weather events. Wind direction was predominantly from the northeast, with a brief shift to the north-northwest around midday, remaining fairly consistent otherwise, which could have influenced the cooling trend observed in the morning hours.
