Over the past 24 hours, the temperature in San Francisco has shown moderate fluctuations, beginning in a mild range, dipping slightly during the earlier hours, and then rising again towards the end of the observed period. Humidity levels started relatively high and increased to saturation midway through the period, suggesting the possibility of fog or mist, particularly during the cooler early hours. Air pressure has been notably stable, with only a slight increase, indicating steady weather conditions without the immediate approach of significant weather systems. Wind speeds have been consistently light, which would not likely contribute to major wind chill effects or impact the dispersion of any fog that formed. The wind direction was generally from the west-northwest, which is typical for San Francisco, though there was a brief period when the wind shifted to come from a more southerly direction before returning to its original pattern.
