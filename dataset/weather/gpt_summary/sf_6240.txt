Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, a gradual decrease in temperature was observed, reaching its lowest point during the night, followed by a rise towards the late afternoon. Humidity levels remained high throughout the period, peaking during the cooler early morning hours, which could have led to foggy conditions typical of the San Francisco Bay Area. Air pressure showed a decreasing trend, suggesting the potential development of a low-pressure system that may bring unsettled weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, but there was an increase during the afternoon, which may have contributed to a more significant wind chill effect and possibly dispersed any fog or low clouds. The wind direction varied, predominantly coming from the west-northwest, which is common for the region and may influence coastal temperatures and fog patterns.
