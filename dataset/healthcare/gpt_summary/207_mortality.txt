Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable decline in the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, starting at a high of 19.40% and reducing to below the 20-week average of 7.84%, reaching 7.78% in the final week. The total number of deaths has decreased slightly over this period, with a peak at the second week (86888) and a gradual decline to 58334 by the twentieth week. Deaths from pneumonia have significantly decreased from a peak of 16884 in the third week to 4529 in the last week, while deaths from influenza have remained relatively low, with a slight peak at 203 in the first week and then hovering at or below 36 in subsequent weeks. The reduction in the mortality ratio for these respiratory conditions could indicate improvements in prevention, treatment, or a seasonal decline in incidence. This trend may alleviate some pressures on healthcare resources but warrants continuous monitoring for potential resurgences or shifts in patterns.
