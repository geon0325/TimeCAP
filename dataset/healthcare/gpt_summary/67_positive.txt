Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable decline in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the peak positivity rate at 24.51% in week 5 decreasing to 4.17% by week 20. The incidence of Influenza A, which dominated the early weeks, has decreased from a high of 20.21% to a low of 1.47%, indicating a significant reduction in its prevalence. Conversely, Influenza B showed an increasing trend up until week 14, where it peaked at 11.26%, before declining to 2.70% by week 20. While the overall ratio of positive specimens has been decreasing, the ratio of Influenza B remained relatively higher than Influenza A for several weeks, suggesting a shift in the dominant strain over the course of the surveillance period. These trends are critical for healthcare providers to adjust resource allocation and for public health officials to update vaccination and prevention strategies accordingly.
