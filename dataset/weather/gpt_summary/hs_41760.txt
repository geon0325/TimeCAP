Humidity levels were variable, starting at moderate levels in the early hours, spiking to saturation towards the middle of the day, and then decreasing, indicating a possibility of morning dew or fog that cleared as the day progressed. The air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with a slight drop toward the end, which could signal an approaching change in weather patterns. Wind speeds were mostly light to gentle and showed an increase in the later hours, which might contribute to a cooling effect, particularly when the temperatures were at their highest.
