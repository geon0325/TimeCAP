Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have experienced subtle fluctuations, with a general trend toward cooling after a mild peak during the day. Humidity levels have been high, indicating a moist air mass over the region, which could contribute to overcast skies or the presence of fog, particularly during the early morning or late evening when temperatures are lower. Atmospheric pressure has remained relatively stable, suggesting steady weather conditions without significant short-term changes. Wind speeds have gradually increased, which could enhance the chill factor and contribute to the dispersal of any fog or low clouds, and the wind direction has been predominantly from the south, shifting slightly towards the southeast. This wind pattern is typical for the area and can affect coastal conditions and temperatures across the city.
