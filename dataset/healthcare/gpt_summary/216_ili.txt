The time-series data for Influenza-like Illness (ILI) over the last 20 weeks indicates a decreasing trend in the ratio of ILI patients, which has now dropped below the baseline threshold of 2.9%. This suggests a decline in the prevalence of ILI symptoms within the population. All age groups have experienced a reduction in the number of ILI cases, with the highest counts consistently found in the younger age groups (0-4 and 5-24 years) throughout the period. The consistent decrease across all age demographics points towards an ebbing phase of the ILI season or effective control measures. Despite this overall positive trend, healthcare systems should remain vigilant, as ILI trends can be unpredictable and may require rapid response in case of an unexpected uptick in cases.
