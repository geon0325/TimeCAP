Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a fluctuating trend in the mortality ratio of Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, with the ratio peaking at 9.15% in week 8, which is significantly higher than the 20-week average of 7.84%. This indicates periods of increased burden on healthcare resources due to respiratory illnesses. The total number of deaths reached a high in week 5 and has since shown a general decline, with week 20 recording the lowest total deaths. Despite this overall decrease in total mortality, the number of deaths attributed to Influenza spiked in week 4, suggesting a possible outbreak or increased virulence of the influenza virus during that period. The persistent elevation of the mortality ratio above the average in the middle weeks signals a need for continued vigilance and preparedness in healthcare settings to manage respiratory infections effectively.
