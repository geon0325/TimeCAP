Over the past 20 weeks, the data indicates a significant upward trend in the number of respiratory specimens testing positive for both Influenza A and B, with the overall positivity ratio increasing from 2.76% to 30.15%. Influenza A showed a marked increase from 1.08% to 16.76% in positive specimen ratio, while Influenza B also rose substantially from 1.68% to 13.39% during the same period. The sharpest weekly increases in positivity rates occurred in the latter half of the 20-week span, suggesting a rapid escalation of influenza transmission. The total number of specimens tested showed an upward trend, peaking at 72,224 in the final week, which may reflect increased testing in response to the growing prevalence of influenza cases. This growing trend in flu positivity rates could indicate a looming burden on the healthcare system, necessitating preparedness for increased hospital admissions, resource allocation, and potentially reviving public health measures to mitigate the spread.
