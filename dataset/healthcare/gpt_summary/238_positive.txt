Over the last 20 weeks, the overall percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza in the data provided is below the average ratio of 6.26%, indicating a lower incidence of influenza detections in this period. The highest percentage of positive influenza specimens occurred in week 8 at 0.38%, while the lowest was in week 15 at 0.13%. Influenza A showed a decreasing trend in positivity rate, from a peak of 0.19% in week 1 to consistently low levels around 0.10% towards the end of the period, while Influenza B exhibited a more variable pattern with two peaks at 0.17% in week 2 and 0.20% in week 19. The number of specimens tested fluctuated, reaching a minimum of 5247 in week 8 and a maximum of 10268 in week 1, which could influence weekly positivity rates. The relatively low prevalence of influenza detected suggests that there may be a reduced burden on healthcare resources for influenza; however, ongoing surveillance is essential to monitor for potential outbreaks and shifts in trends.
