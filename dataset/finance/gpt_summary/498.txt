Over the past 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a general upward trend, closing higher by approximately 4.5% from 3687.26 to 3853.07, indicating a positive sentiment among investors. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, has mostly decreased from 24.23 to 21.32, suggesting that investor anxiety has lessened, which typically corresponds with rising stock prices. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 also reflected bullish trends, with the Nikkei gaining 8.8%, signaling strong performance in Asian markets, and the FTSE 100 showing a less pronounced but still positive movement, indicative of cautious optimism in European markets. Gold Futures saw heightened volatility, initially increasing to 1952.70 before retracting to 1865.30, possibly reflecting investor uncertainty and a hedge against market fluctuations. Currency markets showed a slight weakening of the US dollar against the Euro and Japanese Yen but remained relatively stable against the Chinese Yuan, which may affect multinational companies' earnings and international trade dynamics.
