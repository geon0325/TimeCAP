Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperature experienced a diurnal cycle with a decrease after the warmest part of the day, reaching its lowest point in the early hours before sunrise and then rising again. Humidity levels varied, with higher humidity in the early morning and lower levels during the afternoon, which is typical due to the daily temperature changes. The air pressure remained relatively stable for most of the period but showed a significant drop towards the end of the 24-hour cycle, potentially indicating an approaching weather system that could change current conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with occasional higher gusts, and the wind direction shifted throughout the day, ranging from calm conditions to northwesterly and easterly breezes. These variations in wind could influence coastal conditions and may affect fog development or dispersal along the bay.
