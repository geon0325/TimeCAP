Over the last 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have seen a noticeable dip during the later hours, a typical pattern that reflects the city's coastal climate with cooler nights. Humidity levels experienced a significant increase coinciding with the decrease in temperature, suggesting the possible influence of marine air or the onset of a marine layer, which is common in this region. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable with only slight fluctuations, indicating a period of steady weather without the immediate approach of any significant weather systems. Wind speeds were generally light but showed an increase towards the end of the 24-hour period, which could signal a change in weather patterns or the arrival of a new air mass. Wind direction varied, with no dominant pattern, which is characteristic of the variable winds the city can experience due to its geographical location and topographical influences.
