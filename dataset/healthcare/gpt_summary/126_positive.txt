Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable decline in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for both influenza A and B, with a peak positivity ratio of 15.69% in week 1, which gradually decreased to 1.05% by week 20. Influenza B started with a higher ratio of positive specimens but saw a more pronounced reduction over time, dropping from 8.62% to 0.22%, suggesting a significant decrease in prevalence or potentially effective containment and treatment measures. In contrast, positive specimens for Influenza A have shown a less steep decline, ending at 0.83% in week 20, indicating a persistent presence in the population. The overall testing volume also decreased over the period, from 40,978 specimens in week 1 to 6,835 in week 20, which may reflect a declining trend in respiratory illness presentations or a shift in testing strategies. These trends suggest a possible easing of the healthcare burden related to influenza but also necessitate continued surveillance to monitor for potential resurgences and to support public health strategies.
