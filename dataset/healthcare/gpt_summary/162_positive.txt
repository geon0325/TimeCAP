Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant fluctuation in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a noticeable peak in the ratio of positive tests during weeks 13 to 15, reaching over 25%. The prevalence of Influenza A has been considerably higher than Influenza B throughout the period, dominating the positive cases, though both subtypes showed an overall increasing trend until a recent decline in the last few weeks. The week-to-week increase in positive specimens for Influenza A was particularly steep between weeks 4 and 7, coinciding with an increase from 5.71% to 15.79% in positive test ratios. Despite the recent downward trend, the ratio of positive specimens for Influenza B has actually increased in the last three weeks, suggesting a potential shift in the dominant strain. This pattern indicates a substantial burden on the healthcare system, potentially necessitating increased resources for testing, vaccination efforts, and patient care, especially during peak periods of influenza activity.
