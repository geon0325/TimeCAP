Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures exhibited a typical diurnal pattern, with a peak during the daytime and a gradual decrease through the night into the early morning hours. Humidity levels remained relatively high throughout the period, consistent with the city's coastal climate, which can lead to a persistent feeling of dampness and may have implications for local fog formation. Air pressure showed some fluctuation, indicating the possibility of changing weather patterns, including the potential for incoming fronts which could alter temperatures and precipitation levels. Wind speeds were mostly light, suggesting a calm weather period, although there was a slight increase later in the period, which coupled with shifting wind directions could signal a change in weather systems affecting the area. The varying wind directions throughout the day, shifting from primarily southwest to more northerly and westerly, may reflect the passage of a weather front through the San Francisco area.
