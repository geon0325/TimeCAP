Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a gradual increase in temperature, transitioning from cooler to warmer conditions as the day progressed. Humidity levels fluctuated moderately but showed a significant increase in the last few hours, indicating potential for a more muggy environment which could lead to discomfort or increase the likelihood of precipitation. Air pressure experienced a slight but steady decrease throughout the period, suggesting that a change in weather patterns could be approaching, possibly leading to unsettled weather. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate and increased slightly as the day progressed, which might contribute to a wind chill effect, particularly during the cooler morning hours. The wind direction shifted more easterly to southeasterly, which in Houston is often associated with bringing in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, possibly hinting at an increased chance of rain or thunderstorms in the near future.
