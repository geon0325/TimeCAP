Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before slightly decreasing towards the evening. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuation, with a spike to saturation in the early morning, followed by a decrease during the day, and a rise again towards the night, indicating the possibility of morning and late evening fog or mist. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a minor variation, suggesting steady weather conditions. Wind speeds varied moderately, with periods of calmer winds interspersed with occasional gusts, while wind direction shifted primarily between south and southeast, indicating the potential for warm, moist air inflow from the Gulf of Mexico. These conditions, combined with high humidity and increasing temperatures, could lead to the development of localized thunderstorms or showers.
