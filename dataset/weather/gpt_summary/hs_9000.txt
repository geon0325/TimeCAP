Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature, with a peak during the afternoon hours, followed by a significant drop towards the evening, which is typical of the diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels have been high, indicating a lot of moisture in the air, which could lead to a feeling of mugginess and potentially contribute to the development of fog or precipitation, especially when they peaked towards nighttime. Air pressure experienced a substantial increase in the middle of the day, which often signifies more stable weather conditions, but the overall variation suggests the presence of varying weather systems passing through the area. Wind speeds have remained relatively light and variable, which might not contribute significantly to dispersing the atmospheric moisture. The wind direction has shown a general preference for southerly to southeasterly winds, which in Houston, could bring warmer, moister air from the Gulf of Mexico, influencing both temperature and humidity levels.
