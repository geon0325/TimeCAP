Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a fluctuating but overall increasing trend in the mortality rate from influenza and pneumonia compared to total deaths, with the ratio peaking at 18.51% in week 18, significantly higher than the average ratio of 7.84%. The absolute number of deaths from these respiratory diseases rose from the beginning of the period, with pneumonia deaths increasing substantially from 12,325 to a peak of 16,037 in week 18, before a decline to 13,527 in week 20. Notably, there was a sharp increase in influenza deaths in the last two weeks of the data, with deaths rising from an average of around 25 per week to 187 and then 141, which may indicate a sudden outbreak. This uptick contrasts with a general decline in total deaths moving from week 18 to week 20, suggesting that influenza may be an emerging concern despite a potential decrease in overall mortality. The observed trends suggest a seasonal increase in respiratory diseases, likely burdening the healthcare system, and necessitate close monitoring and possibly increased healthcare resources dedicated to respiratory disease management and prevention.
