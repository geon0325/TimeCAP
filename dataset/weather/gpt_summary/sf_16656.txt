Over the last 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have shown a mild fluctuation, starting and ending on a relatively warmer note with a noticeable dip during the early hours. Humidity levels were consistently high, reaching saturation at one point, which suggests the possibility of fog, especially during the early hours when combined with lower temperatures. Air pressure remained fairly stable with a slight increasing trend, indicative of settled weather conditions likely without any significant storm systems approaching.
