Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a slight increase in temperatures, reaching a peak during the latter part of the day before starting to decline again. Humidity levels remained relatively high for most of the day, although there was some variability, with noticeable drops and increases that could affect comfort levels outdoors. Air pressure showed a gradual decreasing trend, which might indicate the approach of a weather system that could lead to changes in the current weather conditions. Wind speed varied, with some hours experiencing calm conditions and others having moderate gusts, peaking during the middle of the day, which could influence wind chill and make it feel cooler than the actual temperature. Wind direction was predominantly from the east to the northeast, with some variability, potentially bringing cooler air from the ocean over the city.
