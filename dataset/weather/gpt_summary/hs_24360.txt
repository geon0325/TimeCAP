In the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the latter part of the day before slightly decreasing towards the end of the period. Humidity levels were highly variable; they were at their highest during the early morning hours, indicative of potentially muggy conditions, and then decreased significantly as temperatures rose, suggesting more comfortable conditions later in the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day with a slight fluctuation, which is typical for stable weather patterns in the region. Wind speeds varied mildly, with a noticeable increase around midday, which could have contributed to a temporary relief from the heat and humidity. Lastly, wind direction was predominantly from the south to the southwest, which is common for Houston and can bring in both moisture and warmer air from the Gulf of Mexico.
