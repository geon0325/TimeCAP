Over the last 20 weeks, the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia to total deaths has fluctuated, with an average of 5.56%, which is below the historical average of 7.84%. While the total number of deaths has remained relatively stable, peaking at 57192 in week 17, the deaths attributable to Influenza or Pneumonia have shown a slight upward trend in the latter part of the 20-week period. Notably, deaths from pneumonia have consistently outweighed those from influenza, with pneumonia deaths peaking at 3436 in the final week. The mortality ratio from these conditions has increased from 5.75% in the first week to 6.07% in the last week, indicating a recent uptick in their impact on overall mortality. This trend warrants close monitoring as it may signal a need for increased healthcare resources and preventative measures to address respiratory illnesses.
