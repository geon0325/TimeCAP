Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a slight decrease in temperature, indicating a modest cooling trend. Humidity levels have remained high throughout the period, reaching saturation at several points, which could be indicative of foggy conditions or the potential for precipitation. Atmospheric pressure has been relatively stable with a slight increase towards the end of the period, suggesting stable weather conditions may prevail. There has been a noticeable increase in wind speed in the latter hours, with the wind direction shifting predominantly from the south-southwest to a more northerly direction. This change in wind dynamics, coupled with high humidity and stable pressure, may lead to cooler and potentially damp weather conditions in the near term.
