Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a decrease in temperature during the night, followed by a significant warming trend throughout the day, which is typical for this coastal city due to the influence of maritime air. Relative humidity levels remained high and relatively stable, which may have contributed to a perception of cooler temperatures during the cooler hours and a muggy feeling during the warmest periods. Atmospheric pressure showed minor fluctuations but remained mostly steady, indicating a stable weather pattern without the immediate approach of any significant weather fronts. Wind speeds were generally low, suggesting a calm weather period with limited wind chill effect and reduced dispersion of urban pollutants. The wind direction varied but predominantly came from the southern quadrant, which is common in San Francisco, often bringing in moisture from the ocean and affecting local microclimates.
