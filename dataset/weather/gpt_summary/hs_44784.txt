Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have shown a general increasing trend, starting cooler in the early hours and reaching their peak in the late afternoon before descending slightly towards the evening. Humidity levels have fluctuated, with a notable increase in the evening which could indicate a feeling of mugginess or potential for condensation and fog development overnight. Air pressure has been relatively stable, although there was a slight decrease later in the day, which could suggest a change in weather patterns, possibly leading to increased cloudiness or wind changes. Wind speeds remained mostly light to gentle and increased towards the end of the period, which may disperse humidity and influence the thermal comfort. Wind direction varied significantly throughout the day, with a tendency towards easterly directions, which could have implications for local weather conditions, such as bringing moisture from the Gulf of Mexico.
