Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a slight decrease in temperature, indicating a cooling trend. Humidity levels saw significant fluctuations, with a notable spike during the cooler early morning hours before dropping considerably as temperatures rose modestly by the afternoon. Air pressure remained relatively stable for most of the day, with a significant increase toward the end of the period, which could suggest the approach of a high-pressure system, potentially leading to clearer skies. Wind speeds varied, with periods of calm and gusts reaching moderate levels, and the overall direction shifted from westerly to northwesterly, which is consistent with the passage of a frontal system. The combination of increasing air pressure and changing wind direction may point to an incoming period of fair weather for the city.
