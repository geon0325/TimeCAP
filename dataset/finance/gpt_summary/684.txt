Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown moderate volatility with an upward trend, closing higher by approximately 2.6% from the starting point, which suggests a growing investor confidence. The VIX, or Volatility Index, has decreased from 25.71 to 16.30, indicating a reduction in market uncertainty and enhanced investor sentiment. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 indices have both experienced recoveries, rising by approximately 4.4% and 4.8% respectively, which could reflect improved economic outlooks in Japan and the UK. Gold futures have seen some fluctuation but ended with a 0.3% decline, suggesting that investors may be favoring riskier assets over traditional safe havens. Crude Oil futures have risen by almost 17%, which might contribute to inflationary pressures, while the forex data shows a stable EUR/USD exchange rate and a slight appreciation of the USD against the JPY and CNY, hinting at a strengthening US dollar.
