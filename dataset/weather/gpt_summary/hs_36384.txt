Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have demonstrated a typical diurnal variation with a gradual increase through the daytime hours, followed by a decrease during the night, maintaining values within a comfortable range. Humidity levels were notably high, especially during the early morning hours when they reached saturation, indicating the presence of fog or dew, but decreased as temperatures rose, which is common due to the inverse relationship between temperature and relative humidity. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight increase in the middle of the period, suggesting stable weather conditions with no significant front changes or storm systems affecting the area. Wind speeds were mostly light to gentle and showed no significant gusts that would indicate turbulent weather conditions. The wind direction varied but primarily stayed within the north to northeast quadrant, which is typical for the region during periods of stable weather.
