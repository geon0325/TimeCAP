The data indicates a consistent decline in the number of patients presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI) over the last 20 weeks, with the ratio of ILI patients remaining well below the baseline of 2.9% throughout the period. The age group 0-4 consistently reported the highest number of ILI cases compared to other age groups, which may suggest higher transmission rates or a greater susceptibility in this demographic. While the overall number of patients decreased significantly mid-way through the period, there was a subsequent slight uptick in patient numbers, which did not, however, result in a proportionate increase in ILI cases. The ILI ratio showed a very slight increase towards the end of the period, although it remained below the threshold for heightened concern. This trend suggests that while ILI is not currently a significant burden on the healthcare system, continued monitoring is essential, particularly for the youngest age group, to detect any potential changes in the trend.
