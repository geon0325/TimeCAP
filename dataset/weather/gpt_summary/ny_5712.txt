Over the past 24 hours in New York City, there has been a gradual increase in temperature, with the warmest conditions recorded in the late afternoon and early evening. Humidity levels have seen significant fluctuations, starting high in the early hours, decreasing sharply mid-morning, and then maintaining lower levels for the remainder of the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight decrease towards the evening, suggesting stable weather conditions but with a potential for minor changes. Wind speeds varied, with some calm periods and occasional gusts, and while the wind direction shifted throughout the day, there was a general trend of westerly to southwesterly winds. The combination of rising temperatures, variable humidity, and steady pressure, along with the changing wind patterns, indicates a typical transitional weather pattern without any immediate signs of severe weather events.
