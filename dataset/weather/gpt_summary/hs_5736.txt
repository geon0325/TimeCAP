Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has shown a cyclical pattern typical of diurnal variation, with a peak during the afternoon hours and a gradual decrease through the night to early morning. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, reaching full saturation in the early morning, which suggests the possibility of fog or dew formation, and then decreasing during the day, indicative of drier conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight variation, which is generally associated with stable weather patterns. Wind speeds varied moderately and were strongest towards the end of the period, which could contribute to changes in temperature and humidity by mixing the air. The wind direction was predominantly from the southeast, which in Houston could mean the advection of moist air from the Gulf of Mexico, potentially leading to increased humidity and cloud cover.
