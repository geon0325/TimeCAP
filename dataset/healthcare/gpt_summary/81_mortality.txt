Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a gradual increase in the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, starting at 5.39% and rising to 6.56%, with the average ratio for the period being below the historical average of 7.84%. The total number of deaths fluctuated modestly but showed an upward trend, starting at 50,274 and ending at 55,595. Despite fluctuations, the absolute number of deaths from pneumonia showed an overall increase from 2,700 to 3,528, while deaths from influenza spiked dramatically in the last few weeks, rising from single digits to 118. This trend suggests a heightened impact of respiratory infections on mortality, which could indicate either an increase in the virulence or prevalence of these infections, or a change in the demographic or health status of the population. Healthcare systems may need to consider bolstering resources to manage potential surges in respiratory illnesses and investigate underlying causes for the noted increases in mortality ratios.
