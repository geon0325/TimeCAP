Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable downward trend in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a peak ratio of 9.89% in week 4 decreasing to 0.49% by week 20. Influenza A has been the predominant strain, with its highest ratio of positive specimens at 9.85% in week 4, but it has since dropped to 0.44% in week 20, indicating a significant decline in prevalence. The impact of Influenza B has been minimal throughout the period, maintaining a ratio well below 1%. This overall decline in influenza positivity rates suggests a decrease in influenza activity and may potentially indicate the end of the influenza season. However, healthcare systems should remain vigilant for potential upticks and continue promoting influenza vaccination and surveillance, as fluctuations in viral activity are common.
