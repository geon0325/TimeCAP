San Francisco has experienced a notable fluctuation in temperature over the past 24 hours, with a warming trend observed during the daytime and a cooling trend during the early morning and late evening hours. Humidity levels have varied significantly, showing high levels during the night and early morning hours, which decreased sharply during the day, possibly indicating the presence of morning fog that burned off as temperatures rose. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight increase observed midday, which could be associated with the transient high-pressure conditions that are typical for the region. Wind speeds have been mostly light to moderate, with a peak during the evening, suggesting the influence of sea breezes that are common in coastal areas. The wind direction has been variable, although predominantly westerly, which is consistent with the prevailing winds coming off the Pacific Ocean that affect San Francisco's weather.
