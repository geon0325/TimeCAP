Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced relatively stable temperatures, with a slight warming trend observed during the latter part of the day. Humidity levels have fluctuated significantly, alternating between very high and slightly lower percentages, suggesting the presence of moisture that could lead to foggy conditions or precipitation. Air pressure has been gradually decreasing, which is indicative of an approaching weather system that could potentially bring unsettled weather. Wind speeds have been moderate with occasional higher gusts, while the wind direction has been predominantly northerly with some variability, which could influence the transport of cooler air into the region. The combination of these factors suggests that there is potential for changing weather conditions in Houston, possibly leading to rain or storms in the near future.
