Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, indicating a warming trend. Humidity levels remained relatively high throughout the period, suggesting a significant amount of moisture in the air, which could contribute to a feeling of mugginess or potential for fog development, especially during the early morning or nighttime hours. Air pressure showed a slight decreasing trend, which might signal a change in the weather pattern or the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds were mostly consistent and moderate, suggesting steady weather conditions without significant gusts or lulls. The wind direction was predominantly from the south-southeast, which is typical for this region and can contribute to the transport of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico into the area, influencing both temperature and humidity levels.
