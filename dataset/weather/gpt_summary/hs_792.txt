Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have shown a typical diurnal pattern, starting off warm, gradually cooling overnight, and then increasing again during the day, reaching their peak in the late afternoon. Humidity levels were high throughout the period, with a noticeable drop during the warmest part of the day, but surged back in the cooler evening hours, indicating a muggy atmosphere that can make conditions feel warmer than actual temperatures suggest. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with only minor fluctuations, which is indicative of steady weather conditions and no immediate signs of significant weather systems developing. Wind speeds were generally light, with a period of calm winds, and no strong gusts observed, which would have limited dispersion of pollutants and may have led to a sense of stillness in the air. Wind direction varied, but a notable shift occurred from predominantly southerly to a westerly direction, which can sometimes bring changes in weather patterns, including possible variations in temperature and humidity.
