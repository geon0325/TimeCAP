Over the last 24 hours in Houston, the temperature exhibited a diurnal pattern with a peak during the day and a gradual decrease overnight, consistent with typical daily temperature cycles. Humidity levels showed significant variation, with lower values during the day, which then increased markedly overnight, reaching saturation at certain points, indicative of potential fog or dew formation. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight declining trend, suggesting a stable weather pattern without significant frontal activity. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with some increase observed in the latter part of the period, which could contribute to minor wind-chill effects and the dispersal of any humidity-related fog or mist. The wind generally blew from a southerly direction, shifting occasionally, which is typical for Houston and may influence the transportation of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico into the area.
