Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature with a general trend of cooling during the early hours, which gradually increased towards the afternoon, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels were consistently high, often reaching saturation, suggesting a likelihood of fog or mist formation, particularly during times of lower temperatures. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable and high throughout the period, which is usually associated with settled weather conditions and a lower chance of precipitation. Wind speeds were mostly light and showed little variation, indicating a calm weather pattern with limited wind-related impacts. The wind direction was predominantly from the south-southeast, which is typical for Houston and may contribute to the warm, moist air coming from the Gulf of Mexico, affecting local humidity and temperature.
