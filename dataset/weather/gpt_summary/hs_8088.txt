Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual rise in temperature, reaching its peak in the latter part of the day, indicative of a typical diurnal warming pattern. However, humidity levels have shown a decreasing trend throughout the day, which is likely contributing to a sensation of more comfortable weather conditions despite the increasing temperatures. Air pressure started relatively high but has been on a subtle downward trend, suggesting the possibility of changing weather patterns or the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds remained consistently low, which would have done little to provide relief from the heat or to disperse atmospheric pollutants, potentially affecting air quality. The wind direction varied significantly, with a notable shift from primarily easterly winds to westerly and then back to easterly, which could be related to local weather systems affecting the area.
