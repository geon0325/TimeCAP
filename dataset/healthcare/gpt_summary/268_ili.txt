The Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data over the last 20 weeks indicates a decreasing trend in the percentage of ILI patients, with the ratio consistently dropping from well above the baseline to below it. Early weeks showed significantly higher ratios, suggesting a more severe ILI prevalence that has since subsided to ratios well below the baseline, indicating a decreasing burden on the healthcare system. Most notably, the highest ratios were observed in the youngest (0-4 years) and older age groups (50-64, and 65 or more), which are typically at greater risk for complications from ILI. In recent weeks, the percentage of ILI patients has slightly increased but remains below the baseline, suggesting a potential mild uptick in ILI cases. Despite the overall decline, healthcare providers should remain vigilant, especially for vulnerable age groups, and continue to monitor for any signs of increased ILI activity that could signify the onset of a new wave of infections.
