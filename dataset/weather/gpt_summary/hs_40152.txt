Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before gradually cooling down to a stable level throughout the night and early morning. Relative humidity levels have varied inversely with temperature, showing higher humidity during the cooler early hours and decreasing as temperatures rose, which is typical for Houston's climate. The air pressure has remained relatively stable with only minor fluctuations, indicating no significant weather fronts moving through the area during this time. Wind speeds have been mostly light to moderate, with some increase during the day, which could have contributed to the dispersal of humidity and provided some relief from the heat. Wind direction has been variable, predominantly coming from the south to southeast, which is common for Houston and can bring warmer air from the Gulf of Mexico.
