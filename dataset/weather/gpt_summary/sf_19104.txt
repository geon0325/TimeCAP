Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have experienced a slight fluctuation but remained relatively stable overall, exhibiting a modest cooling trend followed by a gradual warming. Humidity levels have been consistently high, reaching saturation at several points throughout the period, which could indicate the presence of fog or mist, particularly during the nighttime and early morning hours. Atmospheric pressure has been slightly decreasing yet remains on the higher side, suggesting stable weather conditions but possibly leading to a change in weather patterns if the trend continues.
