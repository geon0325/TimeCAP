Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a general upward trend, increasing from 3369.16 to 3662.45, indicating a bullish sentiment in the U.S. equity markets. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, has gradually decreased from 35.55 to 20.77, reflecting increased investor confidence and reduced market uncertainty. International equity indices such as the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 have also experienced overall gains, with the Nikkei notably rising from 23295.48 to 26787.54, suggesting a positive outlook in global stock markets. Gold futures have seen volatility with a significant drop to 1775.70 before recovering to 1814.10, which could indicate a shift in safe-haven asset preferences amid a more risk-on market environment. Crude oil futures have risen from 37.66 to 44.55, and major currency pairs such as EUR/USD and USD/JPY have remained relatively stable, suggesting that the foreign exchange market is not expecting major economic shifts, while a slight appreciation of the USD against the CNY from 6.69 to 6.58 could signify improving U.S.-China trade relations or a stronger U.S. dollar.
