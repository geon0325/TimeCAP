Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable diurnal temperature variation with a discernible increase during the day followed by a cooling trend towards the night. Humidity levels saw significant fluctuations, reaching saturation at one point, which may have led to fog or mist formation, particularly during the cooler early morning or late evening hours. The air pressure showed variability, with a tendency towards higher values, which could suggest the influence of a high-pressure system at certain times. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a peak that could have contributed to a temporary drop in humidity and a shift in air pressure. The wind direction varied considerably, indicating the passage of different air masses and the potential for changing weather patterns, including the possibility of coastal breezes impacting local conditions.
