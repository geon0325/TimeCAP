The analysis of the 20-week time-series data for Influenza-like Illness (ILI) reveals a gradual increase in the ratio of ILI patients, which has recently crossed the baseline threshold indicative of a heightened influenza situation. Early weeks showed ratios well below the baseline, but there has been a notable uptrend, with recent weeks consistently exceeding the baseline, suggesting an ongoing or intensifying ILI season. The age group of 5-24 has experienced a significant surge in ILI cases, which may be attributed to high levels of social interaction and could potentially impact school attendance and productivity. Additionally, an upward trend in ILI cases among the age groups of 25-49 and 50-64 indicates that the illness is affecting a wider adult population, which may lead to increased workplace absenteeism and a higher demand for healthcare services. The consistent increase in ILI cases among the elderly (age 65 or more), a group typically at higher risk for complications, underscores the need for vigilant clinical monitoring and possibly enhanced influenza vaccination efforts in this demographic.
