Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature reaching a peak before slightly dropping, indicative of typical diurnal variation coupled with a possible warm front passage. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with a period of complete saturation suggesting the presence of dense fog or heavy precipitation, followed by a sharp decrease which could denote the passage of the front and subsequent clearing of the skies. Air pressure remained relatively stable, indicating a lack of strong weather systems moving through the area. Wind speeds varied, with a notable increase later in the period, which, along with a shift in wind direction from southerly to northwesterly, suggests the arrival of a frontal system that could lead to cooler and clearer conditions. The combination of these indicators points towards a weather front that passed through the city, likely bringing a transient period of unsettled weather followed by clearer skies and a potential drop in temperature.
