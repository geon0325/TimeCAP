Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown moderate volatility with an upward trend, peaking on the 16th market day at 2803.69 before declining to 2748.93, suggesting a possible correction or consolidation phase. The VIX, which is inversely related to market sentiment, mirrors this with a decrease in volatility mid-period before rising towards the end of the period, indicating growing investor uncertainty. The Nikkei 225 displayed growth with a slight pullback, while the FTSE 100 moved with less volatility but ended the period slightly lower than its starting point, reflecting mixed sentiments in the global equity markets. Gold futures experienced a downward trend after reaching a peak on the 8th market day, which could be indicative of investors shifting towards higher-risk assets during parts of the period, although the slight rise at the end could suggest a return to safe-haven investments. The exchange rates for EUR/USD and USD/CNY remained relatively stable, suggesting a steady currency market, while the USD/JPY appreciated over the period, pointing to a strengthening of the US dollar against the Japanese yen.
