Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable decline in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a drop from 12.74% to 1.43% in the overall positivity ratio. The decline is observed for both Influenza A and B, with Influenza A positivity rates decreasing from 3.61% to 0.98% and Influenza B from 9.13% to 0.45%. The highest number of specimens tested was at the beginning of the time series, with a gradual decrease observed over the period, potentially reflecting a seasonal reduction in respiratory illnesses or a decrease in testing. Despite the declining trend, the average ratio of positive specimens over the period (6.26%) indicates that influenza is still present in the population at a level above the latest observed ratios. This trend suggests a potential easing of the burden on healthcare resources related to influenza; however, continued surveillance is crucial to monitor for possible future outbreaks or seasonal variations.
