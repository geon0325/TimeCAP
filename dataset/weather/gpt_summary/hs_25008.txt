Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a notable fluctuation in temperature with a warming trend observed during the daytime and a slight cooling trend during the night. Humidity levels experienced a significant variation, reaching saturation at certain points, which could have led to the formation of fog or mist, particularly when coinciding with cooler temperatures. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting a period without significant weather fronts passing through the area. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with occasional shifts in direction, indicating variable wind patterns without a dominant weather system. The combination of high temperatures, varying humidity, and stable pressure could suggest a likelihood of muggy conditions, with the potential for localized weather events driven by diurnal heating.
