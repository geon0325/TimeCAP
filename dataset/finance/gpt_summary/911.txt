Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with an initial dip, recovery, and subsequent fluctuations, ending in a slight uptrend from 4297.14 to 4110.41. The VIX, or Volatility Index, mirrored this uncertainty, with a general increase from 19.95 to 23.87, suggesting heightened market volatility and investor anxiety. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 also experienced fluctuations, with the Nikkei 225 recovering from a low mid-period and the FTSE 100 showing a notable drop followed by a rebound towards the period's end. Gold Futures and Crude Oil Futures both dipped mid-period but rose towards the end, indicating a possible increase in safe-haven and energy asset demand. Exchange rates saw the EUR/USD fluctuating narrowly around parity, while the USD/JPY and USD/CNY experienced a gradual strengthening of the USD, potentially reflecting a flight to the perceived safety of the dollar amidst market uncertainties.
