Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have exhibited a typical diurnal pattern, decreasing overnight to reach a minimum in the early hours, followed by a steady increase throughout the day. Humidity levels started relatively high and remained fairly constant during the night and early morning, but experienced a marked decrease as temperatures peaked, suggesting an inverse relationship between temperature and humidity during this period. Air pressure has been relatively stable, showing a slight overall increase, which could be indicative of settled weather conditions persisting in the area. Wind speeds began higher and gradually decreased towards the middle of the timeframe, with a slight increase observed later, while maintaining predominantly northerly directions with some variability, which could influence local wind chill and maritime conditions. The consistency in wind direction from the north to northwest is typical for San Francisco, and it could potentially contribute to the upwelling of colder waters along the coast, affecting both marine and weather patterns in the region.
