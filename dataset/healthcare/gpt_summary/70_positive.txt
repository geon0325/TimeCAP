The time-series data indicates a substantial decrease in both the number of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza and the ratios of positive specimens over the last 20 weeks. The peak of positive specimens occurred at the beginning of the time series with ratios consistently above the 20-week average of 6.26%, reaching as high as 24.73% in week 3, before following a downward trend to as low as 2.65% in the final week. Influenza A showed a more pronounced decline than Influenza B, with its peak positive specimen ratio at 20.21% and ending at 1.27%, suggesting that Influenza A was driving the earlier peak in cases. Despite a relatively higher ratio of positive specimens for Influenza B in the later weeks, it too has shown a decline, with the ratio dropping from 6.23% to 1.38% over the period. This decline in influenza activity may lead to a reduction in the strain on healthcare resources; however, continued surveillance is essential to monitor for potential resurgences or new strains.
