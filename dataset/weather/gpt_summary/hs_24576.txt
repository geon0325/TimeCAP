Over the last 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has shown a noticeable upward trend, peaking during the later hours of the day, which is typical for this region. Humidity levels varied significantly, with a sharp drop midday, indicating a potential for discomfort during these hours, followed by a rise towards the evening, suggestive of a more muggy night. The air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, maintaining conditions typical for settled weather. Wind speeds fluctuated moderately, with calmer winds around midday and stronger gusts later on, which could influence the dispersion of any airborne particles and affect local air quality. The prevailing wind direction was primarily from the south, which is often associated with warmer air masses moving into the area, contributing to the increase in temperature observed.
