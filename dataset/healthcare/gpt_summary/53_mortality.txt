Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a general downward trend in the ratio of mortality due to Influenza or Pneumonia compared to total deaths, starting at 10.55% and ending at 5.85%, indicating a relative decrease in the impact of these respiratory diseases on overall mortality. The total number of deaths from all causes has fluctuated but shows a slight decrease from 67,495 to 50,929 over this period. Deaths attributed to Influenza have significantly decreased from 1,536 to just 26, while Pneumonia-related deaths have also declined from 5,583 to 2,951. Despite these reductions, the mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia remains above the average ratio of 7.84%, except for the last five weeks, where it dipped below this benchmark. This data suggests a potential easing of the burden on healthcare systems from these illnesses but also emphasizes the need for continued vigilance and healthcare resource planning.
