Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have exhibited a gradual decrease reaching a minimum before dawn, and subsequently a slight increase as the day progressed, indicative of a typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels fluctuated, increasing during the cooler early morning hours and decreasing in the afternoon, which is consistent with the inverse relationship between temperature and relative humidity. Air pressure showed an overall rising trend, suggesting the strengthening of a high-pressure system which could lead to stable and clear weather conditions. Wind speeds remained predominantly light, with a couple of brief periods of higher speeds; however, the wind direction was variable with occasional shifts, indicating that the local wind patterns were not dominated by any consistent weather system. Overall, the combination of rising air pressure, light wind, and stable humidity levels points towards calm and settled weather for Houston in the near term.
