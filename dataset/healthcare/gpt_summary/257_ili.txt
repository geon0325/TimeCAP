The analysis of the 20-week time-series data on Influenza-like Illness (ILI) reveals a fluctuating but overall declining trend in the percentage of ILI patients, with early weeks showing higher ratios that exceed the baseline threshold, indicating a more severe ILI activity which has gradually subsided to below baseline levels in recent weeks. The age group data indicates that the highest number of ILI cases were consistently reported in the 5-24 age group, suggesting a higher transmission or susceptibility in this demographic, whereas the oldest age group (65 or more) consistently reported the fewest cases, potentially due to higher vaccination rates or reduced exposure. The decrease in the total number of patients and ILI cases across all age groups in the latter weeks could indicate a waning of the ILI season or the effectiveness of public health interventions. However, the healthcare system should remain vigilant as the overall decline does not rule out the possibility of localized outbreaks or a resurgence. The data highlights the importance of continued monitoring of ILI trends and maintaining preventive measures, particularly in the most affected age groups, to manage healthcare resources effectively.
