Over the past 24 hours in New York City, temperatures experienced a significant rise during the daytime, reaching what would be considered summer-like conditions, before slightly cooling towards the evening. Humidity levels started high during the early hours, indicative of a muggy morning, but decreased as temperatures peaked, suggesting a drier atmosphere during the hottest part of the day. Air pressure showed a gentle declining trend throughout the period, which could be associated with the approach of a low-pressure system, potentially leading to changing weather conditions. Wind speeds remained generally light, with a slight increase observed during the time of peak temperatures, which could have provided a small measure of relief from the heat. The wind direction shifted from southeasterly to southwesterly, which is often associated with the movement of warmer air masses in the region, corroborating the observed increase in temperature.
