Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a notable fluctuation in temperature, with a general cooling trend that eventually gave way to a warming pattern towards the most recent hours. Humidity levels were persistently high, reaching saturation at times, which could have led to foggy conditions, particularly when coupled with the relatively low temperatures observed. Air pressure showed both a significant increase and a sharp decrease within the period, indicating the possible passage of a frontal system through the area. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with a period of increased wind activity, which may have influenced the dispersal of any fog or low-level cloud cover. The wind direction varied widely throughout the day, suggesting a changeable weather pattern and the potential for variable weather conditions to continue.
