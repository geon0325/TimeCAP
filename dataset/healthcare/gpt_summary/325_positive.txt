Over the past 20 weeks, there has been an observable increase in the ratio of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a peak ratio of 9.89% in week 15, which is substantially higher than the 20-week average of 6.26%. The majority of positive cases were attributed to Influenza A, which showed a similar trend with a peak at 9.85% in the same week, while Influenza B remained relatively low, never exceeding 0.17%. The number of specimens tested has fluctuated, with an initial decrease from week 1 to week 5, followed by variable testing rates that trended upwards in the more recent weeks. Despite the overall increase in positive cases, the latest data from week 20 indicates a slight decrease in the positivity ratio for both Influenza A and B to 7.20% and 0.07%, respectively. Given these trends, healthcare systems should prepare for potential surges in influenza cases, ensuring adequate supplies and resources are available for testing, vaccination, and treatment.
