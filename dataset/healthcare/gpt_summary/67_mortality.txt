Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia to the total number of deaths has trended below the average of 7.84%, starting at 6.63% and ending at 5.21%. This decline indicates a reduction in deaths from these causes compared to the total mortality. The total number of deaths fluctuated slightly but remained above 50,000, peaking at 54,038 in the first week. Deaths specifically from influenza showed a significant decrease, starting at 153 in week one and dropping to single digits midway through the period, ending at 6 in the last week. Pneumonia-related deaths also decreased over the 20 weeks, from 3,430 to 2,630, which may suggest improvements in prevention, management, or treatment of these respiratory conditions.
