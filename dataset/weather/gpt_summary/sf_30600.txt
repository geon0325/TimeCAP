In San Francisco over the past 24 hours, temperatures exhibited a cooling trend overnight before warming up during the day, a pattern typical of the coastal climate influenced by oceanic currents. Relative humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with particularly high values during the early morning hours indicating the possibility of fog or dew, which is common for the region due to its proximity to the water. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a minor dip, suggesting stable weather conditions without the immediate likelihood of significant weather disturbances. Wind speeds increased towards the latter part of the day, which could have contributed to a decrease in humidity as drier air was potentially brought in from inland areas. The wind direction was variable but predominantly came from the south to the west, which is consistent with the passage of a weather front or the presence of sea breezes in the afternoon.
