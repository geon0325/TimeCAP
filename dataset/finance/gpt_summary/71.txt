Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with an overall downward trend, ending 3.2% lower than its starting point which could signal growing investor caution or a potential market correction. The VIX, commonly known as the "fear index," has increased by approximately 66.7% from its initial value, peaking at the end of the period, indicating heightened market volatility and investor uncertainty. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have both declined by 4.4% and 3.7% respectively, suggesting a global risk-off sentiment. Gold Futures have risen by approximately 1% reflecting its status as a safe-haven asset amid market turbulence, while Crude Oil Futures have experienced slight depreciation indicating potential concerns over global economic growth. Currency exchange rates have remained relatively stable, with minor depreciation in the EUR/USD and USD/JPY pairs, and a slight appreciation of the USD against the CNY, which could point to a slight strengthening of the dollar in the face of market volatility.
