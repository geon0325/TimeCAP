Over the last 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature with a peak during the day followed by a gradual cooling trend towards the evening and night. Humidity levels experienced significant variation, with very high levels occurring concurrently with lower temperatures, indicative of possible early morning fog or mist, and a stark decrease in humidity later in the day, which could suggest drier conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations that are not indicative of any major weather events. Wind speeds were mostly light but picked up significantly towards the latter part of the period, which could have resulted in cooler perceived temperatures and might have influenced any fog dispersal. Wind direction varied widely throughout the period, suggesting changing weather patterns and potentially uneven weather conditions across different parts of the city.
