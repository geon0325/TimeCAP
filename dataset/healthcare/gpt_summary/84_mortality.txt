Over the last 20 weeks, there has been an upward trend in the mortality ratio of deaths due to Influenza or Pneumonia compared to total deaths, rising from 5.21% to 8.33%, which is above the average ratio of 7.84%. The number of deaths from Influenza has increased significantly in the last three weeks, with a notable jump from 118 to 671 deaths, while Pneumonia-related deaths also rose steadily, culminating in 4418 deaths in the final week. The total number of deaths has escalated in the last five weeks, with an increase from 54760 to 61090, indicating an overall rise in mortality. This pattern suggests a potential stress on healthcare resources due to the increasing burden of respiratory infections. The sharp rise in Influenza-related mortality in recent weeks may indicate an emerging public health concern that requires immediate attention to prevent further escalation.
