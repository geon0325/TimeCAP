Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has fluctuated slightly, with a general pattern of cooling overnight and warming during the day, typical of the diurnal cycle. Humidity levels have varied, showing an increase during the early morning hours, which is common due to the decrease in temperature and stabilization of the atmosphere at night. Air pressure has remained relatively stable, indicating no significant weather systems moving through the area that would typically cause marked changes in pressure. Wind speeds have been consistent, with a slight increase observed in the later hours, and the predominant wind direction has been from the south to the south-southeast, which may contribute to the transport of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico into the region.
