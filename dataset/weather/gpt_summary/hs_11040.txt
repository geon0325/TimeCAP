Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, with a notable drop as the period progressed, indicating a transition to cooler conditions. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking at very high percentages before decreasing sharply, suggesting possible variations in comfort levels or the presence of weather fronts. Air pressure showed an overall increasing trend throughout the period, which is often associated with the onset of more stable weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally light, with minimal variation, which could lead to the slow dispersion of any airborne particulates or pollutants. The wind direction was variable at times but showed repeated shifts to a northerly component, which might be related to the observed cooling trend and pressure changes.
