Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a decreasing trend in the number of patients presenting with Influenza-like Illness (ILI), moving from well above the baseline to values approaching, but still above, the threshold. The highest ratios of ILI were observed at the beginning of the time series, with a subsequent decline that suggests a tapering of ILI activity across all age groups. Notably, the youngest age group (0-4 years) consistently showed the highest count of ILI cases, which could indicate higher susceptibility or transmission rates within this demographic. Despite the overall decrease, there has been a slight uptick in ILI ratios in recent weeks, warranting attention to prevent a potential resurgence. Healthcare systems should remain vigilant, ensuring adequate resources are available for the youngest patients, while monitoring for signs of increasing ILI activity across all age groups.
