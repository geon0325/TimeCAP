Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable decline in the proportion of deaths attributed to influenza and pneumonia, dropping from a high of 14.49% to 6.08% in the most recent week. This trend correlates with a decrease in the total number of deaths reported weekly, starting at 77,139 and falling to 58,240. However, the absolute number of deaths from pneumonia has not decreased as sharply as the total deaths, indicating pneumonia remains a significant concern. Deaths from influenza have fluctuated without a clear trend, but notably dropped to 35 in the last week from an earlier peak of 106. Despite these variations, the average mortality ratio over the 20 weeks (7.84%) remains above the most recent reported ratio (6.08%), suggesting a potential improvement in the control or treatment of these illnesses but continued vigilance is required.
