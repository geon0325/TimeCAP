Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable warming trend with temperatures peaking in the late afternoon before gradually declining towards the evening. The relative humidity followed an inverse pattern, starting high in the early morning hours, decreasing as temperatures rose, and then increasing again as the sun set. Atmospheric pressure has shown a slight but steady decrease throughout the period, suggesting a potential change in weather conditions may be approaching. Wind speeds remained moderate and consistent, with gentle to moderate breezes, while the wind direction was predominantly from the south to southeast, which is typical for this region and can contribute to the warm, moist air. Overall, the weather has been relatively stable, but the decrease in pressure could indicate that a weather system might be moving into the area.
