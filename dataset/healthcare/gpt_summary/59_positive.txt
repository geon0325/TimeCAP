Over the past 20 weeks, respiratory specimen testing has shown a general increase in the prevalence of Influenza A and B, with a peak ratio of positive specimens at 24.73% in week 14, which is significantly higher than the 20-week average of 6.26%. The proportion of positive tests for Influenza A rose sharply from 2.44% to a high of 20.21% by week 12, before declining to 5.03% by week 20, indicating a possible tapering off of this strain. In contrast, Influenza B showed a slower but consistent increase, reaching a peak ratio of 11.26% in week 19, suggesting a delayed seasonality or a second wave for this strain. The overall decline in positive specimens to 15.43% by week 20 may signal a downward trend in influenza activity, yet the high percentage of positive tests for Influenza B remains a concern. These trends underscore the need for continued influenza surveillance and vaccination efforts, especially for vulnerable populations, to manage the burden on healthcare systems.
