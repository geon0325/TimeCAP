Over the last 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has seen a gradual increase from cooler early morning hours to a significantly warmer afternoon, before slightly declining again towards the evening. Humidity levels started relatively high and peaked at full saturation during the early hours, indicating the possibility of fog or dew, but gradually decreased as temperatures rose, suggesting clearer conditions later in the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with a slight increase midday, which could be associated with fair weather conditions. Wind speeds were mostly light and variable, with very little fluctuation, indicating a calm weather pattern without significant wind-related events. The wind direction was predominantly from the east to southeast, which is typical for Houston's weather, and could be associated with the transport of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, potentially contributing to the high humidity levels observed.
