Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has experienced a downward trend, declining from 4796.56 to 4515.55, reflecting increased market uncertainty and potential investor caution. Concurrently, the VIX, which measures market volatility, showed heightened variability and a general increase, peaking at 31.96 before settling at 24.83, indicating a period of heightened market stress. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 indices also witnessed volatility, with the Nikkei undergoing a significant drop mid-period and the FTSE 100 showing relative stability with slight fluctuations. Commodity prices such as Gold Futures and Crude Oil Futures have been mixed; Gold has seen some fluctuation but ended near its starting point, while Crude Oil has shown a consistent upward trend, ending higher at 88.15 from an initial 76.08, which may suggest rising energy costs. Lastly, currency exchange rates have seen the USD strengthening against the EUR and JPY but remaining relatively stable against the CNY, which could impact international trade dynamics and foreign investment flows.
