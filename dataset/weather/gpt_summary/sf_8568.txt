Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperature has experienced a general downward trend with slight fluctuations, indicating a cooling pattern. Humidity levels have been high and even reached saturation at one point, suggesting the possibility of fog or mist, particularly during the cooler early morning hours when temperatures were at their lowest. The air pressure has shown variability with periods of relative stability, which could be associated with the passage of a weather front through the area. Wind speeds have remained mostly light but picked up significantly towards the end of the period, which may disperse humidity and lead to clearer conditions. Wind direction has varied widely over the course of the day, which could be indicative of shifting weather patterns or the influence of local geographic features on wind flow.
