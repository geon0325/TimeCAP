Over the past 20 weeks, the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data indicates an upward trend in the ratio of ILI patients, surpassing the baseline of 2.9% at no point, thus suggesting a relatively stable influenza activity within the observed population. The age group of 25-49 consistently reported the highest number of ILI cases, which could indicate a higher transmission rate or susceptibility within this demographic. Notably, all age groups experienced a gradual increase in ILI cases, with the oldest age group (65 or more) showing a steady rise, potentially increasing the risk of complications and burden on healthcare services for this vulnerable population. The recent weeks have seen the highest ratios of ILI patients, suggesting a possible escalation in influenza activity or co-circulation with other respiratory viruses, which healthcare providers should monitor closely. Despite the increase in ILI ratios, the values remained well below the threshold of concern, indicating that the current healthcare system is not under significant stress from influenza but should remain vigilant for any changes in trends.
