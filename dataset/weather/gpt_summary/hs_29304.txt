Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a moderate fluctuation in temperature, with a noticeable dip and subsequent rise, which is indicative of a transition between day and night-time temperatures. Humidity levels varied significantly, showing higher values during the cooler early morning hours and dropping sharply as temperatures peaked, suggesting drier conditions during the warmest part of the day. The air pressure remained relatively high and stable throughout most of the period, though there was a brief and significant drop, potentially indicating a transient weather system passing through the area. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a couple of instances of higher wind speeds, and wind direction shifted throughout the day, suggesting a changing weather pattern. The combination of these conditions suggests a stable weather system with a typical diurnal cycle, though the brief pressure drop and variability in wind direction could imply the presence of transient weather systems influencing the local climate.
