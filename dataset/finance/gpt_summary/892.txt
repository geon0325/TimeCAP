Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown an overall upward trend, rising from 3936.69 to 4297.14, indicating a growing investor confidence or potential recovery from previous downtrends. The VIX, or Volatility Index, has decreased from 24.50 to 19.95, suggesting that market volatility has declined and investor sentiment may be stabilizing. The Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have both exhibited an upward trajectory, signaling strengthening markets in both Japan and the United Kingdom. Gold Futures have fluctuated but ended slightly higher, moving from 1710.00 to 1781.40, which could point to sustained investor caution amidst market recovery. In contrast, Crude Oil Futures have decreased from 104.22 to 89.41, potentially reflecting concerns about global demand or an oversupplied market, while the exchange rates for major currencies against the USD have remained relatively stable with mild appreciation in the EUR/USD and USD/CNY, and a slight depreciation in the USD/JPY pair.
