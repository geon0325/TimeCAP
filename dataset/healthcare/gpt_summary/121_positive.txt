Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable decline in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the ratio of positive specimens decreasing from a high of 27.06% in week 1 to 1.30% in week 20. Influenza A showed a more pronounced decrease in detection over the period, with the ratio of positive specimens dropping from 18.60% to 0.57%, suggesting a significant reduction in its prevalence. Conversely, Influenza B's presence, while also declining, has done so at a slower rate, with its ratio of positive specimens reducing from 8.47% to 0.73%. This overall downward trend indicates a decrease in influenza activity, which could lead to a reduction in related healthcare system strain. However, continuous surveillance is crucial to monitor for potential resurgences or new strains that could affect the population and healthcare resources.
