Over the past 20 weeks, the data indicates a steady increase in the percentage of patients presenting with Influenza-like Illness (ILI) across all age groups, peaking in the later weeks before a slight decline in the most recent data. The highest number of ILI cases has consistently been reported in the youngest age group, 0-4 years, suggesting a heightened vulnerability or exposure in this demographic. Notably, in the last few weeks, the ratio of ILI patients has surpassed the baseline threshold, indicating a significant upsurge that could potentially strain healthcare resources if the trend continues. The oldest age group, 65 or more, while having the least cases, has also seen a gradual rise in ILI incidence, which is concerning given the higher risk of complications in this population. The overall upward trend in ILI cases, especially as the ratio exceeds the baseline, may necessitate increased healthcare preparedness, including bolstering outpatient services, ensuring adequate medication and vaccine supplies, and possibly re-evaluating public health strategies to mitigate the spread of influenza.
