Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a discernible downward trend in the mortality ratio of influenza or pneumonia compared to total deaths, starting at 9.15% and ending at 5.95%, which is below the average ratio of 7.84%. Despite fluctuations, the total number of deaths exhibits a declining pattern, with a notable decrease from 70168 in the first week to 58363 in the last week, though a significant drop to 24395 was observed in the 18th week. Deaths from influenza have consistently decreased over the period, from 993 to 36, which suggests a possible reduction in influenza transmission or improved management. Pneumonia-related deaths also show an overall decrease, with occasional upticks, but the last data point indicates a minor increase from the previous week (3330 to 3435). These trends could indicate the need for ongoing surveillance and possibly adjusted resource allocation to manage the lower, yet persistent, impact of these respiratory diseases on the healthcare system.
