Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a moderate increase in temperature, indicative of a warming trend. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, with a notable peak suggesting the possibility of fog or mist formation, particularly when temperature and humidity were both high. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with a slight downward trend, which might suggest a minor system movement but was not indicative of any significant weather disturbance. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with an increase towards the end of the period, which could contribute to cooler perceived temperatures and the dispersal of any fog or mist. The wind direction varied considerably, with no dominant pattern, suggesting a lack of a strong weather front influencing the local climate during this time frame.
