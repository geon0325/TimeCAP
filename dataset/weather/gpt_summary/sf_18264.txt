Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures exhibited a mild fluctuation with a general cooling trend during the early hours, followed by a gradual warming towards the latter part of the day. Humidity levels were high and reached saturation at multiple points, indicating a likelihood of fog or mist, particularly during times of peak humidity. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, suggesting a stable and potentially improving weather pattern. Wind speeds were mostly light and showed a significant decrease in the latter half of the timeframe, which could lead to reduced dispersion of air pollutants and possibly affect air quality.
