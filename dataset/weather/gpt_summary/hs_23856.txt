Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have experienced a gradual increase, indicating a warming trend that reached its peak in the latter part of the period. Relative humidity levels showed a decrease through the time series, which, when coupled with rising temperatures, suggests a drier atmosphere moving into the area. Air pressure remained relatively stable with only minor fluctuations, indicating a steady weather pattern during this period. Wind speeds were consistently light, with no significant gusts, which is indicative of a calm weather scenario. The wind direction was predominantly from the south to southeast, which is typical for Houston and can contribute to the transport of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, potentially affecting local humidity levels.
