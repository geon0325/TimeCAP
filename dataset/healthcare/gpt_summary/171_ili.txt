Over the last 20 weeks, the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data indicates a consistent decrease in the ratio of ILI patients, with a recent slight uptick towards the end of the period. The age group 0-4 consistently reported the highest number of ILI cases, which may suggest a higher transmission or susceptibility within this demographic. There was a noticeable decline across all age groups in the number of ILI patients, reflecting a possible seasonal reduction in influenza activity. However, the recent increase in ILI ratios, although still below the baseline, should be monitored closely as it may indicate the beginning of an upward trend in ILI cases. The healthcare system should remain vigilant and prepared for a potential increase in demand for medical services, especially for the youngest age group, which has been most affected throughout the observed period.
