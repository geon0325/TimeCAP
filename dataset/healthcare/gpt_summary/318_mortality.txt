Over the last 20 weeks, the ratio of mortality due to Influenza or Pneumonia to the total number of deaths has consistently remained below the average of 7.84%, indicating a downward trend. The highest ratio recorded within this period was in the first week at 7.14%, with a gradual decline to the lowest value of 5.30% in the penultimate week. The total number of deaths from all causes started at 62,843 and showed a decreasing trend, reaching 55,771 by the end of the 20-week period. Deaths from pneumonia also decreased from 4,370 to 3,094, while deaths from influenza remained relatively low and stable, varying slightly around an average of approximately 50 deaths per week. This trend suggests a lower than average impact of these respiratory infections on overall mortality, which could imply either a milder influenza season, effective public health interventions, or a shift in the burden of disease to other causes.
