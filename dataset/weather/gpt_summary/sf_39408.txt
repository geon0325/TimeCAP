Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a noticeable temperature fluctuation with a clear warming trend during the day followed by a cooling trend moving into the night. Humidity levels showed significant variability, with marked decreases during the times when temperature peaked, and increases during the cooler periods, suggesting a typical diurnal cycle influenced by the local marine environment. Air pressure demonstrated a general increasing trend through most of the day, which typically indicates stable weather conditions, but ended with a sharp decline, possibly suggesting an approaching weather system. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate throughout the period, with a noticeable uptick during the afternoon hours, which could contribute to cooler conditions if persistent. The wind direction varied significantly, shifting from northeasterly to northerly, then to a predominantly southerly direction, reflecting the passage of a weather front and the complex topography of the San Francisco Bay Area.
