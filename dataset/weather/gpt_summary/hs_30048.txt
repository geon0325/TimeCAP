Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature with a slight fluctuation before stabilizing towards the end of the observed period. Humidity levels peaked at the time when temperatures were lowest, indicating a possible early morning fog or dew, which then decreased as temperatures rose during the day. Air pressure showed some variability with a noticeable drop towards the end of the period, which could suggest the potential for changing weather patterns or the approach of a weather front. Wind speeds varied, with an increase observed during the latter half of the day, possibly contributing to the dispersion of humidity and affecting the perceived temperature. The wind direction remained predominantly from the south-southeast throughout the day, which is typical for Houston and can bring in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, affecting local weather conditions.
