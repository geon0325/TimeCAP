Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has exhibited a typical diurnal pattern, with a peak during the daytime hours followed by a gradual decline overnight, reaching the lowest point just before dawn. Humidity levels remained high throughout the period, suggesting a muggy and potentially uncomfortable atmosphere for residents, with a slight decrease during the warmest part of the day. Atmospheric pressure has been slowly but steadily increasing, which can be indicative of stable weather conditions and possibly the approach of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds have varied, with a noticeable increase in the later hours, which could contribute to a change in weather patterns or the dispersal of any localized weather phenomena. The wind direction has shifted significantly, starting from a southerly direction and moving to a more northerly direction by the end of the 24-hour period, which could imply the passage of a weather front through the area.
