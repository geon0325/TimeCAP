Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have shown a significant diurnal variation, with a noticeable increase during the daylight hours followed by a decrease after sunset, which is typical due to solar heating and nighttime cooling. Humidity levels fluctuated, starting moderately, increasing significantly during the early morning hours likely due to cooler temperatures allowing the air to hold less moisture, and then dropping sharply towards the latter part of the period, suggesting drier air moving into the area. Air pressure experienced a slight decreasing trend, which indicates a change in the weather pattern, possibly associated with the approach of a weather front or system. Wind speeds were generally light and showed some variability, with a slight increase during the afternoon hours, which could be associated with the development of local breeze patterns due to heating. Wind direction was variable but predominantly from the north to northwest, shifting to more westerly and southerly directions at times, reflecting the passage of weather systems and the influence of local topography on wind flow.
