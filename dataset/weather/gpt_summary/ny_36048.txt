Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature followed by a moderate rise towards the latter part of the day, suggesting a typical diurnal pattern with cooler temperatures in the early hours and a warmer afternoon. Despite the fluctuation in temperatures, humidity levels remained relatively stable, with a slight increase during the coldest temperatures, possibly indicating some early morning moisture presence. Air pressure steadily increased throughout the period, which could be indicative of a high-pressure system moving into the area, often associated with settled weather conditions. Wind speeds varied, with a noticeable peak during the early hours, which then decreased and remained relatively calm, suggesting a less windy day overall. Wind direction was predominantly northerly, shifting slightly to westerly later on, which could influence the transportation of air masses and potentially affect local weather patterns, such as temperature and cloud cover.
