Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a gradual increase in the proportion of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases across all age groups, with the most substantial growth observed in the 0-4 and 5-24 age brackets. The percentage of ILI patients has risen consistently, surpassing the 2.9% severity benchmark in the last two weeks of the reported period, reaching a peak of 4.45% in the most recent week. This upward trend suggests a growing burden on the healthcare system, particularly in pediatric and young adult populations, potentially requiring additional resources for effective management. The notable escalation in ILI cases, especially during the last five weeks, indicates a possible outbreak or seasonality factor, necessitating public health interventions to mitigate further spread. Such an increase in ILI prevalence could lead to heightened demand for medical appointments, increased hospital admissions, and a need for elevated public health surveillance and response measures.
