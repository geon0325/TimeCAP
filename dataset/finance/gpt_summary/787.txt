Over the past 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with a general downtrend, declining from an initial high of 4471.07 to 4262.45, indicative of investor uncertainty. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, has remained elevated, at times surpassing 30 points, which suggests increased market anxiety. Meanwhile, international markets have mirrored this uncertainty, with the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 experiencing declines, though the FTSE 100's drop was notably sharper, reflecting heightened concerns in the European region. Commodity prices have seen fluctuations, with Gold Futures peaking at 2040.10 before retracting, and Crude Oil Futures spiking above $100, which could contribute to inflationary pressures. Exchange rates have shown a strengthening US dollar against the Euro and the Japanese Yen, while remaining relatively stable against the Chinese Yuan, signaling a potential shift towards safer assets amidst global financial instability.
