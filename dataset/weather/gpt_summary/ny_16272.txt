Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak during the late afternoon before stabilizing towards the evening. Humidity levels showed a decreasing trend as temperatures rose, indicative of typical diurnal variation, with lower humidity during the warmest part of the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with a slight increase midday, which could suggest stable weather conditions. Wind speeds were mostly light, with a slight increase towards the end of the period, while wind direction varied, predominantly coming from the south-southeast, shifting to westerly, and then veering to the south-southeast again. The combination of stable pressure, moderate temperature, and varying but gentle winds points to fair weather conditions likely to persist in the short term.
