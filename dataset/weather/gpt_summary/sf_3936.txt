Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures exhibited a decreasing trend overnight before stabilizing and slightly increasing during the daytime, which is typical due to diurnal variations. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, possibly due to lower temperatures and nocturnal cooling leading to condensation, and then gradually decreased as temperatures rose. Air pressure experienced some fluctuations, with a notable increase that suggests the presence or approach of a high-pressure system, which is often associated with stable and clear weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with some increase observed, indicating that breezy conditions may have developed. The wind direction varied significantly throughout the period, which could suggest variable weather patterns or the influence of local topography on wind flow.
