Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in the mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia, with a significant peak occurring between weeks 10 and 13 where the ratio of mortality from these causes to total deaths rose sharply, reaching a maximum of 10.89%, which is substantially higher than the 20-week average of 7.84%. Following this peak, there has been a gradual decline in the ratio, with the latest value standing at 8.00%, indicating a downward trend but still above the overall average. The week with the highest number of deaths attributed to Influenza was week 13, with 1626 deaths, which coincides with the peak in the mortality ratio, suggesting a potential outbreak or increased virulence of the influenza virus during this period. Despite the subsequent decline, the total number of deaths from pneumonia remains high, with the latest value at 4061, indicating that pneumonia continues to be a significant health concern. This pattern suggests that healthcare resources may have been heavily taxed during the peak period, but there should still be continued vigilance and resource allocation to address the ongoing impact of these respiratory illnesses.
