Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with a general downward trend, closing lower in the latest session at 3023.94 compared to 3345.78, which may indicate a bearish sentiment in the market. The VIX, or Volatility Index, has increased significantly from 14.96 to 39.62, suggesting a rise in market uncertainty and investor fear. Both the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 have mirrored this decline, with the Nikkei falling from 23873.59 to 21329.12 and the FTSE 100 dropping from 7504.80 to 6705.40, reflecting broader global market pressures. Gold futures have seen an upward trend, moving from 1565.10 to 1666.40, highlighting its status as a safe-haven asset amid market turmoil. The exchange rates have exhibited some fluctuations; however, the EUR/USD has generally appreciated from 1.10 to 1.11, while the USD/JPY has depreciated from 109.81 to 107.68, which could point to a slight weakening of the US dollar in currency markets.
