Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable upward trend in temperature, with the peak occurring in the late afternoon, which is typical for the region's diurnal pattern. Humidity levels have shown a significant decrease throughout the day, likely contributing to a sense of drier conditions by the evening, a pattern that often accompanies rising temperatures. Air pressure remained relatively stable with only minor fluctuations, indicating no immediate signs of major weather disturbances. Wind speeds were moderate and varied throughout the day, with a shift from southerly to northwesterly winds occurring, which could suggest the passage of a frontal system. The change in wind direction, coupled with decreasing humidity and stable pressure, might lead to clearer and drier weather conditions in the short term.
