Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has experienced significant volatility, with a low of 2237.40 and a rebound to 2630.07, before settling slightly lower at 2584.59, highlighting uncertainty in the equity markets. The VIX, or Fear Index, has remained elevated, peaking at 82.69, which suggests high investor anxiety and potential for continued market swings. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 have mirrored this turbulence, with the Nikkei dropping to a low of 17002.04 before recovering, and the FTSE 100 dipping below 5000 before regaining some ground, indicative of global market pressures.

Gold futures initially rose to 1674.50 as investors sought safe havens, but subsequently fell to 1583.40, reflecting a possible shift in investor sentiment or liquidity needs. Crude Oil Futures have plunged to historic lows, at one point dropping below $21 per barrel, indicative of a massive supply glut and weakened demand due to global economic slowdown, while currency exchange rates have seen the EUR/USD and USD/JPY fluctuate with the latter showing a strengthening of the Yen against the Dollar, and the USD/CNY pair remaining relatively stable, suggesting that currency markets are also experiencing heightened volatility amidst this economic uncertainty.
