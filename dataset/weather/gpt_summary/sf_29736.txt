Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a moderate temperature range, with temperatures peaking during the daytime and dipping during the night, as expected due to diurnal variation. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with peaks typically occurring in the early hours, suggesting possible early morning fog or mist, which is a common occurrence in the region. Air pressure showed a general decreasing trend throughout the period, which could indicate the approach of a weather system that may lead to changing weather conditions, potentially increasing the chance of precipitation or wind in the near future. Wind speeds were mostly light and variable, with a slight increase towards the end of the 24-hour period, while wind direction shifted frequently, suggesting variable weather patterns and the absence of a strong, dominant weather front during this time. Overall, the combination of falling air pressure, high humidity, and variable winds could suggest an increased likelihood of overcast skies or fog, potentially impacting visibility and local conditions.
