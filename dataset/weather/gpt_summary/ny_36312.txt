Over the past 24 hours in New York City, temperatures have experienced a gradual increase throughout the day, reaching a peak in the late afternoon before slowly declining again towards the evening. Humidity levels showed significant variation, maintaining stable values initially, but experienced a period of full saturation, which likely indicates the presence of fog or precipitation during that time, before returning to lower values as the temperatures peaked. Air pressure remained relatively steady with a slight increasing trend, suggesting stable weather conditions; however, minor fluctuations could imply the passage of a weather front or localized atmospheric changes. Wind speeds were moderate and decreased over time, with a notable drop towards the end of the period, which could lead to a calm night. Wind direction was predominantly from the northwest, though it varied throughout the day and ended with a significant shift to the northeast, which may bring in different weather patterns, such as cooler air from the ocean.
