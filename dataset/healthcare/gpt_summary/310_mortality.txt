Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the reported baseline average of 7.84%. The ratio peaked in the first three weeks, ranging from 13.15% to 13.74%, which is significantly higher than the average and indicates a potential seasonal surge or outbreak. Following this, there was a substantial drop in week 4 and a general downward trend, culminating in the lowest ratio of 6.15% in the final week, suggesting a decrease in the impact of these diseases or improved control measures. The total number of deaths fluctuated over the period with a high in week 3 (74,257) and a low in the last week (57,726), which might indicate other factors influencing overall mortality rates. The sharp rise in deaths attributed to influenza in week 4 (887) compared to surrounding weeks suggests a specific event or data anomaly, necessitating further investigation to understand its cause and healthcare implications.
