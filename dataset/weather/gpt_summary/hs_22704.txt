Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the latter part of the observed period, indicative of a warming trend. Humidity levels have shown a slight decline, which, in combination with rising temperatures, suggests an increase in overall comfort levels. Air pressure has been decreasing slowly, which could signal an approaching change in weather patterns, possibly leading to the development of unsettled weather. Wind speeds have remained relatively consistent with a slight uptick, while the wind direction has shifted gradually towards the south-southeast, which may contribute to the transportation of moisture into the area. Overall, the combination of these weather indicators points towards a stable yet evolving weather pattern, with the potential for increased warmth and a slight chance of changing conditions in the near future.
