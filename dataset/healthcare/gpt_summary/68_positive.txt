Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with an initial increase followed by a subsequent decline. The data shows a peak in the ratio of positive specimens around week 4, with a value of 24.51%, which then gradually decreases to a low of 3.39% by week 20. Influenza A has consistently been more prevalent than Influenza B, but both subtypes have followed a similar downward trend in positive specimen ratios after reaching their respective peaks (Influenza A at 20.21% in week 3 and Influenza B at 11.26% in week 10). This decrease in positive specimens suggests a waning phase of the influenza season, which may lead to reduced strain on healthcare resources dedicated to flu treatment and prevention. However, healthcare systems should remain vigilant for possible new outbreaks and maintain influenza surveillance to inform vaccine development and public health interventions.
