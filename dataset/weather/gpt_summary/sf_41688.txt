Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature, exhibiting a general decrease during the earlier hours, followed by a gradual increase, peaking during the late afternoon. Humidity levels remained high for the majority of the period, with a significant drop midday, which could have led to a feeling of dryness before rising again. Air pressure experienced some variability, with a notable drop and subsequent rise that suggests the passage of a frontal system, potentially affecting weather patterns such as wind speed and precipitation. Wind speeds were mostly light but picked up significantly during the afternoon, possibly contributing to cooler conditions if coming from the ocean. Wind directions were variable throughout the day, with a mix of land and sea breezes, which could have implications for coastal fog development and dispersal.
