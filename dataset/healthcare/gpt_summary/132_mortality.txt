Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia in relation to the total number of deaths has demonstrated a gradual increase from 5.20% to 6.04%, surpassing the 20-week average of 5.51%, which is below the stated average of 7.84%. The total number of deaths fluctuated slightly but showed an overall increasing trend from 51,636 to 55,060. Deaths specifically attributed to influenza have increased steadily from 5 to 38, which represents a more than sevenfold rise. Pneumonia-related deaths also rose from 2,679 to 3,287, indicating a consistent upward trend. These trends suggest a growing impact of Influenza and Pneumonia on overall mortality, which could signal a need for increased healthcare resources and public health interventions to address the rise in cases and prevent further mortality.
