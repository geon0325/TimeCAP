Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced stable temperatures with a gradual increase towards the latter part of the time series, indicating a slight warming trend. Humidity levels remained extremely high throughout the day, only showing a modest decrease in the last few hours, which could contribute to a muggy feeling in the air. Air pressure was consistent but showed a slight decline, suggesting a possible change in weather patterns could be on the horizon. Wind speeds were generally light and increased slightly as the day progressed, which may not have provided much relief from the humidity. The wind direction was predominantly from the east-southeast, which is typical for Houston and can bring moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, potentially maintaining the high humidity levels.
