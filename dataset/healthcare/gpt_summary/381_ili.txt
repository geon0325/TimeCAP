Over the last 20 weeks, the proportion of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases among the total patient count has not exceeded the benchmark of 2.9%, indicating a relatively mild influenza season thus far. However, there was a noticeable peak in ILI cases for patients aged 0-4 early in the period, with numbers gradually declining since. The data show a more pronounced decrease in ILI cases among the 5-24 age group after an initial surge, aligning with seasonal patterns often seen in school-aged populations. The ILI percentages have been steadily below the benchmark since week nine, with the most recent weeks showing a slight uptick but still remaining under 2%. Despite the overall ILI rates staying below the threshold of concern, the slight increase in the latter weeks warrants close monitoring to ensure healthcare systems are prepared for any potential uptick in cases.
