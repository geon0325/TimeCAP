Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant increase in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the total positivity rate growing from 1.90% to 22.78%. The percentage of specimens testing positive for Influenza A has shown a more pronounced rise compared to Influenza B, with Influenza A positivity rates escalating from 1.10% to 19.24%. Meanwhile, Influenza B has also seen a substantial increase but at a slower rate, from 0.80% to 3.54%. This surge in influenza cases, especially Influenza A, may lead to increased hospitalizations, a higher burden on healthcare resources, and a potential need for heightened public health interventions. The data reflects a possible outbreak situation that could strain healthcare systems, suggesting the need for healthcare providers to prepare for increased clinical demand and potential vaccination and prevention campaigns.
