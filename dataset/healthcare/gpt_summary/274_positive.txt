Over the past 20 weeks, the data indicates a fluctuating but generally low percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with an average positivity rate of 6.26%. Influenza B has consistently been more prevalent than Influenza A, with its lowest positivity rate at 0.03% and the highest at 0.21%, compared to Influenza A's range of 0.03% to 0.08%. There was a noticeable decrease in the overall ratio of positive specimens from week 1 (0.27%) to week 20 (0.15%), suggesting a downward trend in influenza cases. However, the ratio of positive specimens for Influenza A has seen a slight increase in recent weeks from 0.03% in week 17 to 0.08% in week 20. This data is important for healthcare providers and public health officials to monitor and manage influenza activity, allocate resources effectively, and potentially adjust vaccination and prevention strategies.
