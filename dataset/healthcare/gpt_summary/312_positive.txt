Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable increase in the number of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a peak ratio of positive specimens reaching 6.23% in week 12, before gradually declining to 2.94% by week 20. Influenza A has been the predominant strain, with its highest positivity rate at 6.17% in week 12, which then decreased to 2.86% by the end of the period, indicating a subsiding trend. Influenza B has remained a minor contributor to the overall influenza positivity rate, maintaining a relatively steady presence with its positivity rate fluctuating slightly around the 0.06% mark throughout the period. The total number of specimens tested peaked at 150,872 in week 14, suggesting increased testing during the height of influenza activity. Given the recent decline in positivity rates, healthcare systems may soon experience a reprieve from the heightened demand for influenza-related medical care and resources seen during the peak weeks.
