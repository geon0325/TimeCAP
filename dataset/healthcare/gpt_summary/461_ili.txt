Over the last 20 weeks, the proportion of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases among patients has consistently exceeded the 2.9% benchmark, indicating a sustained elevated incidence of ILI in the population. The peak of ILI activity occurred between weeks 6 and 7, with rates reaching 6.31% and 6.90% respectively, suggesting a significant strain on healthcare resources during this period. Following the peak, there has been a gradual decline in ILI rates, yet they remain above the threshold, with the latest value at 3.15%. Notably, the highest rates of ILI were recorded in the 5-24 age group, which may indicate higher transmission within this demographic, potentially affecting school and workplace attendance. Despite the decreasing trend, the persistent ILI rates above the baseline necessitate continued public health vigilance and resource allocation to manage ongoing healthcare demands.
