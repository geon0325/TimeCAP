Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have followed a typical diurnal pattern, starting off warmer, cooling through the night, and warming up again during the day. Humidity levels experienced significant fluctuations, with an extremely high percentage during the early hours, indicating the presence of considerable moisture in the air, which decreased sharply towards the afternoon, suggesting drier conditions. Atmospheric pressure showed slight variability with a tendency to decrease overall, which could be indicative of a changing weather system moving into the area. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with no significant gusts, and wind direction varied, primarily coming from the west-northwest, shifting to a more southerly direction and then returning to a westerly flow. This combination of light winds, varying humidity, and steady pressure suggests stable weather conditions, but the pressure trend might hint at an approaching weather system that could alter conditions in the near future.
