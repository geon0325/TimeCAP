Over the last 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has experienced a notable diurnal fluctuation, peaking in the late afternoon and reaching its lowest point in the early morning hours, which is typical given the city's geographical location and climate. Humidity levels have been quite high, even hitting saturation at certain points, suggesting the possibility of fog or heavy dew, especially when coinciding with the lower night-time temperatures. The air pressure has remained relatively stable throughout the day, with a slight increase towards the end of the period, indicating steady weather patterns with no immediate signs of significant weather fronts moving in. Wind speeds have varied, with a couple of instances of higher gusts, which could contribute to cooler perceived temperatures and possibly influence the dispersal of humidity and any localized precipitation. Wind direction has been mostly from the south to south-west, with some variability, which is consistent with warm air being drawn up from the Gulf of Mexico, contributing to the overall humidity experienced in the area.
