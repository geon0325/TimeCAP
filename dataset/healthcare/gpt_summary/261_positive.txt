The time-series data over the last 20 weeks indicates a fluctuating but overall low incidence of influenza, with the percentage of positive specimens ranging from 0.13% to 0.39%, and averaging 6.26%, which is relatively low. While both Influenza A and B are present, Influenza B has consistently shown higher positivity rates, peaking at 0.21% in contrast to Influenza A's peak of 0.20%. There has been a decrease in the number of specimens tested from the highest count in week 8 (42,526) to week 20 (32,424), which could potentially mask the true incidence of influenza. The overall trend shows a decrease in positivity rates for both Influenza A and B towards the latter weeks, with the last week reaching a joint low of 0.13%. This data is essential for healthcare planning and resource allocation, as it suggests that while influenza is currently at low levels, ongoing surveillance is necessary to monitor for any sudden increases or changes in trends that could impact healthcare services.
