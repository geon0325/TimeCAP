Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, followed by a moderate increase as the day progressed, indicating typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels saw minor fluctuations but remained relatively stable, with a slight increase during the cooler early morning hours, which is common as cooler air can hold less moisture. Air pressure remained steady, with a slight upward trend, suggesting stable weather conditions without the presence of significant weather fronts or systems. Wind speeds were variable, starting higher and decreasing towards the middle of the day, before picking back up later on, which could contribute to changes in temperature and humidity as different air masses move through. Wind direction was predominantly westerly with some variation, which is typical for San Francisco due to its coastal location and the influence of marine breezes.
