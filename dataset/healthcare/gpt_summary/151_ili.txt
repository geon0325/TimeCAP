The Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data over the past 20 weeks indicate a significant seasonal fluctuation, with the ratio of ILI patients peaking well above the baseline of 2.9% and showing a gradual decline in more recent weeks. The age group of 5-24 years consistently exhibited the highest number of ILI cases, suggesting that this demographic may be the most affected or has the highest rate of transmission. A notable rise in ILI incidence was observed across all age groups during the peak weeks, which could have led to increased demands on healthcare resources, such as outpatient services and potentially hospitalizations. The subsequent decline in the ILI ratio across all age groups suggests a tapering off of the season, which may alleviate some of the pressure on the healthcare system. However, the sustained elevation above the baseline for several weeks underlines the importance of continuous monitoring and preparedness in healthcare settings to address such seasonal outbreaks.
