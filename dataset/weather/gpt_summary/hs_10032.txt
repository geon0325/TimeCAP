Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced relatively stable temperatures with a minor fluctuation, indicative of stable weather conditions. Humidity levels were high throughout much of the day, which could have contributed to a feeling of mugginess, though there was a noticeable drop in humidity during the midday hours. Air pressure remained significantly high, suggesting a continued period of fair weather, though there was a brief dip which might have been associated with a transient weather event. Wind speeds varied moderately, maintaining mostly gentle to moderate breezes, with the wind direction showing a shift from northerly to westerly and back, which is typical of passing weather systems. Overall, the combination of high humidity, stable temperature, and high pressure would likely result in mostly clear skies with potential for morning fog or mist due to the humidity levels.
