Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a slight decrease in temperature followed by a gradual warming trend, indicating typical diurnal variation with no significant temperature extremes. Humidity levels have remained consistently high, suggesting a persistent presence of moisture in the air which could lead to foggy conditions, especially in coastal and low-lying areas. Air pressure showed a temporary increase before stabilizing and then decreasing slightly, which may indicate a passing high-pressure system followed by a return to more neutral conditions. Wind speeds were moderate to light throughout the period, with occasional increases that could influence wind chill factors and disperse any fog or low clouds. The wind direction has been variable, predominantly from the south to southwest, which is common for the region and may bring in moisture from the ocean, contributing to the high humidity levels observed.
