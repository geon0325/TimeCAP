Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the later hours before showing a slight decline. The humidity levels were variable but significantly peaked during the coolest temperatures, indicative of a possible marine layer influence or fog formation typical of the region's microclimate. Air pressure showed a notable decrease, suggesting the movement of a weather system into the area which could lead to changing weather conditions such as increased wind speeds or precipitation. Wind speed fluctuated, with a marked increase during midday, which, combined with higher wind gusts, could have implications for cooler onshore breezes affecting local conditions. The wind direction was predominantly from the west and northwest, which is standard for the region, but there were brief shifts to northerly and easterly directions, possibly due to local topographical influences or passing weather systems.
