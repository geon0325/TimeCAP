In the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, indicating a warming trend that peaked during the latter part of the time series. Humidity levels showed a general decrease over the same period, which typically suggests a more comfortable and less muggy atmosphere. Air pressure was observed to be decreasing slightly, which could signal an approaching weather system that may lead to changes in the current conditions. Wind speeds were mostly light, with occasional moderate gusts, and the wind direction was variable throughout the day, showing no consistent pattern. The combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and falling air pressure could potentially lead to the development of unsettled weather in the near future.
