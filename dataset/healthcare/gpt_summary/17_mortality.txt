Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a fluctuating but generally decreasing trend in the ratio of mortality due to Influenza or Pneumonia relative to total deaths, with the ratio starting at 6.40% and ending at 5.86%, remaining consistently below the average of 7.84%. Despite a slight increase in the number of deaths attributed to pneumonia in the final week, there has been a gradual decline in pneumonia-related deaths from week 1 (3308 deaths) to week 19 (2825 deaths), before the uptick to 3021 in week 20. Influenza-related deaths have remained low and exhibited a downward trend, with the highest number of deaths in week 1 (63 deaths) and reaching the lowest figures towards the latter part of the 20-week period, with a slight increase to 7 in the last week. The overall decline in the percentage of deaths from these respiratory conditions suggests an improvement in the management or a seasonal reduction of these illnesses. However, the healthcare system should remain vigilant, as any upward trends in the mortality ratio could indicate a resurgence that may require increased healthcare resources and intervention.
