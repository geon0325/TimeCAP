Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable increase in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia relative to total deaths, starting at 5.66% and peaking at 10.89% in week 16, before slightly declining to 9.71% in week 20. This increase in the ratio is significantly above the average of 7.84%, suggesting a worsening trend in mortality due to these respiratory conditions. The sharpest rise occurred between weeks 13 and 16, coinciding with a dramatic spike in deaths attributed to influenza, which rose from 92 to 1626. Total deaths also peaked during this period, reaching their highest at 67,495 in week 15, which may indicate a strain on healthcare resources. The data suggests a potential healthcare crisis, possibly driven by a severe influenza season or an outbreak, necessitating immediate public health attention and resources to mitigate further impact.
