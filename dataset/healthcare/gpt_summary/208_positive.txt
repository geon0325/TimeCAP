Over the past 20 weeks, the data indicates a rising trend in the number of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the average ratio of positive specimens reaching 6.26%. Influenza A has shown a particularly significant increase, with its positivity ratio nearly doubling from 0.69% to 19.31%, suggesting a dominant strain this season. Meanwhile, Influenza B's positivity ratio also escalated but peaked at week 15 with a 17.59% positivity rate before declining to 10.37% in week 20. The overall positivity rate for influenza specimens reached a peak at week 19 with 30.26% before a slight decrease to 29.68% in week 20. This upward trend highlights a need for increased healthcare resources, including vaccination efforts and antiviral stockpiling, to manage the rising incidence of influenza infections.
