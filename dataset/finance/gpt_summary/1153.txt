Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown moderate volatility with a slight upward trend, closing higher at 4497.63 after dipping to a low of 4370.36. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, has decreased overall, indicating a potential increase in investor confidence as it moved from 16.09 to 14.45. Global markets have reflected a mix of trends with the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 both experiencing fluctuations but ultimately closing higher, suggesting resilience in these markets despite ongoing challenges. Gold Futures have seen a mild increase from 1937.40 to 1936.50, which could be interpreted as a sustained investor hedge against inflation or market uncertainty. Meanwhile, currency exchange rates have shown the USD strengthening against the JPY and remaining relatively stable against the CNY, while the EUR/USD pair shows the Euro weakening against the Dollar, which may influence international trade dynamics and cross-border investment flows.
