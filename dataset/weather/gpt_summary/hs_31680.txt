Over the past 24 hours, the weather in Houston has experienced a gradual rise in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before cooling down slightly at night. Humidity levels were very high, frequently hitting saturation, which could have led to a feeling of oppressiveness and may have been a precursor to fog or dew. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable, with only minor fluctuations, indicating steady weather conditions without any significant fronts moving through the area. Wind speeds varied modestly throughout the period, with a notable increase in the evening, suggesting the possibility of a weather change or front approaching. The wind direction shifted significantly in the evening, moving from a predominantly southerly to a northerly direction, which is often associated with the passage of a cold front or the arrival of cooler air masses.
