Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced relatively stable temperatures with a slight cooling trend observed recently. Humidity levels have remained at saturation for most of the day, suggesting the presence of dense fog or persistent precipitation, but there was a minor decrease in humidity levels later on. Air pressure has seen slight fluctuation, with an overall increase towards the end of the period, which could indicate improving weather conditions. Wind speeds were moderate and increased slightly, with a notable shift in wind direction from southeasterly to northwesterly, which is consistent with the passage of a weather front through the area. The combination of high humidity, changing wind direction, and rising air pressure suggests that New York City may have been on the trailing edge of a weather system, potentially leading to clearer skies in the near future.
