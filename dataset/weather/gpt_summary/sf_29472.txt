Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have shown a notable fluctuation, moving from relatively warmer conditions to cooler temperatures in the early hours, before gradually warming up again towards the end of the period. Humidity levels experienced significant variation, with a period of saturation suggesting the possibility of fog or mist, especially during the night and early morning, followed by a sharp decrease which could indicate clearer conditions later in the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increasing trend, indicative of steady weather conditions and potentially contributing to the clearing of earlier high humidity levels. Wind speeds were generally light with a brief period of calm; however, towards the end of the time series, there was an increase in wind speed, which could help to disperse any lingering moisture in the air.
