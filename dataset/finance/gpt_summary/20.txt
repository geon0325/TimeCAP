Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a general upward trend, increasing from 2704.10 to 2784.49, which suggests a positive sentiment among investors. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, has remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, ending slightly lower than it started, which indicates that market volatility has not seen significant changes during this period. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 indices have both experienced volatility with the Nikkei showing an overall increase, while the FTSE has seen a slight decline, reflecting mixed performance in international markets. Gold and Crude Oil futures have both experienced some upward movement, with gold increasing from 1319.70 to 1312.80 and crude oil rising from 53.79 to 57.22, which may indicate a hedge against market uncertainty and increased energy demand respectively. Exchange rates have remained relatively stable for EUR/USD and USD/CNY, while the USD/JPY has shown a slight appreciation, suggesting steady currency markets with a modest increase in the strength of the US dollar against the Japanese yen.
