Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has shown a typical diurnal pattern with a peak during the afternoon hours and a gradual decrease towards the early morning, before rising again. Humidity levels have fluctuated significantly, reaching saturation at one point, which could have implications for fog or dew formation, especially during the early hours when temperatures were lower. Air pressure has been relatively stable with only minor fluctuations, indicating a steady weather pattern without immediate signs of significant weather systems moving in. Wind speeds have varied, with some calmer periods and occasional gusts, suggesting variable wind conditions that could affect outdoor activities. The wind direction has been predominantly from the south to southeasterly, with some variability, which is typical for Houston and could contribute to the transport of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico into the area.
