Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with an initial increase followed by a correction, ending slightly higher than the starting point, suggesting a level of investor uncertainty. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, has generally decreased from 31.77 to 21.16, indicating a reduction in market fear and potential stabilization. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 have shown resilience with both indices trending upwards, reflecting positive sentiment in the Asian and European markets, respectively. Gold Futures experienced some fluctuations but ended slightly lower, indicating that investors may be shifting focus to higher-yielding assets as market conditions stabilize. Currency exchange rates have remained relatively stable, with minor fluctuations in EUR/USD and USD/CNY, while USD/JPY has shown a clear strengthening of the dollar against the yen, which could imply a shift in trade balance dynamics and investor preference for dollar-denominated assets.
