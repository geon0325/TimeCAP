Over the past 20 market days, the S&P 500 has experienced heightened volatility, as indicated by a decline from 3757.99 to 3695.16, with interim fluctuations reflecting investor uncertainty. The VIX, or Volatility Index, remained elevated, starting at 27.35 and ending at 30.76, a sign of persistent market anxiety. The Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 both showed resilience with a slight upward trend despite some daily losses, ending higher than their starting points. Gold Futures prices decreased from 1670.80 to 1627.50, suggesting a shift in investor preference away from safe-haven assets. Exchange rates saw the USD strengthen against the JPY and CNY, while the EUR/USD pair fluctuated, ending slightly higher, which may influence international trade dynamics and cross-border investment flows.
