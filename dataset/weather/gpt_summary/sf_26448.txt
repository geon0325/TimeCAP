Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a noticeable decline in temperature from a peak during the early hours, stabilizing at a cooler range towards the night. Humidity levels showed significant variation, with peaks aligning with the cooler temperatures, indicating possible morning and late evening fogs or higher moisture content in the air. Air pressure readings were generally stable but showed a significant fluctuation mid-day which could be associated with transient weather systems passing through the area. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with a couple of instances of higher gusts, suggesting breezy conditions that could affect coastal activities. The wind direction shifted throughout the day, primarily coming from a westerly direction, which is typical for the region, bringing in cool ocean air and potentially contributing to the variability in humidity and temperature.
