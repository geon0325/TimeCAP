Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual decline in temperature, indicative of a cooling trend that culminated in a marked drop toward the end of the period. Humidity levels remained relatively high throughout, with a slight decrease in the latter hours, which may have contributed to a feeling of cooler conditions. Air pressure saw a general decreasing trend initially but later stabilized and even slightly increased, suggesting a stable weather pattern might be setting in. Wind speeds were consistent and increased towards the end of the period, which, coupled with a significant shift in wind direction from southerly to northwesterly, could be indicative of a frontal passage through the area. This shift in wind direction and the increase in wind speed could lead to clearer skies but also cooler temperatures in the immediate forecast.
