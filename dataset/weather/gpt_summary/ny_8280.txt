Over the past 24 hours, the temperature in New York City has exhibited a general downward trend, indicating a cooling of the weather. Humidity levels have fluctuated but showed a decrease during the warmest parts of the day, which is typical due to the inverse relationship between temperature and relative humidity. An increase in air pressure was observed, which usually suggests the approach of a high-pressure system, often associated with clearer and calmer weather conditions. Wind speeds remained relatively constant with a slight increase towards the current hour, which could contribute to a perceived drop in temperature due to wind chill. The wind direction has been predominantly from the south-southwest, but a notable shift was observed in the middle of the day, which could be associated with the change in weather patterns or the passage of a weather front.
