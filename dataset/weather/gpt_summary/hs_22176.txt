Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a slight fluctuation in temperature, maintaining a generally warm trend. Humidity levels have been high, frequently reaching saturation, which could lead to a muggy feeling and the possibility of fog or mist, especially during the early morning or night. Atmospheric pressure has been relatively stable and high, indicating settled weather conditions with little chance of precipitation. Wind speeds have remained light throughout the period, suggesting limited dispersion of air pollutants and thus potentially lower air quality. The wind direction has been variable, mostly coming from the south-southeast, which is typical for Houston and could contribute to bringing in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico.
