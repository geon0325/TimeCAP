Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a peak positivity rate of 24.73% in week 10, followed by a gradual decline to 6.77% in week 20. Influenza A has consistently been the predominant strain, reaching a maximum positivity of 20.21% in week 9, but it has since decreased to 1.73% in week 20, indicating a significant reduction in its prevalence. Conversely, Influenza B showed a delayed peak positivity rate of 10.56% by week 14, suggesting a different seasonal pattern from Influenza A, but it also has been on a decline to 5.03% by week 20. The initial increase and subsequent decrease in positivity rates may reflect the typical seasonality of influenza, with a surge in cases during the colder months and a reduction as the season ends. These trends are important for healthcare planning, as they indicate a current downward trend in influenza cases, but they also highlight the need for continued surveillance and vaccination efforts to manage potential future outbreaks.
