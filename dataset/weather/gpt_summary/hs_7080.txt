Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature exhibited a typical diurnal pattern, with the warmest conditions occurring in the late afternoon and cooler temperatures prevailing during the overnight and early morning hours. Humidity levels showed significant variation, reaching their peak at the same time as the lowest temperatures, which suggests the presence of early morning moisture that could have led to fog or dew. Air pressure experienced a slight overall decrease, indicating a potential shift towards less stable weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate throughout the period, with a few hours in the afternoon when they were slightly higher, possibly adding a cooling effect during the warmest part of the day.
