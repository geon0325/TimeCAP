Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature with a noticeable peak during the late afternoon hours before a slight decline towards the evening, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels initially dropped but then increased significantly overnight, maintaining high values that suggest a muggy and uncomfortable atmosphere. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with only minor fluctuations observed, indicating a steady weather pattern without immediate signs of significant weather fronts or systems moving in. Wind speeds were consistently light, with no significant gusts or changes, which could lead to stagnation and the potential for air quality issues. The wind direction showed a slight variability but remained predominantly from the northeast, which is not uncommon for this region and time of year.
