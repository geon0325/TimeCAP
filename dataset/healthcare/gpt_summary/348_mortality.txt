Over the last 20 weeks, there has been an observable increase in the proportion of deaths attributed to influenza and pneumonia compared to total mortality, rising from a ratio of 5.89% to a peak of 9.15% before slightly decreasing to 8.47%. This trend exceeds the average ratio of mortality from these causes (7.84%), suggesting a worsening impact of these respiratory diseases on population health. The most significant jump in influenza-related deaths occurred between the 9th and 12th weeks, where mortality nearly doubled, aligning with a similar, although less pronounced, rise in pneumonia deaths. Total deaths fluctuated, reaching a peak in the 16th week at 70,168, coinciding with the highest ratio of influenza or pneumonia mortality at 9.15%, indicating a potential strain on healthcare resources. The data indicates a need for increased vigilance and resource allocation to manage and mitigate the impact of respiratory diseases, especially during weeks where there is a spike in mortality rates.
