Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a marked decline in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with an initial ratio of 9.89% dropping to a low of 0.48% before a slight increase to 0.59% in the most recent week. The majority of positive cases throughout the period were of Influenza A, which followed a similar downward trend from 9.85% to 0.42%, while Influenza B remained relatively stable and marginal, ranging from 0.04% to 0.07%. The highest number of specimens tested occurred in week 5 (84,554), which coincides with the period of higher positivity rates, indicating a possible peak of the flu season. The consistent decrease in positive specimens suggests a waning flu season or effective control measures, but the recent minor uptick warrants continued surveillance to manage potential resurgences. The healthcare system may experience a temporary reprieve in flu-related demands, allowing for reallocation of resources, but should remain vigilant and prepared for a potential increase in cases.
