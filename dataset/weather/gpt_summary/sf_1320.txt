Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have experienced a gradual decline, reaching a minimum in the early hours before slowly climbing back up as the day progressed. Humidity levels showed significant variability, with a notable spike in the early evening, indicating the possibility of fog or mist formation, particularly when temperatures were at their lowest. Air pressure remained relatively stable but showed a slight downward trend, which could suggest a minor change in weather patterns, possibly leading to increased cloudiness or a chance of precipitation. Wind speeds generally decreased throughout the period, with calmer conditions prevailing later in the day; however, shifts in wind direction were observed, which could contribute to changes in temperature and humidity levels. The combination of these factors suggests a stable weather pattern with the potential for morning fog and cooler night temperatures.
