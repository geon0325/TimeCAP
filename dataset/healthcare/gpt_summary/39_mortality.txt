Over the past 20 weeks, the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to total deaths has shown an upward trend, beginning below the 20-week average of 7.84% and culminating in recent weeks that substantially exceed this average. The number of deaths attributable to Influenza or Pneumonia has increased markedly, with a notable spike in Influenza-related deaths starting from week 13, suggesting a potential outbreak or increased virulence of the Influenza virus. The highest ratios of mortality from these illnesses were recorded in weeks 14 through 18, where the ratios ranged from 9.56% to 10.89%, indicating a significant burden on the healthcare system and possibly reflecting seasonal patterns or vaccine effectiveness issues. Despite a slight decrease in the last two data points, the mortality ratio remains high at 9.67% in week 20, suggesting sustained pressure on healthcare resources. These trends underscore the importance of continued surveillance and potentially increased healthcare resource allocation to manage and mitigate the impact of respiratory infections on the population.
