Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature demonstrated a warming trend, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before experiencing a slight dip in the evening. Humidity levels fluctuated considerably, starting lower, peaking at full saturation midday, and then gradually declining towards the evening, indicative of variable atmospheric moisture throughout the day. Air pressure saw a general increase during the first half of the day, followed by a more stable period, suggesting a period of settled weather. Wind speeds remained mostly light and calm, with a slight increase towards the end of the period, which would have minimal impact on conditions at the surface. The wind direction was predominantly from the southeast, shifting throughout the day but returning to a southerly component by the end, which is typical for the region and can contribute to moisture transport from the Gulf of Mexico.
