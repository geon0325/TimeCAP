Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, followed by a notable increase during the daytime, and a subsequent decrease in the late hours, indicative of a typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels started high during the early hours, then significantly dropped towards the afternoon, suggesting drier air moving into the area. Air pressure saw a steady increase throughout the early part of the day, stabilizing during the midday hours, and then displayed a slight decrease, which could be associated with a transient high-pressure system affecting the region. Wind speeds were moderate to low, with some variability, but without any significant gusts that would indicate a strong weather system passing through. The wind direction was predominantly from the northern quadrant, shifting slightly to the west later in the day, which is consistent with the passage of a frontal system moving eastward.
