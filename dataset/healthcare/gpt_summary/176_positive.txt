The time-series data demonstrates a significant decline in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza over the last 20 weeks, with a peak positive ratio of 26.24% in week 1 dropping to 2.43% by week 20. The overall average positive rate of 6.26% indicates that the later weeks have had a markedly lower incidence of influenza compared to the earlier weeks. Influenza A has been the predominant strain throughout the period, although its incidence has also decreased substantially, from a peak of 25.36% to 1.46% in positive specimen ratios. Despite a lower prevalence, Influenza B has shown a less pronounced decline and a relatively stable pattern in the ratio of positive specimens, suggesting sustained but low transmission. The observed downtrend in influenza activity is likely to reduce the burden on healthcare resources but continued surveillance is essential to monitor potential upticks or strain variations.
