Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a fluctuation in the number of patients presenting with Influenza-like Illness (ILI), with a clear increase in recent weeks among all age groups. Notably, the highest number of ILI cases was observed among the age group 25-49, which suggests a heightened vulnerability or exposure in this demographic. Despite these variances, the ratio of ILI patients to total patients has consistently remained below the baseline threshold that typically indicates a more widespread influenza outbreak. While the current ratio does not suggest an immediate cause for alarm, the increasing trend in ILI cases, especially in the 25-49 age group, warrants continued monitoring and potentially increased preparedness in healthcare settings to manage a potential surge. It is essential for public health authorities to stay vigilant and possibly investigate the underlying causes of the uptick in ILI cases to mitigate any future impact on the healthcare system.
