Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with an initial uptrend followed by a sharp decline, closing lower at 3979.87 from a high of 4305.20, indicating increased market uncertainty and potential investor caution. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, has fluctuated but trended upwards, peaking at 26.91, which corresponds with the observed instability in equity markets. International markets have mirrored this uncertainty, with Japan's Nikkei 225 and the UK's FTSE 100 both experiencing declines, closing at 27430.30 and 7237.80 respectively, which suggests a broader global market reticence. Commodity prices have seen downward pressure, with Crude Oil Futures falling to 81.94 from a high of 94.34, and Gold Futures have also decreased, yet the latter has shown signs of a safe-haven appeal with a slight rebound to 1715.30. Currency markets have seen the USD strengthening against the EUR and JPY but weakening against the CNY, indicating mixed sentiment towards the dollar amidst global economic uncertainties.
