Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced relatively stable temperatures with slight fluctuations, generally remaining within a narrow range, indicative of a lack of any significant frontal activity or drastic weather changes. Humidity levels have been consistently high, suggesting a heavy presence of moisture in the air which could lead to foggy conditions, particularly in coastal and low-lying areas. Air pressure has remained steady and relatively high, which is often associated with settled weather conditions and may imply a continuation of current weather patterns in the short term. Wind speeds have seen a gradual increase throughout the day, potentially contributing to cooler perceived temperatures and possibly dispersing any fog or low-lying cloud cover. The wind direction has predominantly shifted from a westerly to a southerly direction, which may influence local temperatures and could bring in air masses from different regions, affecting local weather conditions.
