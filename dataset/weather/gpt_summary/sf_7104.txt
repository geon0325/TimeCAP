Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before a slight dip towards the evening. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, with a notable drop during the time when temperatures were at their highest, which is typical as warmer air can hold more moisture, thereby reducing relative humidity. Air pressure varied within a narrow range but saw a significant dip, suggesting the possible passage of a weather front or the development of a low-pressure system during the day. Wind speeds remained generally light but spiked sharply concurrent with the drop in air pressure, indicating a likely increase in wind activity possibly associated with the aforementioned changes in pressure. The predominant wind direction was from the west-southwest, with a notable shift to the northwest during the peak wind speed period, which could influence coastal conditions and potentially bring cooler ocean air inland.
