Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have exhibited a mild diurnal variation, with a general cooling trend during the nighttime hours and a warming trend during the daytime, consistent with typical patterns. Humidity levels have varied, increasing significantly overnight which is indicative of the coastal influence on the city's microclimate, possibly leading to morning fog or dew. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable with a slight fluctuation, which suggests a period of steady weather without the immediate influence of strong frontal systems. Wind speeds were light throughout the day, indicating calm weather conditions that are unlikely to have resulted in significant wind chill effects or disrupted outdoor activities. The wind direction was predominantly from the west and southwest, which is a common pattern for San Francisco, often bringing in marine air from the Pacific Ocean and affecting local climate conditions.
