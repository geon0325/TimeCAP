Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable increase in the mortality ratio of Influenza and Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, starting at 8.17% and rising to a peak of 16.83% in the penultimate week, which significantly exceeds the average ratio of 7.84%. The raw number of deaths attributed to Influenza has remained relatively low and stable; however, deaths from Pneumonia have shown a marked increase, from 4873 in the first week to 12325 in the last week. This spike in Pneumonia-related mortality, along with a general rise in the total number of deaths, suggests a growing burden on the healthcare system. The data indicates a concerning upward trend in both overall deaths and the proportion due to Pneumonia, necessitating potential public health interventions to address the surge. The recent escalation in mortality rates underscores the importance of vigilant surveillance and possible reinforcement of healthcare resources to manage the increased demand and prevent further mortality increases.
