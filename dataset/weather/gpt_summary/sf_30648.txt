Humidity levels varied significantly, starting at moderate levels, increasing during the night, then dropping sharply during the day, suggesting the presence of a weather system that passed through the area. Air pressure readings were somewhat unstable, with a notable pressure increase in the middle of the period, which could be indicative of transient atmospheric conditions such as a frontal passage.
