Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have experienced a typical diurnal cycle, starting off warm in the early hours, decreasing to cooler temperatures towards dawn, and then rising again to reach peak warmth in the late afternoon. Humidity levels have shown significant variation, with lower values at the start of the period, increasing to very high levels during the cooler early morning hours, and then decreasing as temperatures rose. Air pressure has fluctuated, with some periods of relative stability and others showing more significant changes, potentially indicating the passage of weather fronts or pressure systems. Wind speeds have been generally light to moderate, with some hours of calm conditions, while the wind direction has been variable, primarily coming from the south to the southwest, which is typical for Houston and may contribute to the transport of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. These combined weather indicators suggest a relatively stable weather pattern with no extreme weather events, but the high humidity levels could lead to discomfort for individuals outdoors during the warmer parts of the day.
