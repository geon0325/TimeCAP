Humidity levels fluctuated dramatically, with a period of saturation indicating the potential for fog or precipitation, followed by a significant decrease which could lead to drier conditions. Air pressure has been relatively stable but shows a slight downward trend, possibly signaling a change in the weather pattern such as the approach of a weather front.
