Humidity levels started relatively moderate, but saw an increase towards the morning, which is common as temperatures drop, and then decreased significantly towards the late afternoon and evening, indicating drier conditions as the day warmed up. Air pressure has been steadily increasing, suggesting a trend towards more stable and possibly clearer weather conditions. Wind speeds have been mostly light to moderate with some variability, but without any significant peaks that would suggest stormy conditions.
