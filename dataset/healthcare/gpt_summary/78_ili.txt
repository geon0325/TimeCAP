Over the last 20 weeks, the data reveals an increasing trend in the ratio of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) patients, indicating a growing incidence of ILI that has consistently risen above the baseline of 2.9%. The age distribution of ILI cases shows the highest increase among the youngest (0-4 years) and school-age (5-24 years) groups, which may suggest higher transmission rates in these demographics, potentially due to close contact in settings such as daycares and schools. Although the overall number of patients has fluctuated, there has been a significant peak in recent weeks, pointing to a possible surge in ILI cases. This increase in ILI activity could place additional strain on healthcare resources, necessitating the need for heightened surveillance, preventive measures, and possibly increasing vaccination outreach. Healthcare providers and public health officials should be prepared to address the potential impact on vulnerable populations, especially given the more pronounced rise in ILI cases among the elderly, who are at a higher risk for complications.
