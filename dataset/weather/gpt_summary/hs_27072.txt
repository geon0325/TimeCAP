Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before slightly declining towards the end of the period. Humidity levels showed a significant decrease through the day, suggesting the possibility of a drier and more comfortable environment following a very humid start. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight fluctuation, but a notable increase was observed towards the end of the period, which could indicate the approach of a high-pressure system, potentially leading to clearer skies. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate throughout the day, with an increase in the evening, which could contribute to a cooling effect despite the warm temperatures. The wind direction was variable but predominantly from a southerly direction, shifting slightly more towards the east at times, which is typical for Houston's weather patterns.
