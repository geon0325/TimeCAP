Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has displayed a typical diurnal pattern, with a gradual increase during the daylight hours followed by a decrease after sunset, which is expected given the city's geographic location and climate. Relative humidity remained consistently high, suggesting a significant amount of moisture in the air, which could lead to feelings of discomfort and the potential for fog formation, especially during the cooler night and early morning hours. Air pressure has been slowly decreasing, a trend that may indicate an approaching weather system that could bring changes such as precipitation or stronger winds. Speaking of winds, they have been light and variable in direction, not showing any significant gusts or sustained directional trends, which might contribute to a stable but potentially muggy weather situation. The wind direction has shifted more easterly to southerly over the period, which in Houston is often associated with warmer air being drawn in from the Gulf of Mexico.
