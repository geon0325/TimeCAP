Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable decline in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the highest recorded ratio of 9.89% in week 2 dropping to a low of 0.48% by week 20. The number of specimens tested remained high throughout the period, fluctuating between 52,169 and 84,708, indicating sustained surveillance efforts. Influenza A has been the predominant strain, with its positivity ratio decreasing from 9.85% to 0.42%, while Influenza B has remained a minor contributor, with its positivity ratio never exceeding 0.07%. The observed downward trend in influenza positivity suggests a current easing of the influenza burden on the healthcare system. However, continuous monitoring is essential as even low levels of influenza can have significant public health implications, particularly for vulnerable populations.
