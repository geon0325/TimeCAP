Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before starting to decline again. Humidity levels saw significant fluctuations, starting moderately high in the early hours, peaking during the night, and then decreasing notably towards the afternoon, suggesting the passing of a weather front or a change in air masses. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with a slight increase, indicating steady weather conditions and possibly the influence of a high-pressure system. Wind speed varied from calm to moderate, with the strongest winds occurring in the evening hours, and wind direction shifted significantly throughout the day, starting from northeasterly, turning to northerly, and then veering sharply to southerly by the end of the period. These variations in wind could be indicative of transitioning weather patterns, such as the approach or departure of a weather system affecting the city.
