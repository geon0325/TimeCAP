The analysis of the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data over the past 20 weeks reveals a consistent downward trend in the overall number of patients, although the most recent weeks show a slight increase. Throughout the period, the ratio of ILI patients remained well below the baseline of 2.9%, suggesting that influenza activity has been lower than the threshold considered to be of high concern. Despite the overall decrease in patient numbers, each age group experienced an increase in ILI cases in the last weeks of the period, with the youngest age group (0-4 years) and school-aged children and young adults (5-24 years) showing the most notable upticks. The sustained low ratio of ILI patients indicates that the healthcare system is not currently experiencing a significant burden from influenza. However, the recent increase in ILI cases across all age groups, particularly in the context of the overall rise in patient numbers, should be monitored as it may signal a change in the trend that could lead to higher demand on healthcare resources if continued.
