Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a fluctuating but generally declining trend in the positivity rate of specimens tested for influenza, with an overall average positivity of 6.26%. The number of specimens tested peaked at week 5, followed by a gradual decrease, suggesting a possible reduction in the number of individuals seeking testing. Influenza B has consistently shown a higher positivity rate compared to Influenza A, with its peak positivity at 0.21% in week 12, after which it exhibits a downward trend. The final week shows the lowest recorded positivity rates for both Influenza A and B at 0.04% and 0.05% respectively, which could indicate a waning influenza season or successful public health interventions. However, the healthcare system should remain vigilant as such trends could reverse or seasonal patterns may shift, warranting continued monitoring and potentially impacting resource allocation for testing and treatment.
