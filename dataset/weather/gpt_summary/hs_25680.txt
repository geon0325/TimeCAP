Over the last 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have seen a cyclical pattern, starting high, cooling during the early hours, and then rising again towards the latter part of the period. Humidity levels were significantly high through the night and early morning, reaching saturation, before dropping markedly during the day, which could have led to morning fog clearing into drier conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase towards the middle of the day, indicating steady weather conditions without the immediate likelihood of significant weather systems moving in. Wind speeds varied modestly throughout the period, with a couple of instances of increased wind activity that could have contributed to temporary changes in weather conditions. Wind direction showed variability, with shifts from southerly to northerly and back, suggesting the passage of localized weather fronts or the influence of sea breezes.
