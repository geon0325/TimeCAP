Humidity levels fluctuated slightly but remained predominantly high, suggesting a muggy atmosphere throughout the day with little relief. Air pressure experienced a gradual decline, which could indicate an approaching weather system or front that might bring changes in the weather pattern. Wind speeds varied, with some calmer periods, especially towards the end of the 24-hour period, where it was nearly still, while earlier there were more brisk conditions.
