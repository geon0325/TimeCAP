Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has exhibited a general upward trend, increasing from 3218.44 to 3431.28, suggesting a positive sentiment among investors. The VIX, which measures market volatility, has slightly decreased from 25.44 to 22.37, indicating that investors' fear and uncertainty have moderately subsided. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 have shown volatility with a mix of ups and downs, but both ended the period higher than they started, which could reflect growing investor confidence in both the Japanese and European markets. Gold Futures, typically a safe-haven asset, have experienced a decline from 1944.70 to 1927.70, potentially due to investors shifting towards riskier assets as market conditions improve. The slight fluctuations in the exchange rates for EUR/USD, USD/JPY, and USD/CNY indicate relative currency stability, with no drastic movements that could indicate heightened economic tensions or major shifts in international trade dynamics.
