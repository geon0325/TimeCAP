Over the past 24 hours in New York City, there has been a general trend of decreasing temperature, starting from a relatively warmer condition and gradually cooling down, particularly noticeable during the late-night to early-morning hours. Humidity levels exhibited significant fluctuations, with a notable spike towards high humidity in the early morning, potentially indicating the presence of morning fog or mist. Air pressure has been gradually decreasing, suggesting an increased likelihood of changing weather patterns or the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds varied, with calmer conditions around dawn and a steady increase through the day, becoming more brisk towards the evening. The predominant wind direction was southerly, shifting to a westerly and then northwesterly direction, which could bring cooler air and potentially clearer skies as the northerly winds often associate with the passage of a cold front.
