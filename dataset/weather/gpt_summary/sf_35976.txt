Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a noticeable decrease in temperature from the initial hours, followed by a gradual increase as the day progressed, peaking in the latter part of the timeframe, indicating a typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, starting at moderate levels, rising to high percentages during cooler hours, and then decreasing to lower levels towards the end of the period, suggesting a possible clearing of the air as temperatures rose. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with a slight downward trend toward the end, which could indicate a gradual change in weather patterns, possibly the approach of a minor weather system. Wind speeds were mostly light to gentle, with a period of stronger winds in the early hours, and the wind direction varied significantly, indicating a changeable and possibly unsettled local wind pattern. The combination of these factors suggests that San Francisco experienced typical coastal weather variability, with no immediate signs of severe weather conditions.
