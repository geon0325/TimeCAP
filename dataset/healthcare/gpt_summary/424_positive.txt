Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a peak of 18.27% in week 6 followed by a general decline to 7.55% by week 20. The ratio of Influenza A positive specimens has decreased from a high of 14.99% in week 6 to 4.03% in week 20, suggesting a tapering of Influenza A activity. In contrast, Influenza B showed an increase up to week 13 with a ratio of 6.93%, before declining to 3.52% in week 20. The overall decline in positive specimens for both Influenza A and B in recent weeks could indicate the tail end of the flu season, but healthcare systems should remain vigilant for potential surges. The data suggests that measures to control the spread of influenza should continue to be prioritized, including vaccinations and public health messaging, especially during the peak weeks identified.
