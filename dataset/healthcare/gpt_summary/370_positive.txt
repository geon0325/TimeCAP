The time-series data indicates a peak in influenza activity around weeks 4 and 5, where the percentage of positive specimens reached over 25%, with a predominance of Influenza A, which constituted the majority of positive cases at that time. However, since then, there has been a substantial decline in the ratio of positive specimens, dropping to below 1% in weeks 14 through 19, before a slight increase to 0.95% in week 20. Despite the overall decrease in influenza cases, there has been a slight uptick in the proportion of Influenza B cases relative to Influenza A, as evidenced by the increasing percentage of Influenza B from week 14 onwards, reaching 0.37% in week 20 compared to 0.58% for Influenza A. This shift in the viral subtype distribution could suggest evolving patterns in the circulating strains, potentially impacting vaccine effectiveness and requiring adjustments to public health strategies. The healthcare system can interpret the decline in overall influenza incidence as a positive sign, but it should remain vigilant for changes in strain predominance and be prepared to address a possible resurgence in cases or a shift in the predominant strain.
