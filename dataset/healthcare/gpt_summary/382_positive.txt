Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a general decline in the number of specimens tested for influenza, with an initial count of 97,168 specimens dropping to 35,938 by the end of the period. Despite fluctuations, the ratio of specimens testing positive for influenza has slightly decreased from 1.67% to 1.11%, indicating a mild downward trend in the prevalence of the virus. The data shows that Influenza B initially had a lower incidence than Influenza A but surpassed it in week 10, suggesting a shift in the dominant strain. However, in recent weeks, the positive rates for both Influenza A and B have converged, with Influenza A at 0.59% and Influenza B at 0.52% in the last week of reporting. This trend could influence the allocation of healthcare resources, as a balanced presence of both strains may require broad-spectrum antiviral stockpiling and diversified diagnostic capabilities.
