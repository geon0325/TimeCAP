Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a notable fluctuation in temperature, with a general increase during the day followed by a decrease at night, which is typical of the coastal climate influenced by ocean temperatures. Humidity levels experienced variations, starting lower, increasing significantly during the night and early morning hours, and then dropping sharply towards the late afternoon, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air transitioning to drier conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable with only minor fluctuations, indicating a steady weather pattern without the presence of significant frontal systems. Wind speeds began higher and gradually decreased throughout the day, becoming very light, which could contribute to the build-up of pollutants in the absence of stronger winds to disperse them. The wind direction was predominantly westerly, with some erratic shifts, which is common in coastal areas where local topography can influence wind patterns.
