Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature, demonstrating a dip during the earlier hours followed by a gradual increase and then stabilizing closer to the daily average. Humidity levels reached saturation in the early hours, which could have led to foggy conditions, but levels have decreased as the day progressed, indicating a drier atmosphere later on. Air pressure remained relatively stable and high throughout the period, suggesting settled weather without significant disturbances. Wind speeds were consistently light, which would not have contributed to any substantial wind chill effect, maintaining a relatively comfortable feel to the air. The wind direction shifted from southeasterly to northeasterly and then to easterly directions, which could have influenced the movement of air masses and potentially affected local weather patterns such as coastal breezes.
