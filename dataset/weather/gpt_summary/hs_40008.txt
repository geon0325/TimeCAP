Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, indicating a warming trend that peaked in the late afternoon hours. Concurrently, there has been a notable decrease in humidity, suggesting drier conditions setting in as the day progressed. Air pressure showed minor fluctuations but overall displayed a slight downward trend, which could be associated with changing weather patterns such as the approach of a weather system. Wind speed remained relatively constant with slight variations, while the wind direction shifted from southeasterly to southwesterly throughout the day, which might have contributed to the increase in temperature by bringing in warmer air from the inland. These combined factors indicate a possible shift in weather conditions that could affect local atmospheric stability and should be monitored for any subsequent changes.
