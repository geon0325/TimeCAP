Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the afternoon before slowly declining towards the evening. The relative humidity followed an inverse pattern to temperature, starting relatively low in the early hours, increasing significantly during the cooler morning, and then decreasing as temperatures rose through the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period but showed a slight decreasing trend towards the latter part of the day. Wind speeds were generally light and variable, with several hours of calm conditions, indicating a period of stable weather. The wind direction varied but predominantly came from the north, shifting slightly to the northeast by the end of the 24-hour period, which could suggest the influence of a high-pressure system moving through the area.
