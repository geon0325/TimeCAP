Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have shown a gradual increase with the warmest conditions occurring in the latter part of the day, indicative of typical daytime heating. Humidity levels exhibited significant variation, reaching their peak during the early morning hours, which is common due to nightly cooling, and then sharply decreasing as temperatures rose, suggesting a possible influence of daytime heating and mixing of the atmosphere. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, but a slight overall decrease was observed towards the end of the period, which could indicate a potential change in the weather pattern. Wind speeds varied, with calmer conditions in the early hours and a noticeable increase towards the evening, which could affect the dispersion of pollutants and influence local wind chill effects. The wind direction shifted from southerly to more westerly and northerly directions through the period, reflecting the passage of a weather system or a frontal boundary through the region.
