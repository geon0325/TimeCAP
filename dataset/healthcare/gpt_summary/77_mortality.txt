Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a fluctuating but overall increasing trend in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia when compared to the total number of deaths, starting at 5.66% and rising to 6.06%, peaking at 6.28% in week 18. This trend is above the reported average mortality ratio of 7.84%, suggesting a possible seasonal or other anomaly affecting these rates. The total number of deaths peaked in week 20 at 53,258, with a notable increase in deaths attributed to Influenza, which rose from 9 in week 1 to 45 in week 20. Pneumonia deaths also displayed an upward trend, culminating in week 18 with 3,279 deaths, despite a slight decrease in the last two weeks. This overall rise in Influenza and Pneumonia mortality requires close monitoring and potentially enhanced public health interventions to manage the impact on healthcare systems.
