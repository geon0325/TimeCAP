Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, transitioning from below freezing to moderately warmer conditions. Humidity levels showed a significant decrease throughout the day, starting at a moderately high level and plummeting to very low levels, which could indicate the presence of a dry air mass moving into the area. Air pressure has been on a general declining trend, suggesting the possibility of an approaching weather system that could lead to changing weather conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly towards the latter part of the period, with some gusty conditions observed, which could result in wind chill effects that make it feel colder than the actual temperature. The wind direction was variable but predominately from the north and northwest, which is typically associated with the transport of cooler air into the region.
