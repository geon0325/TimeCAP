Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable warming trend with temperatures increasing gradually, reaching a peak in the late afternoon before slightly declining again. The relative humidity was initially very high but decreased significantly as the temperature rose, which is a typical diurnal pattern. The air pressure remained relatively stable with only slight fluctuations, indicating steady atmospheric conditions without the immediate approach of a new weather system. Wind speeds varied moderately, with some increase during the day, which is common as the land heats up and creates pressure differentials. Wind direction was predominantly from the north, shifting slightly to the northwest and then back, suggesting the passage of a frontal system moving through the area that could have contributed to the observed temperature and humidity changes.
