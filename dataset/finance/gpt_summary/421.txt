Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has experienced volatility with a noticeable decline from 3580.84 to a low of 3236.92, before making a slight recovery to 3363.00, indicating a period of uncertainty in the US equity market. The VIX, commonly known as the "fear gauge," has fluctuated but remained elevated, peaking at 33.60 and closing recently at 26.37, which suggests that investor anxiety is persisting despite minor improvements. International markets have also faced instability; the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 both trended downwards with the FTSE 100 falling from a high of 6105.50 to 5866.10, reflecting broader global market concerns.

Commodity prices have been mixed, with Gold Futures retreating from a high of 1944.70 to 1887.50, a potential sign of investors liquidating safe-haven assets, while Crude Oil Futures have shown resilience, rebounding from a low of 36.76 to close at 40.22, possibly due to fluctuating demand and supply dynamics. Currency markets have seen the Euro and the Yen generally strengthening against the US Dollar, with EUR/USD moving from 1.19 to 1.17, and USD/JPY decreasing from 105.90 to 105.66, indicating shifts in currency strength that could impact international trade and investment flows.
