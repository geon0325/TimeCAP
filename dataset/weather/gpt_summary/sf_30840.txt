Humidity levels varied significantly, with several instances of complete saturation suggesting the presence of fog or mist, especially during the cooler early morning hours, which is common for this region. Air pressure saw a noticeable increase at one point, which could be associated with the movement of a high-pressure system into the area, potentially leading to clearer skies. Wind speed fluctuated moderately throughout the day, with a period of calm winds, which is often characteristic of the city's microclimates. The wind direction shifted across a broad spectrum, indicating the influence of variable coastal weather patterns and the passage of different air masses over the city.
