Over the last 24 hours in New York City, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature, with a warming trend observed after a period of colder temperatures earlier in the day. Humidity levels have varied but generally remained moderate to high, with a spike in the latter part of the day indicating increased moisture in the air. Air pressure has shown a gradual decrease throughout the day, suggesting a potential change in weather patterns, possibly leading to unsettled weather. Wind speeds have been light to gentle, with little to no wind observed at one point, but have remained mostly consistent towards the end of the period. The wind direction has shifted significantly from a predominantly northwesterly direction to a southeasterly direction, which could contribute to changes in temperature and moisture levels due to the differing air masses being brought into the area.
