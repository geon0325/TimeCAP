Over the last 24 hours, Houston experienced a significant range of temperature fluctuations with a distinct warming trend during the daytime, followed by a gradual cooling trend as the night progressed. Humidity levels showed considerable variability, starting relatively low but increasing dramatically overnight, which may have contributed to instances of early morning fog or dew. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable with a slight decreasing trend towards the end of the period, potentially indicating the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate and increased towards the end of the period, which could dispel humidity and lead to clearer conditions. The predominant wind direction was southerly to southeasterly, which is often associated with warm air advection in the region, contributing to the higher temperatures observed during the day.
