The VIX, which measures market volatility, has remained relatively stable, with minor fluctuations but no clear trend, suggesting that while there is some uncertainty, it has not significantly increased. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have shown resilience, with the Nikkei bouncing back after a dip and the FTSE 100 showing a slight overall increase, reflecting a divergence in performance across global markets.
