Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have fluctuated, showing a general decrease during the early hours, followed by a warming trend in the afternoon and a slight dip again towards the evening. Humidity levels experienced significant variation, with a notable peak that may indicate the presence of fog or heavy mist, which is typical for the region, before settling back to more moderate levels. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight increase in the late hours, suggesting stable weather conditions are likely to persist. Wind speeds were mostly gentle and consistent, with a brief period of calm conditions, and the predominant wind direction shifted from northerly to easterly and finally westerly, which is common due to the city's coastal geography. The combination of these weather indicators points to typical San Francisco weather patterns, with no extreme changes anticipated in the immediate future.
