Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, transitioning from warm conditions to cooler temperatures by the end of the period. Humidity levels were high, peaking at saturation during the night which could have led to foggy conditions, before decreasing slightly towards the evening of the following day. There was a significant drop in air pressure midday, suggesting the possible passage of a frontal system or other atmospheric disturbance, which could have led to changes in weather conditions such as storms or strong winds. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with some variability, but did not show any significant gusts that would indicate severe weather. The wind direction shifted throughout the day, predominantly coming from the south and swinging to the north, possibly due to the aforementioned frontal passage or other shifting weather patterns.
