Air pressure has remained relatively stable with a slight increasing trend, which often suggests steady weather patterns and possibly clearer skies. Wind speeds have varied moderately, with some hours experiencing calmer conditions and others slightly brisker winds, but without any extreme changes that would indicate severe weather events.
