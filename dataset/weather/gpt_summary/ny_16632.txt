Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, peaking in the late afternoon before starting to decline during the evening. The humidity levels showed a relative increase during the nighttime hours, which is typical due to the falling temperatures, but generally remained moderate throughout the period. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable with a slight decrease noted towards the end of the time period, suggesting stable weather conditions but a potential for minor changes ahead. Wind speeds were generally light and variable, with some increase in the evening, while wind direction showed significant variation, swinging from northeasterly to westerly and then shifting to predominantly southerly directions. This combination of light winds, moderate humidity, and stable pressure indicates that the city has enjoyed relatively calm weather conditions, but the slight pressure decrease may signal an approaching weather system.
