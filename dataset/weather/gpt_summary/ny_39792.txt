Over the past 24 hours in New York City, temperatures experienced a gradual decline from daytime warmth to cooler night conditions, a common diurnal pattern. Relative humidity levels showed notable variability, initially low but increasing significantly overnight, which could have implications for morning fog or dew. Air pressure steadily increased over the period, indicating a trend towards more stable weather conditions, possibly suggesting the approach or presence of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds varied, with some higher gusts, and predominantly came from a westerly direction, shifting between southwesterly and northwesterly, which may affect coastal areas and urban wind tunnels. The consistent wind direction coupled with increasing air pressure suggests that the weather is likely to remain clear and dry in the short term.
