Analysis of the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data over the past 20 weeks reveals a concerning upward trend in the percentage of ILI patients, surpassing the baseline threshold of 2.9% in recent weeks. The age group most significantly affected by ILI is the 5-24 demographic, showing a substantial increase in cases, which could imply a potential strain on schools, universities, and workplaces. The oldest age group, 65 and above, though not experiencing the same rate of increase, still shows a steady rise in ILI cases, indicating a potential risk for more severe outcomes and higher resource utilization in healthcare facilities. Additionally, the sharp rise in ILI percentages among all age groups, particularly in the last quarter of the observed period, could suggest increased transmission and may warrant enhanced public health interventions such as vaccination campaigns and health advisories. The healthcare system may face increased demand for medical care and resources, necessitating preparedness in terms of staffing, medical supplies, and hospital bed availability to manage the heightened ILI activity effectively.
