Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with a general downward trend, closing lower by 175.44 points from its initial value, indicating a cautious or bearish sentiment among investors. Correspondingly, the VIX, or Volatility Index, has risen overall, peaking at 28.33, which suggests increased market uncertainty. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 also demonstrated fluctuations, with the Nikkei experiencing a significant drop, especially in the latter days, while the FTSE 100 showed resilience with a slight upward trend despite recent dips. Gold Futures prices increased, indicative of a flight to safety among investors, as gold often serves as a hedge during times of market stress, closing 55.7 higher. Crude Oil Futures escalated to 95.46, reflecting a strong upward momentum possibly due to geopolitical tensions or supply concerns, while currency exchange rates remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations against the USD, signaling a steady forex market in the face of equity and commodity volatility.
