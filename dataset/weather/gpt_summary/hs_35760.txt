Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature, showing a significant warming trend during the day before cooling down again. Relative humidity levels started moderately, increased towards the morning, and then decreased as temperatures rose, suggesting a typical diurnal pattern. Air pressure remained relatively stable with only slight variations, indicating steady atmospheric conditions without the presence of strong weather fronts. Wind speeds were generally light but picked up in the afternoon, which could have contributed to the decrease in humidity by dispersing moisture in the air. The wind direction varied, predominantly coming from the southeast, shifting to northerly in the morning, and then settling from the southeast to south-southeast, consistent with sea breeze influences in coastal areas.
