Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a warming trend with temperatures peaking in the late afternoon, which is typical for the region's Mediterranean climate. Humidity levels have shown a slight decrease throughout the day, likely contributing to the comfort levels despite the warmer temperatures. Air pressure has seen a slow but steady decrease, suggesting a change in weather patterns that could potentially lead to instability in the upcoming period. Wind speeds have been moderate with a peak in the early evening, and the prevailing winds have been consistently westerly, which is characteristic of San Francisco's coastal location and could be responsible for the gradual increase in temperature as inland heat is carried towards the city. Overall, the city has experienced typical weather conditions for the season, but the drop in air pressure could indicate an approaching weather system.
