Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature exhibited a warming trend during the day, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before gradually cooling down. Relative humidity levels started at saturation but showed a significant decrease through the day, likely contributing to the sensation of increased warmth as temperatures peaked. Air pressure experienced a slight decrease overall, suggesting the potential for unstable weather conditions to develop. Wind speeds remained relatively light with some variability, while wind direction was predominantly from the south and shifted to westerly and northerly directions later in the period, which could be indicative of a frontal passage. The combination of these conditions suggests a typical pattern of diurnal variation possibly influenced by a passing weather system.
