Over the last 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have shown a gradual decrease, with a more noticeable drop during the later hours, indicative of the transition from day to night. Humidity levels maintained a relatively high average throughout the period, suggesting a persistently moist atmosphere that could have implications for cloud formation or fog development. Air pressure experienced a slight decreasing trend, which could be associated with the approach of a weather system that might result in changing weather patterns, such as increased cloudiness or a higher chance of precipitation. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with a period of calm winds, and the wind direction was variable, although predominantly from the south, shifting towards the west and briefly to the north, which could influence local temperature and humidity levels. The combination of these factors suggests that the weather in Houston has been relatively stable, but the observed pressure changes and wind shifts might signal an upcoming change in weather conditions.
