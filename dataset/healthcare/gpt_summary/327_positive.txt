Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a fluctuating trend in the ratio of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a peak positivity of 9.89% in week 14, surpassing the average ratio of 6.26%. The number of specimens tested has generally increased over the period, with a notable rise in weeks 15 through 20, suggesting an increased surveillance or possibly a response to a rising trend in influenza-like illness. Influenza A has been predominant, with its highest positivity rate at 9.85% in week 14, and consistently higher than Influenza B, which peaked at only 0.17% in week 12. The recent decline in both positivity rates for Influenza A and B to 5.74% and 0.05% respectively, in week 20, might indicate a tapering off of the influenza season. However, healthcare systems should remain vigilant as influenza patterns can be unpredictable, and a resurgence can occur, necessitating sustained testing and vaccination efforts.
