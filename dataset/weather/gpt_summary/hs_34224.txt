Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature reaching its peak in the late afternoon before starting to decline during the evening, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Concurrently, humidity levels were high throughout the majority of the day, which may have contributed to a muggy and uncomfortable feel for residents, especially when temperatures were at their highest. Air pressure showed minor fluctuations but was on a slight downward trend, potentially signaling a change in weather patterns or an approaching weather system. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate but experienced a noticeable spike toward the end of the period, which could suggest the onset of a more turbulent weather event. The wind direction varied but primarily came from an easterly direction before shifting significantly later on, possibly due to the same weather disturbances affecting wind speed.
