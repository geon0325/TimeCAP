Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable decline in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia when compared to the total number of deaths, with the percentage dropping from 18.92% to 6.78%. This downward trend suggests an improvement in the management and prevention of these respiratory conditions or a seasonal reduction in their prevalence. Despite the decrease in proportional mortality, Influenza deaths have not shown a consistent pattern, fluctuating between 5 and 34 weekly deaths, indicating the need for continuing surveillance and vaccination efforts. Pneumonia deaths have steadily decreased from 15,777 to 3,883, accounting for the significant contribution to the overall reduction in the mortality ratio. Healthcare systems may interpret this data as a positive indicator but should remain vigilant for potential resurgences, especially in the context of easing public health measures or the emergence of new respiratory pathogens.
