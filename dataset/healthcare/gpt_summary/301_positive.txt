Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant upward trend in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with an observed increase from a low of 0.06% to a peak of 1.84%. The number of specimens tested weekly increased steadily, peaking at 72,905 in week 19, while the number of positive specimens for Influenza A surged dramatically in the last two weeks, with a notable jump from 309 to 1285 positive cases. In contrast, the number of positive specimens for Influenza B remained relatively stable, with a slight increase but without dramatic spikes. The ratio of positive specimens for Influenza A notably exceeded that for Influenza B, particularly in the last week, where it reached 1.79% compared to 0.05% for Influenza B. These trends suggest a growing prevalence of Influenza A, which could potentially lead to increased hospitalizations and a strain on healthcare resources, necessitating preparedness and response planning by healthcare providers and public health officials.
