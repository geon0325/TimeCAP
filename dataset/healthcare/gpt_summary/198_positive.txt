Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable upward trend in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the overall ratio of positive specimens increasing from 2.38% to 11.66%. The data shows a more pronounced rise in Influenza B detections compared to Influenza A, with the former climbing from a 1.07% positivity rate to 8.25%, while Influenza A increased from 1.31% to 3.40%. The most significant jump occurred in the last six weeks, where the combined positivity rate escalated from 5.16% to 11.66%, suggesting an accelerating spread of influenza. This surge in flu cases could strain healthcare resources, indicating a potential need for increased vaccination efforts, public health messaging, and healthcare preparedness for a higher volume of patients. The disproportionate increase of Influenza B, which is known for causing more severe illness in children and the elderly, may also necessitate targeted healthcare strategies for these vulnerable populations.
