Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature, demonstrating a typical diurnal cycle with a peak during the daytime and a drop towards nighttime. Humidity levels were initially high and remained relatively elevated throughout the period, which could have contributed to a muggy and uncomfortable atmosphere, especially when temperatures were at their highest. Atmospheric pressure experienced a significant increase in the middle of the time series, suggesting the potential passage of a high-pressure system, which is often associated with more stable weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate and showed no significant peaks, indicating a relatively calm wind pattern. The wind direction varied throughout the day but predominantly came from the south to the southwest, which could have influenced the temperature and humidity levels due to the transport of warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico.
