Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant increase in the ratio of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the overall average being 6.26%. The data shows a rising trend in both Influenza A and B, with the ratio of positive specimens for Influenza A starting at 1.08% and peaking at 22.19%, while Influenza B started at 0.59% and reached a high of 8.47%. The most notable surge occurred in weeks 13 to 20, where the positivity rate for both types combined escalated from 10.75% to over 27%, indicative of a substantial influenza activity. This upsurge has led to an increased demand for healthcare services, as evidenced by the peak positivity rates aligning with the highest number of specimens tested (81,687 in week 20). The data suggests a critical need for healthcare providers to prepare for continued influenza cases and for public health initiatives to focus on prevention and control measures.
