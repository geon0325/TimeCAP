Over the last 20 weeks, the data reveals a declining trend in the positivity of respiratory specimens for both influenza A and B, with a notable decrease in the overall ratio of positive specimens from 19.03% to 1.81%. The ratios of positive tests for influenza A and B have both decreased, with influenza A dropping from 10.37% to 1.07% and influenza B from 10.56% to 0.74%. Despite a fluctuation in week 2 where influenza B positivity peaked at 10.56%, both subtypes have shown a consistent downtrend. The decline in positivity rates suggests a decreasing prevalence of influenza in the tested population, which could indicate a waning influenza season or the effectiveness of public health interventions. This trend could lead to a lower burden on healthcare resources dedicated to influenza, but continued surveillance is essential to detect any potential changes in the virus's activity or the emergence of new strains.
