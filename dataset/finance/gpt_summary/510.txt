Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown resilience with a gradual increase from 3799.61 to 3915.59, indicating a positive trend in the U.S. stock market. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, saw a significant spike to 37.21 but has since normalized closer to its 20-day low at 21.24, suggesting that investor anxiety has tempered after a bout of uncertainty. International equity markets mirrored this optimism with Japan's Nikkei 225 surging notably from 28139.03 to 29388.50, while the UK's FTSE 100 experienced moderate fluctuations before closing slightly higher at 6523.50. Commodity prices were mixed; Gold Futures receded from a high of 1865.90 to 1831.90, indicating a potential shift from safe-haven assets, while Crude Oil Futures climbed steadily from 52.25 to 57.97, reflecting expectations of strengthening demand. The currency markets have seen the Euro and the Japanese Yen depreciate against the U.S. dollar, with the EUR/USD pair moving from 1.22 to 1.20 and the USD/JPY pair rising from 104.09 to 105.40, signaling a stronger dollar in the foreign exchange market.
