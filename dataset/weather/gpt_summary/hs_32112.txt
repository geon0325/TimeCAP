Over the past day in Houston, temperatures steadily increased, peaking during the afternoon hours before gradually declining toward the evening. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, with very high levels in the early morning, which are characteristic of the high moisture content in the air typical for this region, followed by a significant drop in the late afternoon, suggesting a possible frontal passage or drier air moving into the area. Air pressure experienced a notable increase during the day, indicating the likely presence of a high-pressure system that could be responsible for clearer skies and stable weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with an increase observed later in the day, which could contribute to cooler evening temperatures if sustained. There was variability in wind direction, with a tendency to shift, which could signal changing weather patterns, such as the approach or departure of a weather system affecting the area.
