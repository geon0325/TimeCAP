Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant increase in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, rising from 1.99% to a peak of 26.24% before slightly decreasing to 26.07%. The majority of these positive specimens are attributable to Influenza A, which has seen its ratio increase from 1.54% to 25.25%, indicating a dominant strain this season. Influenza B has maintained a lower and relatively stable presence, with a slight increase in its ratio from 0.45% to 0.83%. The consistent upward trend in the overall positivity ratio suggests an escalating flu season, with a surge in cases that could strain healthcare resources. The high ratio of positive specimens for Influenza A underscores the importance of targeted public health interventions, including vaccination and antiviral treatments, to manage the spread and impact of this predominant strain.
