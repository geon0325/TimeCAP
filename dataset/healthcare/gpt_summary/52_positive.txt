Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a significant upward trend in both the number and ratio of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, indicating a substantial increase in flu activity. The ratio of positive specimens has risen from 1.57% in week 1 to 24.51% in week 20, with a marked increase observed from week 10 onwards. Influenza A has been the predominant strain, with its ratio of positive specimens climbing from 0.90% to 19.34% over the period, although Influenza B has also shown a notable increase in the latter weeks, with its ratio reaching 5.17%. The week-over-week increase in positive cases, particularly from weeks 10 to 20, suggests a heightened burden on healthcare resources due to the growing number of flu patients. This trend may necessitate increased healthcare preparedness, including flu vaccination drives, stockpiling of antiviral medications, and potential staffing adjustments to manage the surge in influenza cases.
