Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a fluctuating trend in the number of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases across different age groups, with a notable peak in ILI percentages that exceeded the baseline threshold mid-way through the period. The highest proportions of ILI cases were observed in the younger age groups, particularly in individuals aged 0-4 and 5-24, which could imply higher transmission rates or susceptibility within these demographics. After reaching a peak, the ILI percentage has since shown a consistent decline, currently sitting just below the baseline, suggesting a potential easing of the ILI spread. Despite the decrease, the healthcare system should remain vigilant, especially in pediatric and young adult populations, as these groups have exhibited the most significant burden of ILI. The overall trend towards a lower ratio of ILI patients is promising, but continued monitoring is essential to detect any changes in the pattern that could signal a resurgence.
