Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a volatile but overall upward trend, closing higher by 3.81% from 3511.93 to 3550.50, suggesting a positive sentiment among investors. However, the VIX, which measures market volatility, also increased during periods of market stress, peaking at 40.28 before declining to 25.75, indicating a return to more stable market conditions. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 indices experienced fluctuations; the Nikkei 225 ultimately gained 5.2%, reflecting strength in the Asian markets, while the FTSE 100 saw a significant jump in the last recorded session to close at 6186.30, up by 3.64% from the initial value, which may reflect market reactions to specific regional catalysts. Gold futures exhibited a downward trend, decreasing by 1.87%, which could suggest a shift in investor preference from safe-haven assets to riskier investments amid market recovery. Crude Oil Futures were notably volatile with a final uptick to 40.29, and currency exchange rates saw the Euro and Japanese Yen strengthening against the US Dollar, while the USD/CNY pair remained relatively stable, hinting at currency market sensitivities to broader economic movements and monetary policy expectations.
