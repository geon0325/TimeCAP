Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have shown a typical diurnal pattern, with a peak during the day followed by a gradual cooling towards the night. Humidity levels have fluctuated, with notably higher values during the cooler early morning hours, which suggests the presence of significant moisture in the air that could contribute to morning fog, a common occurrence in this region. Air pressure has been relatively stable but showed a slight decrease towards the end of the period, which could indicate an approaching weather system that may bring changes in the weather conditions. Wind speeds have been mostly light to moderate, with some increase in strength observed later in the period, which could help to clear out any fog or low-lying clouds. The wind direction has been variable, with a shift from northerly to westerly winds, which is consistent with the passage of a weather front and could lead to changes in temperature and humidity levels.
