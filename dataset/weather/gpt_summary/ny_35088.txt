Over the past 24 hours in New York City, there has been a gradual increase in temperature, peaking during the latter part of the day, which suggests a typical diurnal pattern with warmer conditions in the afternoon. Humidity levels started high in the early hours but showed a decreasing trend as the temperature rose, indicative of relative atmospheric dryness increasing towards the evening. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with minor fluctuations that are not indicative of significant weather changes such as the approach of a storm system. Wind speed was consistently light throughout the period, contributing to a calm weather scenario without significant wind chill effects or dispersion of airborne particles. The wind direction varied, with a notable shift from easterly directions to westerly and eventually to more northerly directions, which could influence the movement of weather systems and the transport of air masses into the region.
