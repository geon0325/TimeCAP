Over the last 20 weeks, there has been an upward trend in the ratio of deaths attributed to influenza or pneumonia, culminating in a percentage that significantly exceeds the 20-week average of 7.84%. The last two weeks have seen an especially sharp increase, with the ratio reaching 9.56% and 10.55%, respectively, suggesting a potential outbreak or increased virulence of these respiratory diseases. The absolute number of deaths from influenza spiked dramatically in week 19, with a more than tenfold increase from the previous week, which coincides with the overall rise in the mortality ratio. Pneumonia-related deaths have also been rising steadily, contributing to the growing concern for public health. This trend could indicate a strain on healthcare resources and may necessitate increased preventive measures, vaccination efforts, and allocation of medical care to manage the surge effectively.
