Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a decline in temperature, transitioning from mild conditions to cooler temperatures, indicative of a passing cold front or similar atmospheric event. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with notably higher values during the cooler early morning hours, suggesting the possibility of morning dew or fog formation. Air pressure saw a gradual increase through the period, reaching a peak before slightly receding, which is typically associated with the stabilization of weather conditions and the potential for clearer skies. Wind speeds remained generally light to moderate with some variability, and the wind direction shifted from northerly to easterly and then varied considerably, indicating a changing weather pattern. The combination of these factors points towards a dynamic weather situation in Houston, with the potential for a mix of clear skies and cooler temperatures following the recent passage of a frontal system.
