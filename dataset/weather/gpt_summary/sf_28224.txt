Over the past day, San Francisco experienced a slight temperature fluctuation with a general trend of gradual increase, followed by a drop toward the end of the observed period. Humidity levels were initially saturated but showed a decreasing trend, which might suggest the dissipation of fog or mist typically present in the area. Air pressure saw a gradual decline throughout the day, with some variability, indicating the potential for changing weather conditions, possibly the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds varied, with periods of calmer winds and a notable increase towards the latter part of the day, which, combined with shifting wind directions, could imply the arrival of a frontal system. The changes in wind direction from southerly to westerly and then to northerly suggest that San Francisco's weather was influenced by passing weather fronts and possibly local topographical effects.
