Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature, showing a typical diurnal pattern with a peak during the day and a cooling trend towards the night. Humidity levels experienced a wide range, from very high levels, potentially indicating fog or mist conditions, especially when the humidity reached saturation, to much lower values that would be associated with clearer skies. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight variation, suggesting stable weather patterns without the presence of significant frontal activity. Wind speed varied modestly with a couple of instances of increased velocities, which could have resulted in breezier conditions; however, these did not persist for long durations. The wind direction was variable, with a tendency towards southerly and westerly directions, which is typical for coastal regions like San Francisco and can influence the temperature and fog distribution along the bay.
