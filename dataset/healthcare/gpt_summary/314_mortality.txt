Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a general decline in the total number of deaths, with the initial figure of 66,337 dropping to 55,691. Concurrently, deaths from influenza have markedly decreased from 629 to 34, reflecting a downward trend in influenza-related mortality. Deaths from pneumonia have also exhibited a decrease, though less pronounced, from 5,189 to 3,251. The ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia to total deaths shows a fluctuating yet overall declining trend, starting at 8.77% and ending at 5.90%, which is below the 20-week average of 7.84%. This overall decline in both the number of deaths and the ratio of Influenza or Pneumonia mortality could suggest improved public health measures or seasonal patterns, but it may also necessitate continued monitoring to manage healthcare resources effectively.
