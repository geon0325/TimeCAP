Over the last 20 weeks, the data reveals a growing trend in the proportion of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases across all age groups, with a marked increase surpassing the 2.9% severity benchmark starting from week 11. The highest incidence of ILI is observed among the youngest (0-4 years) and school-aged children (5-24 years), suggesting a higher transmission rate within these demographics, which is not uncommon for influenza. The peak of ILI activity was reached between weeks 15 and 16, where the ratio of ILI patients reached and slightly exceeded 7%, indicating a significant strain on healthcare resources. Since then, a gradual decrease in the ILI percentage has been noted, yet the proportion of ILI cases remains well above the severity threshold at 6.14% in week 20. These trends may necessitate continued allocation of healthcare resources towards managing ILI cases, along with public health interventions to control the spread, especially in highly affected age groups.
