Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced relatively stable temperatures with a slight increase noted during the latter part of the time frame. Humidity levels remained extremely high for most of the day, although there was a gradual decrease towards the evening, indicating less moisture in the air. Air pressure showed a slow decreasing trend, which often suggests a potential for changing weather patterns, possibly leading to increased cloudiness or precipitation. Wind speeds picked up moderately in the evening, with a shift in wind direction from predominantly southeast to more westerly, reflecting a change in the weather system affecting the area. Overall, the combination of high humidity, decreasing air pressure, and shifting winds could suggest the approach of a weather front, with the possibility of precipitation and changes in temperature in the near term.
