Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual increase in temperature, indicating a warming trend that peaked in the late afternoon before entering a modest cooling phase toward the end of the period. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, with particularly high values during the night that could have contributed to a muggy feeling, but there were noticeable drops in the afternoon, possibly due to the increase in temperature. Air pressure slightly decreased overall, suggesting an increased possibility of changing weather patterns or the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds were mostly light and variable, with occasional calm conditions, indicating a relatively stable atmosphere without significant frontal activity. Wind direction varied widely throughout the period, with no dominant pattern, which could imply that no single weather system was exerting a strong influence on the area's wind patterns.
