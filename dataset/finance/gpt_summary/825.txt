Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has exhibited a downward trend, declining from 4412.53 to 3991.24, which indicates increased market bearishness. This is further supported by the rise in the VIX, a measure of market volatility, which increased from 24.37 to 34.75, suggesting heightened investor fear and uncertainty. Amidst this, the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 have also shown volatility, with the former ending on a notable drop to 26319.34 from its earlier position, and the latter declining sharply to 7216.60 from 7618.30, reflecting broader global market concerns.

Commodity prices have been mixed; Gold Futures saw a slight decrease from 1944.30 to 1857.10, indicating a potential shift in safe-haven asset preference, while Crude Oil Futures fluctuated but ended significantly lower at 103.09, possibly reflecting concerns over global economic growth. Currency markets have seen the USD strengthen against the JPY and CNY, ending at 130.75 and 6.67 respectively, while the EUR/USD exchange rate remained relatively more stable but still showed a slight depreciation of the Euro against the Dollar, moving from 1.09 to 1.05, which could signal shifting investor sentiment towards the strength of the US economy in comparison to others.
