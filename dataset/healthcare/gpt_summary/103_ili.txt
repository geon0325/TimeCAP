Over the past 20 weeks, the data indicates a fluctuating trend in the number of influenza-like illness (ILI) cases across different age groups, with an initial period of escalation followed by a gradual decline. The highest proportion of ILI cases was observed in the younger population, specifically those aged 5-24, which subsequently experienced a notable decrease. The elderly population, aged 65 and above, consistently showed the lowest number of ILI cases throughout the period, although this group is typically at higher risk for severe illness. Importantly, the ratio of ILI patients reached its peak in the middle of the observed period, significantly exceeding the baseline threshold for influenza activity, before decreasing to a level below the baseline towards the end of the period. This pattern suggests that while there was a period of heightened ILI activity that could have strained healthcare resources, the current trend shows a reduction in ILI cases, potentially easing the demand on healthcare services.
