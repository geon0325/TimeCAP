Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperature has experienced a diurnal cycle with a noticeable drop during the nighttime hours followed by a rise post-sunrise, indicative of clear skies or limited cloud cover which can create significant temperature swings. Humidity levels have shown considerable fluctuations, with a peak during the early morning hours typically associated with cooler temperatures and potential fog formation near the bay, followed by a sharp decrease during the day which suggests drier conditions. Air pressure has been relatively stable with a slight variation, except for a noticeable dip later in the period, which could indicate the approach of a weather system that could change current conditions. Wind speeds have been mostly light with occasional moderate gusts, and the wind direction has varied significantly throughout the day, which could disrupt any established weather patterns. The combination of the wind's variability, the sharp drop in humidity, and the pressure dip suggests an incoming change in weather that residents should be prepared for.
