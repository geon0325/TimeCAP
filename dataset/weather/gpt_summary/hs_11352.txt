Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced remarkably stable temperatures which have remained consistent throughout the time period. Humidity levels have also been consistent, indicating a high level of moisture in the air that could contribute to a muggy feeling for residents. Air pressure has shown a slight increase at the beginning of the time series, stabilizing thereafter, suggesting that the weather is likely under the influence of a high-pressure system that could mean fair weather conditions. Wind speeds have been light and constant, indicating a calm period with little variation in wind-related weather conditions. The wind direction has been predominantly from the northeast, which could influence the transport of air masses and potentially bring cooler air from that direction.
