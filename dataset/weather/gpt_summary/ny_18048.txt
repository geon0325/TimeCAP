Over the past 24 hours in New York City, temperatures have exhibited a gradual increasing trend, transitioning from cooler conditions in the early hours to notably warmer temperatures by the end of the period. Humidity levels have decreased as temperatures rose, suggesting an inverse relationship typical of diurnal patterns, with the air becoming drier as the day progressed. Air pressure remained relatively stable with only minor fluctuations, indicating a lack of significant weather fronts moving through the area that might drive more dramatic changes in weather conditions. Wind speeds varied but saw an increase towards the latter part of the period, which could contribute to a perception of cooler temperatures despite the actual air temperature increase. Wind direction was predominantly from the northwest, with occasional shifts, but maintained a general consistency that suggests a steady weather pattern over the city.
