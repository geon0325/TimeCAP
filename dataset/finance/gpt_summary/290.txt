Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has experienced significant volatility, with an overall downward trend from 2978.76 to 2475.56, reflecting investor uncertainty amid prevailing market conditions. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, has remained elevated, peaking at 82.69, indicating high levels of market stress. International indices like the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 have also faced steep declines, though the Nikkei 225 showed some recovery towards the end, suggesting a possible stabilization in Asian markets. Safe-haven assets like Gold Futures saw a price increase from 1640.00 to 1632.30, despite some fluctuations, underscoring investors' risk aversion. Exchange rates have shown the US dollar strengthening against the euro and the Japanese yen, but slightly weakening against the Chinese yuan, which could indicate shifting investor confidence towards the stability of the US economy relative to others.
