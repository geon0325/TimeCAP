The Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data over the last 20 weeks indicates a downward trend in the ratio of ILI patients, with the latest figures falling below the baseline threshold of 2.9%. This trend is observed across all age groups, with the most significant decrease noted within the youngest population (ages 0-4), followed by the 5-24 age group, suggesting a reduction in ILI incidence among children and young adults. The age groups 25-49 and 50-64 also exhibit a decrease in ILI cases, albeit at a slower rate. Notably, the elderly population (age 65 and above), while accounting for fewer cases, shows a consistent presence of ILI, which could indicate higher susceptibility or more severe implications for this demographic. These trends suggest that overall ILI activity is declining, which may lead to decreased pressure on healthcare resources; however, ongoing monitoring and targeted healthcare strategies for the most vulnerable groups remain crucial.
