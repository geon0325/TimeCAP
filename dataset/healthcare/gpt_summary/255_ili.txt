Over the last 20 weeks, the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data indicate a fluctuating but overall significant burden on the healthcare system, with reported ILI ratios consistently above the baseline of 2.9%. The highest ratio of ILI patients was seen in the middle of the observed period, suggesting a peak in ILI cases that coincided with a period of elevated patient numbers in all age categories, particularly among the younger and middle-aged cohorts. Following this peak, there has been a gradual decline in the ILI patient ratio, yet the numbers remain above baseline, indicating sustained ILI activity. The age groups 0-4 and 5-24 years have been the most affected, which could imply a higher transmission rate among children and young adults, possibly affecting schools and workplaces. The persistently high ILI ratios throughout the period suggest that healthcare resources may have been stretched, necessitating continued monitoring and possibly increased healthcare provisioning for effective response to ILI cases.
