Over the last 24 hours in New York City, temperatures have experienced a slight fluctuation with mild cooling and warming cycles, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels have shown significant variation, reaching saturation at certain times, suggesting the possibility of fog or precipitation during these peak periods. Air pressure has been gradually decreasing, which could signal an approaching weather system that may bring changes such as increased cloudiness or the potential for rain.
