Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable increase in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the ratio of positive specimens rising from 1.84% to 9.50%. This trend is primarily driven by a surge in Influenza A detections, which escalated from 1.79% to 9.45% of tested specimens, while Influenza B remained relatively stable with minimal fluctuations around 0.05%. The peak testing volume occurred in week 6 with 147,040 tests conducted, yet the positivity rate for that week was below the average at 4.21%, indicating that increased testing does not necessarily correlate with a higher positivity rate. Weeks 18 to 20 marked the most significant spike in positive test rates, exceeding 8% and culminating at 9.50%, suggesting a growing prevalence of the virus. This upward trend in influenza activity could strain healthcare resources and necessitates increased vigilance in public health measures to mitigate the spread of the disease.
