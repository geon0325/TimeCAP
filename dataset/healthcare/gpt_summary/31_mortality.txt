Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a gradual increase in the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, starting at 5.43% and peaking at 6.83% in the penultimate week before a slight decrease to 6.75%. Despite fluctuations, the overall trend shows that the proportional mortality from these respiratory diseases has been consistently above the 20-week average of 7.84%. Notably, deaths from influenza saw a significant jump in the last week, rising from 46 to 92 deaths, which could indicate a sudden outbreak or increased virulence. Pneumonia deaths also rose over the period, from 2723 to 3739 deaths, suggesting a persistent burden on healthcare resources. This observed trend warrants close monitoring and potentially increased healthcare interventions to manage and mitigate the impact of respiratory diseases on the population.
