Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a significant fluctuation in the rate of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the ratio peaking at 26.27% in week 16 before declining to 8.61% by week 20. The number of positive specimens for Influenza A notably increased from week 1 to week 15, reaching a maximum of 48,835 cases, which reflects the major contribution of Influenza A to the overall rise in positive influenza cases during this period. In contrast, Influenza B has maintained a relatively stable and minor presence throughout the 20 weeks, with its ratio to positive specimens remaining below 0.13%. The highest overall percentage of positive specimens occurred in week 16, coinciding with a peak in the ratio of Influenza A cases, suggesting that the healthcare system may have experienced heightened pressure at this time due to increased demand for medical attention and resources. The recent downtrend in positive cases suggests a possible easing of the influenza burden on the healthcare system, but continuous surveillance is essential to manage resources effectively and prepare for potential future increases.
