Over the past 20 weeks, the data indicates a gradual decline in the overall number of patients presenting with Influenza-like Illness (ILI), followed by a significant surge in the most recent weeks. This increase is observed across all age groups, with the youngest (0-4 years) and school-age children (5-24 years) showing the most pronounced rise in ILI cases, which could suggest higher transmission rates among these populations. Despite the rise in case numbers, the ratio of ILI patients remains well below the baseline threshold of 2.9%, indicating that the ILI activity is not at a level typically associated with an influenza epidemic. However, the consistent upward trend in the ratio of ILI patients in recent weeks warrants close monitoring as it may signal the onset of a more widespread outbreak. Healthcare systems should be prepared for a potential increase in demand for medical services, especially in pediatric care, and consider reinforcing preventive measures such as vaccination and public education on illness prevention strategies.
