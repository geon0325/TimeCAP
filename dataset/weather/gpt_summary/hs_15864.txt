Over the past 24 hours in Houston, we observed a gradual increase in temperature reaching its peak in the late afternoon before starting to decline towards the evening. Humidity levels showed a significant drop during the afternoon hours, corresponding with the peak in temperatures, suggesting the typical diurnal pattern of lower humidity during the warmest part of the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight decrease noted later in the day, which could be indicative of a changing weather system approaching the area. Wind speeds were generally light with some variability, but there was a notable shift in wind direction from predominantly southeasterly to a more variable pattern, including periods of calm winds. This shift in wind direction, coupled with the late-day drop in air pressure, might suggest the potential for developing weather activity in the region.
