Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a general decline in the ratio of mortality due to Influenza or Pneumonia compared to total deaths, starting from above the 20-week average at 8.26% and ending at 6.11%, which is below the average of 7.84%. Despite fluctuations, the number of deaths from Influenza peaked in week 4, with 545 deaths, and then showed a steady decrease to 17 deaths in the last week. Pneumonia-related deaths have also decreased from 4427 in the first week to 3127 in the final week. This downward trend in the ratio and the actual number of deaths from Influenza or Pneumonia may indicate an improvement in the control or treatment of these conditions. However, the healthcare system should remain vigilant, as seasonal variations or emerging strains could potentially reverse this trend.
