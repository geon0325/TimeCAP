The data indicates a rising trend in the proportion of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases over the past 20 weeks, with the ratio of ILI patients increasing from 1.81% to a peak of 7.37% before declining to 4.08% in the most recent week. The benchmark of 2.9% was surpassed consistently from week 9 onwards, suggesting a significant period of heightened ILI activity which could strain healthcare resources. Age groups 0-4 and 5-24 years showed the most notable surge in ILI cases, with the peak values for these groups occurring concurrently with the overall peak ILI ratio. The highest absolute increase in ILI cases was observed among the 5-24 age group, indicating this demographic might have been a key driver of the epidemic curve. The recent decline in the ILI ratio to 4.08% suggests a possible easing of the ILI situation; however, healthcare systems should remain vigilant as the rate remains above the benchmark level.
