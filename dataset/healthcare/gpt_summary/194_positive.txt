Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable increase in the ratio of positive respiratory specimens for both Influenza A and B, with a significant rise in the last week reaching a high of 5.16%, surpassing the average of 6.26%. Influenza B has shown a particularly steep increase in the ratio of positive specimens, surging to 3.73% in the final week, which is a considerable escalation compared to its earlier weekly ratios. The number of specimens tested has also increased over the 20-week period, peaking at 28,842 in the last week, indicating heightened surveillance and possibly increased incidence of the flu. The week-to-week fluctuations in the positive ratios for Influenza A and B suggest variable transmission rates, with Influenza B recently taking a more dominant role in the number of infections. This upward trend in flu positivity rates could signal a growing burden on healthcare resources and underscores the necessity for heightened preparedness in the healthcare system to manage potential increases in patient volume.
