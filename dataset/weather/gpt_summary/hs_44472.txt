Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced a noticeable diurnal temperature variation, with the lowest temperatures recorded during the early morning hours and a significant warming trend peaking in the late afternoon. Humidity levels have shown considerable fluctuation, with a marked increase during the night that sharply dropped towards the midday hours, indicating drier conditions as the day progressed. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable, with only a slight downward trend suggesting a gradual weakening of the high-pressure system over the area. Wind conditions were predominantly light and showed a shift from northerly directions in the early hours to a more variable pattern later in the day, including a brief period of calm winds. These changes in wind direction and speed, combined with the observed pressure and humidity trends, could be indicative of a transitioning weather system affecting Houston.
