Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a marked decline in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the ratio of positive specimens decreasing from a peak of 26.13% in week 3 to 2.02% in the most recent week. The absolute number of tests conducted also decreased significantly from 53,364 in week 3 to 9,075 in week 20, possibly due to a decrease in the incidence of respiratory illnesses or a reduction in testing as the flu season wanes. Influenza A has consistently been the predominant type, but its incidence has dropped from a high of 25.25% of specimens tested in week 1 to 1.12% in week 20, while Influenza B has always been less prevalent, peaking at 1.79% and falling to 0.89% in the same period. The overall decline in influenza positivity rates suggests a subsiding flu season but continuous monitoring is necessary to detect any potential changes in the trend. The reduction in flu cases could alleviate some of the seasonal strain on healthcare resources, allowing for a reallocation towards other areas in need.
