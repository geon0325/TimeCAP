Over the past 24 hours in New York City, there has been a gradual decline in temperature, indicating a cooling trend. The humidity levels have seen some fluctuations but generally increased during the latter half of the period, which could lead to a feeling of increased chilliness or potential for fog development. Air pressure has been rising steadily, suggesting the establishment of a high-pressure system which typically brings clearer and more stable weather conditions. Wind speeds have varied, with a period of stronger winds followed by a significant decrease toward the end of the period, which could result in calmer conditions. The wind has been predominantly coming from the west-northwest, shifting slightly throughout the day, and becoming variable and very light by the end of the period, which might affect local temperatures and the dispersal of any precipitation or air pollutants.
