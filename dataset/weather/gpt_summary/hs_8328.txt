Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have fluctuated, experiencing a gradual increase towards the late afternoon, indicative of typical diurnal warming, followed by a decrease as night approached, before slightly rising again. Humidity levels showed considerable variation, with particularly high humidity in the early hours, likely contributing to a muggy or overcast start to the day, then decreasing during the day, which is consistent with the increase in temperature. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting a steady atmospheric condition without the immediate approach of a significant weather front. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with some variability but no strong wind events, indicating a relatively calm wind pattern for the area. Wind direction shifted significantly throughout the day, starting from a southeasterly direction, veering to northerly and easterly, and then steadying from an easterly direction, which may have influenced local temperature and humidity patterns due to varying air masses.
