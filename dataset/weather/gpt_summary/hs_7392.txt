Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a general increase in temperature, reaching a peak during the late afternoon before a gradual decline ensued towards the evening. Humidity levels have shown a significant decrease as the temperature rose, suggesting the presence of warmer, drier air moving into the area. Air pressure experienced a slight fluctuation but has been on a downward trend in the latter part of the period, which could indicate an approaching weather system. Wind speeds were relatively light and variable throughout the day, with a slight increase in the later hours, possibly as a result of changing weather patterns. The wind direction was predominantly southerly to southwesterly, which is typical for bringing warmer air to Houston, contributing to the higher temperatures observed.
