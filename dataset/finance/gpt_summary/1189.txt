Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with a general downward trend, declining from 4320.06 to 4278.00, indicative of investor uncertainty in the equity markets. The VIX, or Volatility Index, has increased from 17.20 to 21.40, which supports the observed equity market volatility and suggests heightened market risk perceptions. International market indicators like Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 also reflect a downward trajectory, with the Nikkei 225 dropping significantly from 32402.41 to 31430.62, and the FTSE 100 decreasing from 7683.90 to 7499.50, pointing towards a global apprehension in equity markets.

In contrast, safe-haven assets such as Gold Futures have appreciated from 1925.40 to 1968.40, which could signal a shift in investor sentiment towards risk aversion. The currency markets have seen minor fluctuations with the EUR/USD and USD/JYP exchange rates oscillating within a narrow band, while the USD/CNY remained relatively stable, suggesting that currency traders may be adopting a wait-and-see approach amid global market uncertainties.
