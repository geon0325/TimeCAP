Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a slight fluctuation in temperature with a general cooling trend leading into the night followed by a gradual warming towards the latter part of the observed period. Humidity levels have seen a significant increase overnight, reaching saturation at several points, which could have implications for fog development in the area, especially with the presence of stable high-pressure conditions. Atmospheric pressure has remained relatively stable, with a minor increase, suggesting steady weather patterns and potentially prolonged current conditions. Wind speeds have been consistently light with almost negligible variation, which, when combined with high humidity and stable pressure, may lead to reduced dispersion of air pollutants and thus a potential decrease in air quality. The wind direction has varied significantly, indicating a shift in local wind patterns, which could influence coastal and maritime activities.
