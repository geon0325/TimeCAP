Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual decline in temperature, reaching its lowest point during the early morning hours before rising again towards the late afternoon, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels have seen significant fluctuations, with a peak at 100% coinciding with the lowest temperatures, suggesting possible early morning fog conditions, which then cleared as humidity levels dropped sharply. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight dip during the middle of the day before returning to higher levels by the end of the period, which could signal a transient weather system passing through the area. Wind speeds varied moderately, with some higher gusts occurring sporadically, while wind direction showed notable variability, shifting from predominantly northwesterly to easterly and back over the course of the day, reflecting changing weather patterns. Overall, these indicators suggest that San Francisco's weather has been dynamic but without extreme conditions, with the usual coastal city patterns of fog and wind.
