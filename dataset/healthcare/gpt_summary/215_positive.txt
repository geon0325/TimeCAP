The time-series data indicates a marked seasonality in influenza activity, with a peak ratio of positive specimens reaching 30.26% in the middle of the reporting period, followed by a substantial decline to 1.03% by the last week. Influenza A has been the dominant subtype, with its highest percentage of positive specimens at 19.31%, before decreasing to 0.64% in the latest data, suggesting a significant reduction in its prevalence. Conversely, Influenza B showed a similar trend but with a slightly lower peak percentage of 17.59%, and also experienced a decline, albeit to a lesser extent, with the last week showing 0.40% positivity. The initial surge in positive specimens could have strained healthcare resources, but the recent downtrend signals a potential easing of the burden on the healthcare system. It's important to continue monitoring these trends as they inform public health interventions and guide the allocation of healthcare resources for managing influenza outbreaks.
