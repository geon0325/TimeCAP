Over the past 20 weeks, the data indicates a gradual decrease in the overall number of patients presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI) before witnessing a recent uptick. Despite fluctuations, the proportion of ILI patients among the youngest age group (0-4 years) remained the highest compared to other age groups, signaling a greater susceptibility or exposure risk in this demographic. The ILI ratio among patients has remained consistently below the baseline of 2.9%, suggesting that ILI rates have not reached levels typically associated with heightened concern. However, there has been a slight increase in the ILI ratio in recent weeks, pointing towards a potential early signal of an upward trend that warrants close monitoring. This increasing trend, particularly if sustained or amplified, could place additional strain on healthcare resources and necessitate preparedness measures to handle a possible surge in ILI cases.
