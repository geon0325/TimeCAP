Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a gradual increase in temperature indicating a slight warming trend throughout the day. Humidity levels remained high, particularly during the night and early morning hours, with a peak at full saturation, suggesting the likelihood of fog or mist formation that could have reduced visibility. The air pressure was relatively stable but showed a subtle increasing trend before slightly declining, pointing to stable weather conditions with little change expected shortly. Wind speeds were mostly light to gentle and showed little variation, indicating a calm wind pattern that is typical for the region. The wind direction shifted gradually from a westerly to a northwesterly direction, which is common along the coast and may have contributed to the slight uptick in temperature observed.
