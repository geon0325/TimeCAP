Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature experienced a significant fluctuation with a noticeable increase during the daytime followed by a gradual decrease towards the night, typical of the diurnal cycle. Humidity levels also varied considerably, with the highest values occurring pre-dawn and late evening, which could have led to a sense of increased mugginess during these times. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, indicating a sustained weather pattern without the immediate influence of strong frontal systems. Wind speeds were predominantly light, suggesting calm weather conditions, but there were subtle shifts in wind direction, including a notable change to a westerly direction for a brief period which could have affected local temperature and humidity levels transiently. Overall, these indicators suggest stable weather conditions with typical variations associated with the diurnal temperature cycle and localized changes in wind patterns that have a temporary impact on the weather in Houston.
