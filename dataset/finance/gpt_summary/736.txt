Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a general upward trend, closing higher at 4778.73 from an initial value of 4577.10, suggesting a positive sentiment in the U.S. equity market. The VIX, which measures market volatility, has decreased overall from 27.95 to 17.33, indicating a reduction in investor fear and market uncertainty. International indices, such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100, have also exhibited an uptrend, with the Nikkei closing at 28791.71 after an initial dip, and the FTSE 100 reaching 7403.00, reflecting global market strength. Gold futures have remained relatively stable with slight volatility, ending slightly higher at 1812.70, which could suggest investors are maintaining a hedge against potential market instability. Crude oil futures have seen a consistent increase from 66.50 to 76.99, which may have implications for inflation and economic growth, while currency markets indicate a modest depreciation of the USD against the EUR and JPY, with the EUR/USD pair moving to 1.14 and the USD/JPY to 114.95, but the USD/CNY pair has remained stable at 6.37.
