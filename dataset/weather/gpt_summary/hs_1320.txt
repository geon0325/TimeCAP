Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have experienced a gradual increase from cooler conditions in the early hours to warmer temperatures by the afternoon, before slightly cooling down again toward the end of the period. Humidity levels have shown fluctuations with higher values during the night and early morning, decreasing in the afternoon, which is typical as temperatures rise, and then increasing again in the later hours. Air pressure has been relatively stable but showed a slight decreasing trend, which could indicate the approach of a weather system or front. Wind speeds have been mostly calm, with a slight increase during the latter part of the day, and wind directions have varied, with more variability and a notable shift in the later hours, suggesting changing weather patterns. Overall, these conditions point to stable weather with a potential for changing patterns due to the slight pressure drop and increased wind speeds and variability in the latter part of the period.
