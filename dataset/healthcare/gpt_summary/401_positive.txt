Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable increase in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the total ratio of positive specimens growing from 1.11% in week 1 to 1.81% in week 20. This upward trend is observed for both Influenza A and B, with the positive ratios for Influenza A rising from 0.59% to 1.25%, and for Influenza B from 0.52% to 0.57% over the same period. The increasing ratios indicate a growing prevalence of influenza in the tested population, despite fluctuations in the number of specimens tested weekly. The growth in positive cases for Influenza A is particularly significant, as it shows a more than two-fold increase and outpaces the growth of Influenza B positives. This trend suggests a potential strain on healthcare resources and highlights the need for increased vigilance in influenza prevention and treatment measures.
