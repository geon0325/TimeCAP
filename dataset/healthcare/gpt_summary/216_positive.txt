Over the last 20 weeks, the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza has shown a significant fluctuation, peaking at 30.26% in week 11 before a steep decline to 0.62% by week 20. The prevalence of Influenza A showed a pronounced increase up until week 13, with a peak ratio of positive specimens at 19.50%, followed by a rapid decrease to 0.38% by the final week. Influenza B followed a similar trend, peaking at 17.59% positive specimens by week 5 and then declining to 0.24% by week 20. The overall ratio of positive specimens has recently fallen well below the 20-week average of 6.26%, indicating a possible waning of the influenza season. These trends suggest a significant decrease in influenza circulation, which could lead to a reduction in healthcare burden, but continuous monitoring is essential to manage potential future outbreaks.
