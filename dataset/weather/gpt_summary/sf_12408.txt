Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have seen a slight fluctuation, showcasing a cooling trend during the early hours followed by a gradual warming trend towards the latter part of the day. Humidity levels have remained relatively high throughout the period, with a noticeable drop in the later hours, indicating less moisture in the air. Air pressure remained stable for the majority of the day but experienced a significant drop more recently, which could signal an approaching change in weather patterns, possibly leading to increased wind activity or precipitation. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate but have increased towards the current hour, coupled with a shift in wind direction to a more northerly component. This combination of dropping air pressure and changing wind patterns suggests the possibility of unsettled weather, potentially bringing cooler temperatures and increased chances of rain or wind-driven events.
