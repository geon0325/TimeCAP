Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable decline in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, starting at 6.64% and decreasing to 5.14%, which remains below the 20-week average of 7.84%. The number of deaths attributed to influenza has significantly decreased from 202 to 13, indicating a possible reduction in influenza activity or effective management of the disease. Despite this, deaths from pneumonia have shown a less pronounced decline, from 3414 to 2618, suggesting pneumonia remains a consistent health concern. The overall trend of a decreasing ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia to total deaths could signal improvements in public health measures, vaccination rates, or treatment protocols. However, the healthcare system must continue to monitor these trends closely, as pneumonia still accounts for a substantial proportion of deaths and could indicate underlying vulnerabilities in population health or healthcare delivery.
