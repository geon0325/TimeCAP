Over the past 20 weeks, the data reveals a consistent decline in the percentage of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases relative to the total number of patients, with an initial high of 7.37% in the first week to a low of 2.21% in the last week. This suggests that the prevalence of ILI within the healthcare system has been decreasing over the observed period. Notably, the proportion of ILI cases has been above the 2.9% benchmark for the first 14 weeks, potentially indicating a period of increased stress on healthcare resources during that time. The most significant decreases in ILI cases have been observed in the 0-4 and 5-24 age groups, which could imply a reduction in transmission among these age groups that often act as primary vectors for the spread of influenza. As the percentage of ILI cases now falls below the benchmark, this may signal a relative easing of the healthcare burden associated with ILI, allowing for the reallocation of resources to other areas of need.
