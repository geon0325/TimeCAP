Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable decline in the ratio of mortality due to Influenza or Pneumonia when compared to the total number of deaths, with the percentage decreasing from 7.37% to 5.36%. This decline suggests an improvement in the control or treatment of these respiratory diseases or a change in the pattern of overall mortality causes. Despite the overall trend, the actual number of deaths attributed to Influenza has significantly decreased from 516 to 11 deaths per week, indicating a substantial reduction in Influenza-related mortality. Pneumonia deaths have also decreased from 3758 to 2770, but not as dramatically as Influenza, suggesting that Pneumonia remains a more consistent contributor to mortality in the analyzed period. This data could inform healthcare providers and policymakers to adjust resource allocation and continue to monitor and address the factors contributing to Pneumonia-related deaths, as well as to investigate the reasons behind the decrease in Influenza fatalities.
