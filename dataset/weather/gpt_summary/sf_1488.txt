Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperature has seen minor fluctuations, maintaining a relatively stable range which suggests consistent weather conditions without any extreme changes. Humidity levels have varied, with higher peaks during certain hours, implying the presence of more moisture in the air that could have led to a feeling of mugginess or potential fog development, especially during the night and early morning hours. The air pressure has shown a gradual decrease over time, potentially indicating an approaching weather system that could alter current conditions. Wind speeds have been moderate with some gusty intervals, and the wind direction has shifted, starting from a southerly direction and moving towards a more westerly direction by the end of the period, which could influence coastal conditions and potentially bring in cooler ocean air. The combination of these factors suggests that while the weather has been relatively stable, there is potential for changes that could influence the local climate, including possible coastal fog, changes in temperature, or the arrival of a new weather system.
