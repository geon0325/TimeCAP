The VIX, a measure of market volatility, has generally trended downwards from 15.96 to 15.28, aligning with the slight gain in the S&P 500 and indicating reduced investor anxiety. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 have experienced fluctuations, with the Nikkei closing slightly lower than its starting point and the FTSE showing a minor decline, which may reflect regional market uncertainties.

Commodity prices have diverged, with Gold Futures rising from 1274.50 to 1340.10, indicating a flight to safety among investors, while Crude Oil Futures have decreased sharply from 62.76 to 52.51, which could be a response to concerns over global economic growth. The foreign exchange markets have seen the Euro and Japanese Yen strengthen against the US Dollar, with EUR/USD moving from 1.12 to 1.13 and USD/JPY decreasing from 109.87 to 108.32, which may suggest a shift in currency market dynamics and potentially impact international trade and investment flows.
