Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have exhibited a diurnal pattern, starting off cooler in the early hours, peaking in the mid-afternoon, and then gradually declining towards the evening. Humidity levels showed variations, generally high but with noticeable drops at certain points, indicative of changes in moisture that could affect the comfort levels. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout most of the day, with a significant increase in the last recorded hour, suggesting a potential change in weather conditions, such as the arrival of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with a slight uptick later in the day, while the wind direction was predominantly from the south-southeast, which is typical for Houston and can contribute to bringing in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico.
