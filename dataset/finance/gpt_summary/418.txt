Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with an overall downward trend, declining from 3508.01 to 3298.46, which may indicate investor uncertainty in the equity markets. This is mirrored in the VIX, which has mostly remained elevated, averaging around 27, signaling increased market volatility and risk aversion. Internationally, the Nikkei 225 has remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, while the FTSE 100 experienced a significant drop mid-period but has since recovered somewhat, reflecting regional economic sentiments and possibly Brexit-related concerns. Gold and Crude Oil futures have both seen declines, with Gold decreasing from 1964.60 to 1857.70, and Crude Oil from 42.97 to 40.25, indicating a shift away from risk assets and potential worries about global demand. Lastly, the exchange rates show a slight weakening of the USD against the EUR and JPY, while holding relatively steady against the CNY, which may reflect changing perceptions of the US dollar's safe-haven status and shifts in trade dynamics.
