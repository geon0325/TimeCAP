Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a fluctuating trend in the incidence of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) across all age groups, with a noticeable peak that surpasses the baseline threshold for ILI ratio. The highest rates of ILI are observed among the youngest (0-4 years) and school-aged children (5-24 years), suggesting that these populations are the most affected and may serve as primary transmitters of the illness. Despite a rise in ILI cases to a level above the baseline, there has been a subsequent decline in recent weeks, potentially signaling a downward trend or a nearing end to the peak ILI season. The sustained high numbers among older adults (65 years or more) raise concerns for this vulnerable group, who are at increased risk of complications from ILI. Healthcare systems should remain vigilant and continue to monitor these trends closely, as the decline in ILI rates should not lead to complacency given the potential for rapid changes in ILI activity and its impact on healthcare resources.
