Over the last 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable decrease in temperature from the day's peak to the night's cooler values, followed by a gradual warming trend. Concurrently, humidity levels exhibited significant fluctuation, with a spike to saturation in the early hours, then decreasing sharply as temperatures rose, indicating a possible early morning fog that cleared later on. Air pressure remained relatively stable, showing a slight and consistent increase throughout the period, which is indicative of steady weather patterns and possibly clear skies. Wind speeds varied, with calmer conditions at the start and end of the period and a marked increase during the day, suggesting breezier conditions that could have contributed to the dispersal of humidity. Wind direction was predominantly from the south and swung to the north-northwest, which is typical for variable winds in the region with the passage of a weather front.
