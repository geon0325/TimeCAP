Over the last 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperature exhibited a diurnal pattern with cooler conditions in the early hours, which gradually warmed up towards the afternoon and cooled down again in the evening. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with notably higher humidity in the early morning and late evening, indicative of possible morning and evening fog or mist, a common occurrence in the San Francisco area. Air pressure showed a downward trend towards the end of the 24-hour period, suggesting a potential change in weather patterns, possibly leading to increased cloudiness or the approach of a weather front. Wind speeds were moderate throughout the day with some calmer periods, and wind directions varied, although predominantly from the west and southwest, which is typical for coastal San Francisco due to maritime influences. The combination of these factors points to relatively stable weather conditions but with a tendency towards increasing humidity and potential changes in weather stability due to the dropping air pressure observed at the end of the period.
