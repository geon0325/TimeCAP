Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced consistent temperature with a slight dip and then a marginal increase as the day progressed, indicating a typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels remained extremely high throughout the period, even reaching saturation at one point, which could have led to fog or mist, particularly in the early hours. Air pressure was relatively stable with only minor fluctuations, suggesting a period of steady weather without the immediate approach of significant weather systems. Wind speeds were light and decreased even further during the day, which combined with high humidity, may have contributed to a sense of stillness and the potential for slow dispersal of any fog or mist. Wind direction varied but was predominantly from the south, shifting slightly throughout the day, which could have influenced coastal conditions and temperatures in the area.
