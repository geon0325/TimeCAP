The analysis of the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data over the last 20 weeks shows a gradual increase in the ratio of ILI patients, indicating a rising trend in influenza-like cases, although the overall ratio remains below the baseline of 2.9%. The age group 0-4 years has seen a consistent uptick in ILI cases, suggesting a higher vulnerability or exposure in this demographic. Meanwhile, the number of ILI patients in the age group 25-49 years peaked in the earlier weeks and has been on a decline, but still contributes significantly to the overall ILI cases. The age groups 50-64 and 65 or more have experienced a decrease in the number of ILI cases, which may indicate either lower transmission rates or possibly higher immunity levels within these age cohorts. The growing number of ILI cases in the younger population could strain pediatric healthcare resources, while the lower incidence in the older age groups may reduce the pressure on healthcare services catering to these populations.
