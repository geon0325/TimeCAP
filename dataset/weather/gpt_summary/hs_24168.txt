Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have exhibited a typical diurnal pattern, with a peak during the afternoon hours and a gradual decline through the night into the early morning. Humidity levels have been notably high, especially during the early morning when they reached saturation, suggesting the possibility of fog or dew formation during those times. Air pressure remained relatively stable with only slight fluctuations, indicating no significant weather fronts passing through the area. Wind speeds varied, with some hours experiencing moderate breezes; the wind direction was primarily from the south-southeast, which is typical for this region and could contribute to the moisture-laden air. The combination of high humidity, stable pressure, and warm temperatures could lead to the formation of afternoon thunderstorms if conditions become more conducive for convection.
