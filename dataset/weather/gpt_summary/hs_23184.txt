Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has exhibited a gradual increase, peaking during the later hours, indicative of a typical diurnal pattern. Humidity levels remained consistently high, nearing saturation at certain points, which can lead to a muggy feeling and possibly the formation of fog or mist. Air pressure has been steadily increasing, suggesting stable atmospheric conditions and a potential decrease in storm probability. Wind speeds have been relatively light and exhibited little variation, which might lead to poor dispersion of pollutants, potentially affecting air quality. The wind direction has been primarily from the south, which is common for Houston and may contribute to the transport of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, reinforcing the high humidity levels observed.
