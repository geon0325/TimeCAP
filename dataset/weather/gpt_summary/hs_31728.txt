Over the last 24 hours, Houston experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature, maintaining generally warm conditions with a subtle cooling trend towards the latter part of the period. Humidity levels were high, often reaching saturation, which could have resulted in a muggy feel and potentially contributed to the formation of fog or mist. Air pressure showed a gradual decline, suggesting a potential change in weather patterns, such as the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds varied modestly but were generally light to gentle, with wind direction shifting significantly throughout the period, indicating variable and potentially unsettled weather conditions. The combination of high humidity, decreasing pressure, and variable winds may signal the likelihood of developing precipitation or thunderstorms in the near future.
