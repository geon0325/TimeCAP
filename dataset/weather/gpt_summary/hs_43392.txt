Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a notable increase in temperatures, reaching a peak in the late afternoon before gradually declining toward the evening. Humidity levels showed significant variation, with particularly high values during the early morning hours, indicating potential morning fog or dew, which then decreased as temperatures rose. Air pressure remained relatively steady throughout the day with only slight fluctuations, suggesting stable weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a few hours in the afternoon when the wind picked up slightly, which may have contributed to a perceived drop in humidity due to increased evaporation and mixing. The wind direction was predominantly from the south, shifting slightly throughout the day, which is typical for Houston and could have been responsible for the transport of warmer air masses into the area.
