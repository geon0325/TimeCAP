Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a noticeable decline in temperature followed by a gradual increase, suggesting the transition from warmer daytime conditions to cooler night conditions and back to warmth. Humidity levels peaked during the coldest hours, which is typical as cooler air holds less moisture, leading to higher relative humidity percentages. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with only a slight increase and subsequent decrease, indicating stable weather conditions without the immediate presence of significant weather fronts. Wind speeds decreased to almost calm conditions and then slightly picked up again, which could have contributed to the variation in temperature and humidity by affecting the dispersal of ground-level air. The predominant wind direction varied, showing a shift from westerly winds to a brief southerly direction before returning to a westerly orientation, which could influence coastal fog formation and dispersal in the area.
