Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a fluctuating but overall increasing trend in the number of respiratory specimens tested for influenza, peaking at 13,380 in the most recent week. Despite the increasing volume of tests, the percentage of positive specimens has remained relatively stable, with an average positive rate of 6.26%, and has not exceeded the 5% threshold often associated with epidemic activity. Influenza B has consistently been the predominant strain, with its ratio of positive specimens significantly higher than that of Influenza A, although both subtypes show a slight increase in positivity rates towards the end of the period. The peak in positive Influenza B cases was at the beginning of the period with a 3.52% positivity rate, while Influenza A's highest positivity rate occurred later at 1.20%. These trends suggest that while testing has increased, the prevalence of influenza remains relatively controlled, but continued surveillance is necessary to monitor any potential upticks in activity that could strain healthcare resources.
