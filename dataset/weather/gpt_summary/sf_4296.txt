Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a modest fluctuation in temperature, with a general increase during the daylight hours followed by a typical nocturnal decline. Humidity levels have varied significantly, reaching saturation during the early morning hours but then dropping substantially, indicating the presence of a drying trend as the day progressed. Air pressure was relatively stable initially but then showed a marked increase, suggesting the strengthening of a high-pressure system over the area. Wind speeds remained mostly light with occasional calm conditions, and wind directions were variable, with no dominant pattern, suggesting a lack of strong weather fronts moving through. The combination of high humidity in the morning, rising pressure, and variable winds indicates a transition to clearer conditions, likely leading to stable and potentially warmer weather in the near term.
