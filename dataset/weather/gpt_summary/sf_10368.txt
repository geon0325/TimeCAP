Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have exhibited a typical diurnal pattern with a gradual increase during the daytime hours, reaching a peak in the late afternoon before cooling down towards the evening and overnight. Humidity levels started moderately high and saw an increase during the night and early morning hours, indicative of possible coastal moisture or fog, before decreasing significantly towards the latter part of the day, suggesting drier conditions as the day progressed. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable and high throughout the period, with a slight increasing trend towards the middle of the day, which is often associated with settled weather and less likelihood of precipitation. Wind speeds were generally light with minimal fluctuations, which could lead to calm weather conditions and potentially the accumulation of pollutants or development of fog in the absence of significant wind to disperse them. Wind direction varied widely but predominantly came from the northern and western quadrants, which is typical for San Francisco, given its coastal location and prevailing wind patterns in the region.
