Over the last 20 weeks, the data exhibits a decrease in the number of overall patients presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms across all age groups. Despite this general downtrend, the proportion of ILI patients has recently shown a mild increase, though it remains below the baseline level for determining an influenza outbreak. The youngest age group (0-4 years) consistently accounts for the highest number of ILI cases among the specified age brackets, signaling a heightened vulnerability in this population. The recent uptick in the ILI ratio suggests a need for continued monitoring, especially as it could indicate the start of an upward trend in ILI prevalence. Healthcare systems should be aware of these dynamics to allocate resources effectively and prepare for potential increases in ILI cases.
