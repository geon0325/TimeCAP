Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a notable fluctuation in temperature with a peak during the afternoon hours and a significant drop in the early morning, consistent with diurnal patterns. Humidity levels showed a sharp increase during the nighttime, which is typical as temperatures fall, reaching saturation that can lead to morning fog or dew. Air pressure has been relatively stable, with only minor variations, though there has been a slight downward trend, which could indicate the potential for changing weather patterns or the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds have been mostly light to moderate, with a period of calm winds during the night, and the predominant wind direction has shifted from southerly to northerly and back again, reflecting the passage of a frontal system or local breezes. Overall, these indicators suggest typical weather for Houston but the slight decrease in pressure may need to be monitored for any further signs of evolving weather situations.
