Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, indicating a warming trend. Humidity levels started high and fluctuated slightly, but there was a noticeable decrease towards the end of the period, which could suggest a reduction in the mugginess that is often felt in the air. Air pressure showed a general decreasing trend, which might be indicative of an approaching weather system that could bring changes in the weather, such as increased cloudiness or a chance of precipitation. The wind speed has been increasing, pointing to more breezy conditions which, combined with lower humidity, might make for more comfortable outdoor conditions. Wind direction has shifted slightly but remained predominantly from the south, which is typical for Houston and could be contributing to the warmer temperatures observed.
