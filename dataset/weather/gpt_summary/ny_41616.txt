Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a notable increase in temperature, reaching a peak in the latter part of the day, indicative of a warm front. Humidity levels started high but saw a significant decrease as temperatures rose, suggesting the presence of drier air moving into the area. Air pressure was relatively stable initially but saw a gradual increase, reaching a peak before decreasing slightly, which could be associated with the passage of a high-pressure system followed by a slight pressure trough. Wind speeds varied modestly throughout the period, with some hours experiencing calmer conditions, while other hours saw moderate wind speeds. The wind direction was predominantly from the west to southwest, shifting slightly throughout the day, which could be contributing to the transport of warmer air into the region.
