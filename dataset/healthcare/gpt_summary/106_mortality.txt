Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a general decreasing trend in the total number of deaths, declining from 58,206 to 52,709. During this period, the number of deaths from influenza has decreased significantly from 246 to 29, while deaths from pneumonia have also decreased but less sharply, from 4,098 to 3,117. The ratio of mortality from influenza or pneumonia to the total number of deaths started at 7.46%, peaked at 7.75% in week 9, but has since decreased, falling below the 20-week average of 7.84% to 5.97% in the last week. This overall decline in both the number and ratio of influenza and pneumonia deaths could suggest an easing burden on healthcare resources specifically from these illnesses. However, it is important to remain vigilant as seasonal trends and possible emerging strains could alter this trajectory.
