Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 exhibited a general uptrend, increasing from 4550.58 to 4781.58, signaling investor optimism and potential economic strength. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, remained relatively low and stable, fluctuating between 12.43 and 13.67, which suggests a stable market with subdued investor anxiety. The Nikkei 225 showed a degree of volatility, initially declining but then recovering towards the end of the period, closing at 33681.24, which may indicate resilience in the Japanese market. Gold futures saw a notable increase in value, moving from 2047.10 to 2081.90, possibly reflecting investors' hedging against inflation or seeking safe-haven assets amidst geopolitical uncertainties. The exchange rates for EUR/USD and USD/CNY remained relatively flat, indicating a period of stability in currency markets; however, the USD/JPY experienced a slight depreciation from 147.06 to 142.46, which could suggest a shift in investor sentiment towards the yen or changes in comparative interest rate expectations.
