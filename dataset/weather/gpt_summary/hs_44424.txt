Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, indicating a cooling trend. The humidity levels showed significant variability, with an increase during the cooler early hours and a decrease as temperatures rose, which is typical due to the inverse relationship between temperature and humidity. Air pressure has been relatively stable, with a slight increase towards the end of the period, suggesting stable weather conditions may continue. Wind speeds have varied, with a notable increase in the latter hours, which could contribute to cooler perceived temperatures and might indicate the approach of a weather system. The wind direction has been predominantly southerly, shifting to a more northerly direction later on, which often brings cooler air masses to the region.
