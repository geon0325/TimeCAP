Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have exhibited a typical diurnal cycle with the warmest conditions occurring in the late afternoon and cooler temperatures during the early morning hours. Humidity levels have fluctuated significantly, starting off relatively high, decreasing throughout the day as temperatures peaked, and then increasing again overnight as temperatures cooled. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase indicating steady weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally light and variable, with a slight uptick in the afternoon, which is common as the land heats up and can create breezier conditions. The wind direction shifted from easterly in the morning to a more southeasterly direction throughout the day, which is consistent with the sea breeze effect that can occur in coastal areas like Houston.
