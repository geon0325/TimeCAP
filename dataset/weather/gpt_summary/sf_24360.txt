Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have exhibited a diurnal pattern with a clear drop during the early morning hours followed by a gradual increase throughout the day, which is typical for the region. Humidity levels have generally remained high, although they showed some fluctuations, decreasing during the warmest parts of the day and increasing again in the cooler evening and nighttime hours, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight dip towards the latter part of the analysis period, which could indicate the approaching of a weather system that may affect local conditions. Wind speeds varied, with periods of stronger gusts interspersed with more settled conditions; a notable increase in wind speed during the night could correlate with the drop in temperature. The wind direction was predominantly from the west, with occasional shifts, which is characteristic of the maritime influence on San Francisco's weather.
