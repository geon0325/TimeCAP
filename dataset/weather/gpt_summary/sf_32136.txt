Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a noticeable warming trend, with the temperature rising significantly, particularly in the latter hours, suggesting a warm front may have moved into the area. Humidity levels have varied, starting high, decreasing towards the middle of the period, and then fluctuating, which is typical for coastal cities and can contribute to the feeling of warmth or coolness. Air pressure experienced a slight increase in the middle of the period but showed a drop towards the end, which could indicate a change in weather patterns, possibly leading to increased wind activity or precipitation. Speaking of wind, the speed has been relatively moderate with some fluctuations, and there was a significant increase in wind speed at the end of the period that could bring cooler temperatures or clear skies. The wind direction has been variable, with a notable shift from northerly to westerly and then back to a northerly component, which could affect marine layer development and impact coastal weather conditions.
