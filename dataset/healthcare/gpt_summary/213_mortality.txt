Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable decline in the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia to the total number of deaths, from a high of 14.32% to a low of 6.13%. Despite fluctuations, the total number of deaths has shown a slight decreasing trend, while deaths specifically from influenza have remained relatively low with minor variations. Deaths from pneumonia started at 10,202 in the first week and exhibited a steady decrease to 3,474 in the last week, aligning with the overall declining trend in the mortality ratio. The current ratio of 6.13% sits significantly below the 20-week average of 7.84%, indicating a potential improvement in the management or severity of these conditions. This trend could suggest either a successful healthcare response to these illnesses or seasonal variations in their prevalence, both of which are important for resource allocation and planning in healthcare systems.
