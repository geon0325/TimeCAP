Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a slight decrease in temperature, indicating a trend towards cooler conditions. Humidity levels have varied but have generally remained high, with a significant increase observed later in the period, which could lead to a perception of colder weather due to increased dampness. Air pressure has risen steadily throughout the period, suggesting the arrival of a high-pressure system that could lead to more stable and clearer weather conditions in the near future. Wind speeds were consistently light, with a notable increase at one point, which may have contributed to a temporary wind chill effect. The wind direction was predominantly westerly, with a shift to a more northerly component at times, which is typical for cooler and potentially drier air masses moving into the area.
