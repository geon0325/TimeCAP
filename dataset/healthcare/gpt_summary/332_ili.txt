Over the last 20 weeks, the data shows a fluctuating trend in the number of patients presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI), with the number of patients initially remaining relatively stable before increasing and then decreasing towards the end of the period. Notably, there has been an upward trend in the ratio of ILI patients, which surpassed the baseline threshold, indicating a period of heightened influenza activity. Age-specific analysis reveals that the highest count of ILI cases has consistently been within the 0-4 and 5-24 age groups, with these groups experiencing peaks concurrently with the overall ILI patient ratio increases. The 25-49 age group also showed a significant rise in ILI cases, followed by a decrease that paralleled the overall trend. The observed patterns suggest an increased demand for healthcare resources during the peak periods, especially in pediatric and young adult populations, which may necessitate targeted public health interventions and resource allocation to manage the surge in ILI cases.
