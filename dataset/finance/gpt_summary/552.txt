Concurrently, the VIX has declined from 20.69 to 16.69, indicating reduced market volatility and potentially increasing risk appetite among investors. The Nikkei 225 showed volatility with a downward trend mid-period but recovered towards the end, while the FTSE 100 experienced a general upward movement, closing higher than the starting point, which may reflect improving economic outlooks in the respective regions. Gold Futures prices fluctuated but ended slightly higher, reflecting ongoing uncertainty and a possible hedge against inflation. Currency markets showed the USD strengthening against the JPY but remained relatively stable against the CNY and the EUR, which could influence export dynamics and international trade flows.
