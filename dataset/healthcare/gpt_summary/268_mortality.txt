Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a decreasing trend in the proportion of deaths attributed to influenza or pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, starting at 11.15% and ending at 6.24%, with a significant drop in the early weeks. Despite this decline, the final ratio of 6.24% remains below the average ratio of 7.84%, suggesting a possible improvement in managing these conditions or a seasonal reduction in cases. The total number of deaths fluctuated but showed a slight downward trend over the period, which could indicate an overall improvement in public health or other factors affecting mortality rates. Notably, the number of deaths specifically from influenza remained relatively low and stable, implying effective influenza control measures or low viral circulation. However, the number of deaths from pneumonia showed a more pronounced decrease from 7303 to 3589, which may reflect seasonal variations, improved treatment protocols, or changes in the prevalence of pneumonia-causing pathogens.
