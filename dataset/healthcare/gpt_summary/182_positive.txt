Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a general decline in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the ratio of positive specimens decreasing from 14.94% to 2.08%. The number of specimens tested has fluctuated, with an initial decrease followed by a slight increase in recent weeks. Influenza A has shown a more pronounced decrease in positivity than Influenza B, with its ratio dropping from 13.32% to 0.94%, while Influenza B's ratio decreased less steeply, from 1.63% to 1.14%. Despite the overall reduction in positive cases, the healthcare system should remain vigilant as the recent uptick in specimen testing could indicate increased surveillance or a potential rise in respiratory illness. The sustained presence of both Influenza A and B suggests that continued efforts in prevention, such as vaccination and public education, are essential to control the spread of influenza.
