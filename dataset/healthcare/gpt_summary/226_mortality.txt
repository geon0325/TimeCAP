Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable upward trend in the proportion of deaths attributed to influenza or pneumonia, with the ratio of mortality from these conditions to total deaths increasing from 7.78% to 16.00%. This trend is particularly concerning given that the average ratio over this period has risen well above the stated average of 7.84%, suggesting a significant increase in the impact of these illnesses on overall mortality. The number of deaths from pneumonia has shown a marked increase, starting from 4,529 in the first week and reaching a peak of 12,316 in the 17th week, before slightly decreasing to 11,511 in the 20th week. Meanwhile, deaths from influenza have remained relatively low but have seen a slight increase in recent weeks, reaching 18 in the last week from a low of 3 in the ninth week. This situation poses a potential strain on healthcare resources and underscores the need for continued surveillance and possibly enhanced public health interventions to manage the spread and impact of these respiratory diseases.
