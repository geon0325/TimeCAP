Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has demonstrated volatility with a downward trend, starting at 4076.60 and ending at 3970.15, indicating potential investor uncertainty and a possible bearish sentiment in the market. The VIX, which measures market volatility, has fluctuated moderately but stayed relatively elevated, suggesting that investors are expecting continued market fluctuations. Gold Futures have seen a decline from 1929.50 to 1828.90, reflecting a shift away from safe-haven assets, which may indicate a risk-on mood among investors despite the stock marketâ€™s downturn. The strengthening of the USD against the JPY from 130.48 to 136.32 could point to a preference for the safety of the dollar or concerns about Japan's economy, while the USD/CNY exchange rate also saw the dollar appreciate, ending at 6.94, which could impact US-China trade dynamics. Meanwhile, both the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 indices showed resilience, with the latter reaching new highs, suggesting regional confidence despite global market uncertainties.
