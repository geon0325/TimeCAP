Over the past 24 hours in New York City, there has been a slight but steady decline in temperature followed by a modest increase, suggesting a typical diurnal pattern with cooler temperatures in the early hours warming up later in the day. Humidity levels have remained high and relatively stable, which could contribute to a feeling of chilliness in the air despite the rising temperatures. The air pressure has shown a consistent and notable upward trend, indicating the strengthening of a high-pressure system that is likely to lead to settled and clear weather conditions. Wind speeds have been moderate and constant throughout the period, with no significant gusts or lulls. The wind direction has predominantly been from the west and northwest, which is common for this region and can bring cooler air masses during this time of year.
