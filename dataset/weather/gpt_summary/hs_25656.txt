Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has shown a warming trend, peaking in the late afternoon before gradually cooling towards the evening. Humidity levels were exceptionally high during the night and early morning, indicating a likelihood of heavy air and potential fog, but they decreased significantly as the temperature rose throughout the day. Air pressure has been slowly decreasing, which could suggest an approaching weather system that may bring changes in the near future. Wind speeds have been relatively light and variable, with some increase in the afternoon, but not significant enough to greatly affect conditions on the ground. The wind direction has been predominantly from the south, shifting slightly to include southeasterly and southwesterly variations, which is typical for Houston and often associated with warm air and moisture being brought in from the Gulf of Mexico.
