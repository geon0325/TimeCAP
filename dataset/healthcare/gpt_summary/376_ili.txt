Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a gradual increase in Influenza-like Illness (ILI) across all age groups until reaching a peak, with the proportion of ILI cases subsequently declining. The highest ratio of ILI patients occurred in week 10, with a value of 2.67%, which is the only instance where ILI cases surpassed the 2.9% severity benchmark. Since then, there has been a noticeable downward trend in both the number of ILI cases across all age groups and the ratio of ILI patients, which has decreased to 1.53% by week 20. This decline suggests a reduction in the spread or severity of ILI, relieving potential pressure on the healthcare system. However, the continuing presence of ILI cases, particularly among the young (ages 0-4) and school-aged children (ages 5-24), who represent the highest number of cases, indicates the need for ongoing surveillance and preparedness for potential upticks in ILI incidence.
