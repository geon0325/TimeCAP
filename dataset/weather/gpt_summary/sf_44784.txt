Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced remarkably stable weather conditions, with no fluctuations in temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed, or wind direction. The consistency in temperature indicates a strong and persistent weather pattern, likely due to a high-pressure system in place. Low humidity levels may have led to dry conditions, increasing the potential for discomfort among residents and the risk of wildfires in the surrounding areas. Steady wind speeds coupled with a uniform direction suggest that the atmospheric conditions have been largely undisturbed during this period. The lack of change in air pressure further supports the presence of a stagnant weather scenario, which could persist unless a significant weather system moves into the area.
