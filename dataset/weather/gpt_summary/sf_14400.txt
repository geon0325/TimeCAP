Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a noticeable warming trend with temperatures increasing significantly, reaching a peak in the late afternoon before gradually declining. Meanwhile, humidity levels showed considerable fluctuations, with a sharp increase during the early hours, which could be indicative of morning fog or coastal marine layer presence, later decreasing towards the afternoon as temperatures rose. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with a slight dip observed in the evening, which may suggest the approach of a weather system or front. Wind speeds varied, with periods of calm interspersed with moderate gusts, and the wind direction shifted throughout the day, suggesting a dynamic weather pattern with potential for changing conditions. The combination of rising temperatures, variable humidity, steady pressure, and shifting winds could lead to a mix of weather conditions, including the possibility of coastal fog, urban heat effects, and changing wind patterns affecting San Francisco's microclimates.
