Over the last 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have experienced minor fluctuations but have generally maintained a consistent warmth. Humidity levels started very high and saw a gradual decrease throughout the period, indicating a possible reduction in the mugginess that can be felt in the air. Air pressure, after some variability, notably increased in the latter part of the time series, suggesting the potential development or movement of a high-pressure system in the region. Wind speeds remained fairly light to moderate without any significant peaks, which could mean a relatively calm period wind-wise for the residents. The wind direction varied widely, starting with a northerly direction, shifting predominantly to the east, and ending with more variable conditions, which might imply a changing weather system passing through the area.
