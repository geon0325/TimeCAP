Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced relatively stable temperatures with minor fluctuations, maintaining a consistent range that suggests a lack of significant thermal events. Humidity levels showed substantial variance, with periods of complete saturation, indicating the presence of fog or mist, especially when aligned with 100% humidity readings, but these levels dropped significantly towards the end of the observed period which could suggest the arrival of a drier air mass. The air pressure has been generally steady, with a notable increase towards the latter part of the period, a sign that could be associated with the building of a high-pressure system potentially leading to clearer skies. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with occasional calmer periods, and the wind direction varied widely which implies changing wind patterns and could be indicative of a transitional weather phase. The combination of these factors points towards a dynamic local weather situation, with potential for improving conditions following the dispersal of earlier moisture.
