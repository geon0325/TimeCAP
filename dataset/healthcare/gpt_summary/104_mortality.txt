Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia to total deaths has shown a general decline, starting above the 20-week average of 7.84% but ending below it, with a high of 7.75% in week 11 and concluding at 5.99% in week 20. Despite fluctuations, the total number of deaths has remained relatively stable, with a slight decrease from 58,285 in week 1 to 53,563 in week 20. The number of deaths specifically attributable to Influenza has significantly decreased from 211 in week 1 to 50 in week 20, suggesting a downward trend in Influenza-related mortality. Pneumonia deaths have also shown a decreasing trend from 3,919 to 3,158 over the same period. This overall decline in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia may indicate effectiveness in current healthcare interventions and vaccination strategies, but continuous monitoring is essential to manage potential seasonal fluctuations and emerging strains.
