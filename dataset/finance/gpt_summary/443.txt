Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with an overall downward trend, ending lower by approximately 4% from its high, indicative of investor uncertainty and potential bearish sentiment. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, has increased, peaking at 40.28, which aligns with the observed fluctuations in the S&P 500 and suggests increased market stress. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 also experienced declines, signaling a broader global market retreat, with the Nikkei dropping by roughly 3.6% and the FTSE 100 by about 6.2% from their respective values at the start of the period. Commodity prices have been mixed; Gold Futures have seen minor fluctuations but maintained relative stability, indicating it's still seen as a safe haven, whereas Crude Oil Futures have fallen by almost 9%, potentially reflecting concerns over global economic growth. Currency exchange rates have remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations in EUR/USD and USD/JPY, while USD/CNY saw slight variation, suggesting that currency markets have not experienced the same level of volatility as equity and commodity markets during this period.
