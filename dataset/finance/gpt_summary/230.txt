Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a steady uptrend, closing higher by approximately 3.16% from 3140.98 to 3240.02, indicating a positive sentiment among investors. Volatility, as measured by the VIX, remained relatively low with minor fluctuations, ending slightly higher at 13.43, suggesting that while the market has been climbing, investors are not significantly more fearful or uncertain about the market's future direction. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 both trended upwards, with the FTSE 100 showing a notable rally, closing up by 4.06% which could indicate increasing investor confidence in the UK market, potentially reflecting easing concerns around Brexit during this period. Gold Futures experienced moderate volatility but ended higher at 1513.80, which may suggest that investors are still hedging against potential risks despite the overall market gains. The exchange rates for EUR/USD and USD/JPY remained relatively stable, hinting at a current balance in trade expectations, while the slight decrease in USD/CNY from 7.03 to 7.00 could imply a modest strengthening of the Chinese yuan or a shift in the US-China trade outlook.
