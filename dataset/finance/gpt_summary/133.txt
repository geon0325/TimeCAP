Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 exhibited a general downward trend, declining from 3014.30 to 2918.65, indicating potential unease in equity markets. The VIX, or Volatility Index, has shown increased volatility, peaking at 24.59 before settling at 17.97, which suggests growing investor anxiety. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 also experienced declines, with the Nikkei dropping from 21685.90 to 20684.82 and the FTSE 100 from 7531.70 to 7253.90, reflecting broader market uncertainties. Gold Futures rose from 1411.40 to 1496.60, a traditional sign of investors seeking safe-haven assets during times of market stress. Meanwhile, significant movements in currency exchanges have been observed, with the USD experiencing depreciation against JPY and appreciation against CNY, while EUR/USD has remained relatively stable, which could indicate shifts in regional economic expectations and potential impacts on international trade dynamics.
