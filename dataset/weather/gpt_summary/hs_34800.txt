Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a notable fluctuation in temperature, peaking during the afternoon hours, indicative of typical diurnal variation, and a significant drop towards the early morning hours, which may suggest the passage of a frontal system or radiational cooling. Humidity levels have varied inversely with temperature, reaching saturation in the early morning hours, which could result in fog formation or dew. Air pressure experienced a sharp increase in the early afternoon, possibly signaling the movement of a high-pressure system into the area, followed by a decrease in the evening, which might suggest the subsequent approach of a low-pressure system that could lead to changing weather conditions. Wind speeds remained constant and very light throughout the period, offering little relief from the heat of the day and suggesting a stagnant air mass over the region. Wind direction varied only slightly, with a more northerly component during the earlier hours and shifting to a more easterly direction later on, which could impact local temperature and humidity levels depending on the source regions of the air masses.
