Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in Influenza-like Illness (ILI) across different age groups, with a general upward trend in the percentage of ILI patients, which, however, remained below the baseline of 2.9% for determining heightened influenza activity. The largest relative increase in ILI cases was observed among the youngest age group (0-4 years), indicating a potential higher vulnerability or increased transmission within this demographic. The age group of 25-49 years initially saw a decrease in ILI cases but then experienced a plateau, suggesting stabilization in the prevalence of ILI in this demographic. Despite fluctuations, the ratio of ILI patients has not crossed the threshold to indicate a widespread influenza outbreak, but healthcare providers should remain vigilant, especially considering the steady increase in the ratio over the last weeks of the data. Planning for resource allocation, vaccination efforts, and public health messaging should take into account the current trends and the possibility of future increases in ILI cases.
