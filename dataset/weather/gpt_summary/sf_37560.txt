Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature towards the early morning hours, followed by a rise as the day progressed. Humidity levels started relatively high and peaked twice, suggesting potential early morning and late evening fog or mist, common in the region, before a significant drop towards the evening, indicating drier conditions. Air pressure remained fairly stable for most of the period but showed a noticeable decrease midday, which could be associated with a passing weather system that might have led to the variations in humidity and temperature. Wind speeds were generally light and calm, with a slight increase around the afternoon, which could have contributed to the dispersal of any fog or mist. Wind direction varied significantly throughout the day, with shifts from westerly to northerly and even easterly directions, suggesting a changing weather pattern that could affect local temperatures and cloud cover.
