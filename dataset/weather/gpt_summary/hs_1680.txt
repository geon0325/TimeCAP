Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable downward trend in temperature, transitioning from mild conditions to cooler temperatures, indicative of a cold front passage. Humidity levels fluctuated considerably, starting high, dipping midday as the temperatures dropped, then increasing again towards the evening, suggesting a potential for morning dew or fog formation. Air pressure has been gradually increasing, which is typically associated with stabilizing weather conditions and the arrival of a high-pressure system. Wind speed demonstrated variability with a period of calm followed by gustier conditions, particularly when the wind direction shifted from southerly to a more northerly component, reinforcing the presence of a cold front. The changing wind direction aligns with the frontal system's movement and could lead to clearer skies and drier conditions following the front's passage.
