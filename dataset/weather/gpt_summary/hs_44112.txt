Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature, showing a peak during the late afternoon and early evening, which is typical for the region's warm climate. Humidity levels experienced significant variation, with the highest values occurring during the early morning hours, likely contributing to a sense of mugginess, and potentially leading to morning fog or dew. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with only minor fluctuations that suggest a steady weather pattern without the presence of strong weather fronts or storm systems. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with a notable increase in the late evening, which could have dispersed humidity and provided some relief from the day's heat. The wind direction varied significantly, indicating that different air masses may have been influencing the local weather, potentially affecting temperature and humidity levels.
