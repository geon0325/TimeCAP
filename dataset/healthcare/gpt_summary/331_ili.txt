Over the past 20 weeks, the data indicates a gradual increase in the percentage of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases among the patient population, with a notable rise that surpassed the baseline of 2.9% in the later weeks. This uptick in ILI cases is particularly evident in the age groups 5-24 and 25-49, which showed significant increases, suggesting that these age cohorts may be driving the overall rise in ILI incidence. Despite fluctuations, the oldest age group (65 or more) has seen a relatively steady contribution to ILI rates, indicating a persistent vulnerability in this demographic. The recent trend of ILI ratios suggests that the healthcare system may face increased demand for medical services, particularly in pediatric and adult care, which could strain resources and necessitate a public health response to address the growing numbers. Given that the ILI ratio has not yet shown signs of decline, continued monitoring and preparedness measures are crucial to manage potential impacts on healthcare delivery and public health.
