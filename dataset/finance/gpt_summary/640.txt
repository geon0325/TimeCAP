Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a gradual uptrend, closing higher from an initial 4258.49 to 4468.00, suggesting a bullish market sentiment. In contrast, the VIX, a measure of market volatility, has decreased from 22.50 to 15.45, indicating a reduction in investor fear and a more stable market outlook. The Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have both experienced general upward movements, with the Nikkei 225 closing slightly below its high, and the FTSE 100 reaching a new high at 7218.70, reflecting positive momentum in these markets. Gold Futures experienced a significant drop in value mid-period but have since recovered to close higher at 1775.20, which may suggest increasing investor interest in safe-haven assets amidst global uncertainties. The currency markets have shown the US dollar strengthening against the Japanese Yen and remaining relatively stable against the Chinese Yuan, while it has weakened against the Euro, closing at 1.17 EUR/USD down from 1.18, potentially impacting international trade dynamics.
