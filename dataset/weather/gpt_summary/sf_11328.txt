Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperature experienced some fluctuations with a notable drop during certain hours, suggesting the possibility of a passing frontal system or localized atmospheric conditions causing rapid changes. Humidity levels varied moderately, with a peak observed in tandem with the temperature dip, indicative of increased moisture in the air during cooler conditions. Barometric pressure remained relatively stable, with slight variations suggesting stable weather patterns with no significant storms or pressure systems moving through the area. Wind speeds were generally light with a brief period of slightly increased velocity, while wind direction shifts from predominantly westerly to calm conditions occurred, which is typical for coastal cities like San Francisco. The overall weather pattern suggests a stable environment, but the brief temperature and humidity changes highlight the microclimatic variability that the region is known for.
