Over the last 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable increase in temperature, peaking during the late afternoon before gradually starting to decrease. Humidity levels have experienced significant fluctuations, with very high values during the early morning hours, indicating the possibility of morning fog or dew, then decreasing markedly as temperatures rose. Air pressure has shown a slight downward trend, which could suggest an approaching weather system or front. Wind speeds have been generally light, with a slight increase during the middle of the day, and the wind direction has been variable, predominantly coming from the east-northeast but shifting at times throughout the period. The combination of high humidity, rising temperatures, and decreasing air pressure may lead to the development of unsettled weather conditions, potentially including thunderstorms or rain showers.
