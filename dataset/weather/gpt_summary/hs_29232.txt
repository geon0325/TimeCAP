Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a slight decrease in temperature, which was followed by a significant increase, suggesting a fluctuation in weather conditions. Humidity levels showed a sharp drop towards the latter part of the period, indicating a transition to dryer conditions after experiencing higher humidity earlier on. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, but an overall increase was observed, which might suggest the presence of a high-pressure system moving into the area. Wind speed varied moderately throughout the period and peaked at certain hours, which could have contributed to the dispersal of humidity and the variation in temperatures observed. Lastly, the wind direction shifted significantly from southerly to northerly, which often correlates with the passage of a frontal system and could explain the changes in temperature and humidity levels in Houston.
