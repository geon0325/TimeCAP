Over the past 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with a notable dip towards the middle of the period followed by a recovery, ending slightly lower than its peak. The VIX, or Volatility Index, spiked significantly during the S&P's dip, reaching a high of 24.59, indicating increased market uncertainty during that time, but it has since trended downwards, suggesting a stabilization of investor sentiment. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 also experienced downturns, with the Nikkei showing a slight recovery towards the end, while the FTSE remained subdued, reflecting broader global market uncertainties.

Gold Futures peaked at $1507.30, correlating with heightened market volatility and suggesting a flight to safety among investors, but the price has since softened to $1500.40. Crude Oil Futures saw a sharp drop in the middle of the time series, potentially due to global demand concerns, but ended on a more stable note, while currency pairs EUR/USD and USD/JPY showed minor fluctuations, and the USD/CNY pair indicated a slight devaluation of the yuan against the dollar, which might reflect trade tensions or policy moves by China.
