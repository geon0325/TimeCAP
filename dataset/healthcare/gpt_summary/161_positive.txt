Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant increase in the ratio of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, showing a rise from 2.73% in the first week to a peak of 26.24% by the 16th week, before a slight decrease to 22.48% in the final week. Influenza A has been the predominant strain throughout the period, with its highest positive specimen ratio reaching 25.36% in week 16, while Influenza B showed a more moderate presence, peaking at 1.28% in the last week. The total number of specimens tested has also increased, starting at 23,563 and peaking at 54,061 in week 16, indicating a heightened effort to monitor the spread of the virus. An increase in positive cases has potential implications for the healthcare system, including increased hospitalizations, a strain on healthcare resources, and a need for heightened public health interventions. The observed trends suggest a seasonal surge in influenza activity which requires continued surveillance and possibly increased vaccination and preventive measures to mitigate the impact on public health.
