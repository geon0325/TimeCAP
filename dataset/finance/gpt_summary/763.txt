Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with a downward trend, starting at 4713.07 and reaching a low of 4397.94 before recovering slightly to close at 4521.54. The VIX, which measures market volatility, mirrored this pattern with an inverse relationship, peaking at 31.96 when the S&P was at its lowest, indicating heightened market uncertainty during that period. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 have similarly experienced fluctuations, with the Nikkei dropping significantly mid-period before partially rebounding, and the FTSE oscillating but ending relatively flat. Gold futures have seen modest gains, moving from 1818.60 to 1826.60, suggesting a flight to safety amid market instability, while crude oil futures have risen sharply, indicating potential inflationary pressures. Currency movements have been less pronounced, with the EUR/USD and USD/CNY pairs showing slight strengthening of the dollar overall, while USD/JPY ended almost flat, suggesting mixed sentiment towards the dollar in currency markets.
