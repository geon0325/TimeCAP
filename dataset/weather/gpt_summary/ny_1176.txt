Over the last 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, which peaked in the late afternoon before beginning to decrease slightly towards the evening. Humidity levels remained relatively stable, with a modest increase during the middle of the day which could have contributed to a feeling of increased mugginess. Air pressure has been on a steady decline throughout the period, indicating a possible change in weather patterns or the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds varied but showed a noticeable increase around midday before stabilizing towards the evening. Wind direction was predominantly from the east and northeast, with some variability, which could have had a cooling effect on the city and may have influenced local weather conditions such as cloud cover and precipitation patterns.
