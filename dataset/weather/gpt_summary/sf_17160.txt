Air pressure remained relatively stable, indicating no significant weather fronts moving through the area that would suggest drastic changes in weather patterns. Wind speeds were mostly light and variable, with a slight increase in the evening, which is consistent with the diurnal patterns of coastal breezes. The wind direction has been predominantly from the west-southwest, which is typical for San Francisco due to its geographic location and prevailing wind patterns off the Pacific Ocean.
