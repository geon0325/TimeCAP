Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in mortality due to Influenza or Pneumonia, with the percentage of deaths attributable to these conditions initially rising above the 20-week average of 7.84% and peaking at 10.89% in week four, followed by a gradual decline to 5.92% in the last recorded week. The highest absolute number of deaths from Influenza occurred in week four with 1,626 deaths, while Pneumonia-related deaths reached their peak in week three with 5,583 deaths. After these peaks, mortality from both Influenza and Pneumonia showed a general downward trend, with Influenza deaths decreasing significantly to just 53 in the final week, and Pneumonia deaths also declining to 3,032. This trend suggests a decrease in the severity or spread of these respiratory conditions in the most recent weeks. However, healthcare systems must continue to monitor these trends closely, as seasonal variations and potential new strains of Influenza can rapidly change the mortality landscape.
