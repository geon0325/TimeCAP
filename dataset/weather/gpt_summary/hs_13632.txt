Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have exhibited a diurnal pattern, with a peak during the afternoon hours and a gradual decrease through the night into the early morning hours. Humidity levels have been relatively high, particularly during the night and early morning, coinciding with lower temperatures, suggesting a likelihood of morning fog or dew. Atmospheric pressure remained quite stable, with only minor fluctuations, indicating no immediate signs of significant weather systems moving into the area. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a notable increase towards the end of the period, which could contribute to dispersal of any early fog or humidity. The prevailing wind direction was primarily from the south to southeast, which is typical for Houston and can bring in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, potentially sustaining the higher humidity levels observed.
