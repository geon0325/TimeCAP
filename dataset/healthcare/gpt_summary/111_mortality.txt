Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable downward trend in the ratio of mortality due to Influenza or Pneumonia, decreasing from 7.69% to 5.50%, suggesting an improvement in the management or severity of these conditions. Despite this decline, the number of deaths attributed to these diseases remains significant, with a combined total of 37,226 deaths from both Influenza and Pneumonia in the observed period. The total number of deaths from all causes has exhibited relative stability, with minor fluctuations but no clear trend. Importantly, the number of deaths from Influenza has decreased markedly from 474 to 13, while deaths from Pneumonia have also reduced from 3987 to 2864. These patterns indicate that while Influenza and Pneumonia continue to contribute to mortality, there might be a decreasing impact or better control measures in place, which could alleviate some pressure on healthcare resources dedicated to these diseases.
