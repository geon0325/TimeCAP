The VIX, a measure of market volatility, has generally trended downwards and remained at relatively low levels, suggesting investor confidence and a stable market outlook. The Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have both experienced fluctuations but ended the period slightly up, signaling resilience in these markets despite ongoing international trade tensions. Gold futures have remained relatively stable with slight increases, reflecting its status as a safe-haven asset amidst minor market uncertainties. Crude oil futures have seen a modest increase, which could indicate a cautiously optimistic outlook on global demand and economic activity, while EUR/USD, USD/JPY, and USD/CNY exchange rates have remained fairly steady, suggesting currency markets are currently experiencing a period of low volatility.
