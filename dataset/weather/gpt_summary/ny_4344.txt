Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature, with a general trend of cooling before warming slightly towards the latter part of the period. Humidity levels varied significantly, starting moderate, increasing to very high overnight, and then dropping to a notably low level before rising again. Atmospheric pressure showed a gradual decrease throughout the day, indicating the potential for changing weather patterns or the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds were mostly calm in the early hours but picked up significantly later on, with the wind direction shifting predominantly from southerly to a more varied pattern, including a notable period of easterly winds. These combined conditions suggest a dynamic and changing weather situation, which could lead to increased cloudiness or the possibility of precipitation if the trend of decreasing pressure and rising humidity continues.
