Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature with a notable warming trend, particularly in the afternoon. Humidity levels have fluctuated significantly, starting moderately, increasing to very high levels during the night and morning hours, and then decreasing somewhat in the afternoon. Air pressure has shown a general decreasing trend suggesting a potential shift in weather patterns or the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds have remained mostly light to gentle, with some increase in the evening, while wind direction has been variable, predominantly coming from the southeast, shifting towards the south-southeast later on, which is typical for the region. These conditions, particularly the combination of increasing temperatures and decreasing air pressure, could indicate the possibility of developing unsettled weather in the near future.
