The VIX, while fluctuating, has generally trended downward from 19.00 to 17.97, suggesting a slight decrease in market risk perception. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have experienced dips and recoveries, with the Nikkei closing lower than its starting point, despite intermittent rallies, and the FTSE 100 showing a more stable rise to end slightly higher. Commodity prices have seen mixed movements, with Gold Futures remaining relatively stable around the $1800 mark, while Crude Oil Futures have faced a sharper decline from $72.94 to $68.15, potentially reflecting concerns over global economic growth. Exchange rates have remained relatively stable, with minor appreciations in the EUR/USD and a slight depreciation in the USD/JPY, which might indicate a modest shift in currency strength favoring the Euro and the Japanese Yen over the US Dollar.
