Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced relatively stable temperatures with a slight warming trend noted towards the latter part of the observed period. Humidity levels have remained at saturation for the majority of the day, suggesting persistent moisture in the air, which could have led to foggy conditions, especially during the cooler early morning and late evening hours. Air pressure varied throughout the day with a notable drop mid-period, potentially indicating a passing weather front or system. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate but increased significantly for a short duration, implying the passage of a more vigorous weather system during that time. The wind direction shifted from predominantly southerly to a westerly and then to a northerly component by the end of the period, suggesting a changing weather pattern that could influence the local climate conditions moving forward.
