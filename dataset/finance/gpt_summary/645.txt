Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 exhibited mild volatility with a general uptrend, closing higher at 4441.67 compared to the starting point of 4422.30, despite some fluctuations. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, also reflected this, with a decrease from an initial 17.58 to 18.56, but with notable spikes, reaching a peak of 21.67, indicating periods of increased investor anxiety. International markets showed more pronounced movements; the Nikkei 225 faced a declining trend, dropping from 27833.29 to 27013.25, while the FTSE 100 showed resilience with an overall increase from 7025.40 to 7087.90. Commodity prices were mixed, with Gold Futures remaining relatively stable around the $1780 mark, whereas Crude Oil Futures experienced a notable downtrend, declining from $71.91 to $62.32, which could signal concerns over future economic growth. The foreign exchange market saw minimal movement, with slight depreciation of the EUR/USD and the USD/CNY pairs, and a small uptick in the USD/JPY, suggesting a modest strengthening of the US dollar during the period.
