Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable upward trend in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the ratio of positive specimens increasing from 1.39% to a peak of 23.65%, before decreasing to 14.02% in the most recent week. Influenza A has consistently been the predominant strain, reaching a high positivity rate of 18.16% in week 16, and although it has since decreased to 8.22%, it remains a significant contributor to the overall influenza positivity rate. Influenza B also showed an increase in positivity rate but has not exceeded the peak rate of Influenza A, peaking at 5.80% in the latest week, indicating a slower decline compared to Influenza A. The overall decrease in the positivity rates for both strains in the most recent weeks suggests a potential decline in influenza activity, although rates remain above the 20-week average of 6.26%. This trend could indicate a transition from the peak of the influenza season, yet healthcare systems should remain vigilant, given that the current rates are still higher than the average, potentially indicating sustained transmission and impact on healthcare resources.
