Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a moderate fluctuation in temperature, beginning and ending the period on a relatively warm note with a noticeable dip towards the cooler side in the early hours. Humidity levels demonstrated a significant spike coinciding with the cooler temperatures but have since stabilized at lower values, suggesting a drier atmosphere during the warmer hours. Air pressure has been gradually decreasing, which could indicate an approaching weather system that may result in changes to the current conditions. Wind speeds have remained mostly light and variable, with a notable shift in direction towards the late hours, transitioning from northerly to easterly directions. The combination of these conditions suggests a stable yet dynamic weather situation, with the potential for further changes driven by the decreasing air pressure and shifting wind direction.
