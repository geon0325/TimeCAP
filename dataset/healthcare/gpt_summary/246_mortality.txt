Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the mortality ratio of Influenza or Pneumonia compared to total deaths, with a clear upward trend from the initial 8.10% to a peak of 18.51%, significantly surpassing the average ratio of 7.84%. This trend suggests an increase in the impact of respiratory infections on overall mortality. There was a sharp increase in deaths attributed to Influenza in the 16th week, which could indicate a potential outbreak or a change in reporting. Pneumonia deaths have also risen steadily, reaching a high in the 14th week before showing a slight decline. Given these trends, healthcare systems may need to allocate more resources to manage and prevent respiratory infections, especially in light of potential seasonal fluctuations or emerging strains.
