Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a slight increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before gradually decreasing towards the evening. Relative humidity levels started high and experienced a significant drop midday, but spiked to saturation at one point, suggesting the possibility of fog or precipitation, and then normalized towards the evening. Air pressure remained fairly stable initially, with a notable dip in the afternoon, which could be indicative of a developing weather system that may affect local conditions. Wind speeds varied moderately throughout the day, with a slight increase towards the afternoon, aligning with the change in air pressure. Wind directions were predominantly from the southeast, shifting significantly to the west in the afternoon, before returning to a southeasterly direction, which is typical for coastal cities like Houston and may bring in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico.
