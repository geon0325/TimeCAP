Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a downward trend, dropping from 4446.59 to 3935.18, reflecting investor concerns and a potential bearish outlook for the market. The VIX, commonly known as the "fear index", has increased, moving from 21.82 to 32.56, indicating higher market volatility and investor uncertainty. Notably, Gold Futures have also decreased from 1981.00 to 1852.60, which can suggest a retreat from safe-haven assets despite market turbulence. The strengthening of the Japanese yen against the USD, with the exchange rate moving from 125.42 to 130.35, could imply a shift towards safer assets in the currency markets, while the slight increase in the USD/CNY exchange rate from 6.36 to 6.73 might suggest concerns over economic growth in China or a strengthening dollar. Lastly, Crude Oil Futures have seen fluctuations but ended on a high note at 105.71, possibly reflecting ongoing geopolitical tensions and supply concerns.
