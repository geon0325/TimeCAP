Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 index initially experienced a downward trend, reaching a low of 3855.76, but subsequently recovered, closing at 4100.60 after peaking at 4124.51, indicating increased market confidence. The VIX, which inversely tracks market volatility, mirrored this movement, spiking to 26.52 during the S&P's low period before settling back to 19.00, suggesting that investor fear has subsided as the market stabilized. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 indices showed a degree of resilience; after a dip, both indices recovered toward the end of the period, with the FTSE 100 almost returning to its high, which suggests a return of positive sentiment in these markets as well. Gold Futures prices increased notably from 1812.70 to 2022.20, reflecting investor hedging against potential market uncertainty and inflation concerns. Crude oil futures also rebounded from a low of 66.74 to 80.71, potentially indicating expectations of increased demand or supply concerns, while major currency pair EUR/USD remained relatively stable with a slight appreciation of the euro against the dollar, and the USD/CNY pair showed minimal fluctuation, suggesting steady forex market conditions in these currencies.
