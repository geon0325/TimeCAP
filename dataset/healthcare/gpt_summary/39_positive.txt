Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable upward trend in the ratio of positive specimens for influenza, surpassing the 20-week average of 6.26% and reaching 2.58% in the most recent week. The number of specimens tested for influenza has increased substantially, with the most recent week seeing 19060 tests, more than triple the number at the beginning of the observed period. Influenza A has shown a more pronounced increase in its positivity ratio compared to Influenza B, rising from 0.40% to 1.82%, indicating that it may be the more prevalent strain in the current trend. Despite this, Influenza B also exhibits a rising trend in positivity, increasing from a ratio of 0.50% to 0.76% over the 20 weeks. This steady increase in both strains of influenza could indicate a growing burden on the healthcare system, necessitating increased resources for testing, treatment, and possibly vaccination efforts.
