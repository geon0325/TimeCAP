Humidity levels have shown considerable fluctuations, starting high but then significantly decreasing before rising again, which could have led to variable comfort levels outdoors. Air pressure has been relatively stable, with a slight increase towards the end of the period, suggesting a possible improvement in weather conditions or the arrival of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds have generally increased, reaching their peak in the second half of the period, which may have contributed to a wind chill effect, making it feel colder than the actual temperature.
