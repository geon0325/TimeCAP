Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures experienced a slight fluctuation with a general cooling trend overnight before gradually warming up again towards the current hour. Humidity levels were significantly high and reached saturation during the night, suggesting the possibility of fog or mist developing, which is typical for San Francisco's microclimate. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable and high throughout the period, which generally indicates settled weather conditions. Wind speeds were consistent and light, which could have contributed to the high humidity levels by limiting air dispersion. The wind direction was predominantly from the southwest, which is common for coastal California and can bring moisture from the ocean onto the land.
