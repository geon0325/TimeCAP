Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a general uptrend, moving from 2584.59 to 2863.39, indicating a recovery from recent lows, which may suggest increasing investor confidence. However, the VIX has remained elevated, averaging around the mid-40s before dropping to the low-30s, pointing to ongoing market volatility and potential investor caution. International markets have displayed mixed signals with the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 experiencing volatility but trending upwards, closing higher at the end of the period which could indicate some stability returning to global markets. The commodities market has been turbulent; Gold Futures remained relatively high, suggesting continued demand for safe-haven assets, while Crude Oil Futures experienced unprecedented volatility, even closing at a negative price, reflecting the severe impact of demand destruction and storage concerns due to COVID-19. Currency exchange rates have been less volatile, with minor fluctuations in EUR/USD and USD/JPY pairings, while USD/CNY shows a slight uptrend, which may signal a cautious approach towards the dollar amidst global economic uncertainty.
