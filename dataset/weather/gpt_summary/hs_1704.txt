Over the last 24 hours in Houston, there has been a gradual increase in temperature, which experienced a noticeable rise during the afternoon hours, indicative of typical diurnal warming. Humidity levels showed variability, with a significant drop observed towards the evening, suggesting the possibility of drier air moving into the area. The air pressure remained relatively stable throughout most of the day but saw a slight decrease before increasing again, which is consistent with the passage of a weak weather system. Wind speeds varied, with calmer conditions prevailing in the latter part of the day, while the wind direction shifted from predominantly northerly to more variable, including easterly and northeasterly directions. These conditions, especially the drop in humidity and the stabilization of air pressure, might lead to clearer skies and more stable weather in the short term.
