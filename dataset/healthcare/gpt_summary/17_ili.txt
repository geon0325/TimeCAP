The analysis of the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data over the last 20 weeks indicates a downward trend in the overall number of patients seeking healthcare, with a corresponding decrease in the number of ILI cases across all age groups. The ratio of ILI patients has remained consistently below the baseline threshold, suggesting a relatively mild ILI season thus far. However, there is a slight uptick in the ratio of ILI patients in recent weeks, warranting close monitoring to determine if this is an early sign of an upward trend. The youngest age group (0-4 years) and school-age group (5-24 years) consistently contribute the highest proportions of ILI cases, which may have implications for pediatric healthcare resources and infection control in schools. Despite the current low severity, healthcare systems should remain vigilant and prepared for a potential increase in ILI cases, which could place additional strain on healthcare resources if the upward trend continues.
