The time-series data over the last 20 weeks indicates a significant surge in respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, peaking between weeks 4 and 6 with ratios of positive specimens reaching above 30%. However, a marked decline in positivity rates is observed thereafter, with the most recent weeks showing ratios below 1%. Influenza A displayed a higher prevalence compared to Influenza B throughout the period, but both have seen a steep decline in recent weeks. Notably, the number of specimens tested has decreased substantially, with the latest figures representing less than 12% of the number tested at the peak, suggesting a potential reduction in surveillance or a decrease in influenza-like illness presentations. This decline in influenza activity may alleviate some immediate pressures on healthcare systems but warrants continued monitoring for potential rebounds or new variants.
