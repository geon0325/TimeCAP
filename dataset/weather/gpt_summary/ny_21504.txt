Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature, with a general trend of cooling towards the latest hours after a modest peak in the late afternoon. Humidity levels started relatively high and increased throughout the day, reaching its peak in the late evening, but then showed a significant decrease by the end of the period, which may have contributed to a feeling of comfort despite the cooler temperatures. Air pressure gradually decreased throughout most of the day, indicating a potential change in weather patterns, but then began to rise again in the last few hours, suggesting a possible stabilization of weather conditions. Wind speeds were relatively light at the beginning of the period but increased steadily, becoming more brisk towards the end of the 24-hour window, with the wind direction shifting from a predominantly southwesterly to northwesterly direction, which could bring clearer and drier air. These changes in wind could also potentially impact temperatures and may lead to a cooler and more stable weather pattern in the near term.
