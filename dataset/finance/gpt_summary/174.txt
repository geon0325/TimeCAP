Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with a general downward trend, ending 3.59% lower than its starting point, which may indicate growing investor unease. The VIX, commonly known as the "fear index," has increased by 38.71%, reflecting heightened market volatility and investor concern. International indices like the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 have also experienced declines, suggesting a broader global market reticence, with the FTSE 100 showing a notable drop of 2.66%. Commodity prices such as Gold Futures have remained relatively stable, indicating investor inclination towards safer assets amidst market uncertainty. Currency markets have seen slight fluctuations with a mild strengthening of the USD against the JPY and stability in EUR/USD and USD/CNY exchange rates, suggesting a holding pattern as markets assess broader economic signals.
