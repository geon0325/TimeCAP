Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant increase in the number of respiratory specimens tested for influenza, with the highest volume reaching 150,872 tests in the final week. The proportion of specimens testing positive for influenza has also risen sharply, peaking at 6.23% in week 17 before declining to 2.44% in week 20. Influenza A has been the predominant strain throughout this period, with its highest positive ratio at 6.17% in week 17, compared to a maximum of 0.08% for Influenza B in the same timeframe. The spike in positive cases, particularly of Influenza A, could indicate a seasonal outbreak, leading to increased strain on healthcare resources due to the rise in influenza-related illnesses. The recent downward trend in positive ratios suggests that the peak of the outbreak may have passed, but continued surveillance is necessary to manage and allocate healthcare resources effectively.
