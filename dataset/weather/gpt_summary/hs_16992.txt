Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature displayed a warming trend, reaching its peak in the late afternoon, consistent with diurnal patterns. Humidity levels were high throughout the period, indicating a muggy atmosphere, but they decreased slightly as temperatures peaked, suggesting some discomfort could have been alleviated during the hottest part of the day. The air pressure remained relatively stable although it showed a slight decreasing trend, which might indicate a minor change in the weather system affecting the area. Wind speeds were generally light to gentle and increased slightly as the day progressed, which could have contributed to the dispersal of humidity and provided some relief from the heat. Wind direction was predominantly from the south, suggesting a flow of warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico, which is typical for Houston and can contribute to the humid conditions experienced.
