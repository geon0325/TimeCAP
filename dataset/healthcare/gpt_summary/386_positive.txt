Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a fluctuation in the rate of positive respiratory specimens for influenza, with an average positivity ratio of 6.26%. The total number of specimens tested has decreased over time, yet the ratio of positive specimens reached a peak of 1.31% in week 14, suggesting a potential surge in infections during that period. Influenza A showed a significant increase in positivity from 0.37% in week 7 to 0.88% in week 19, indicating a resurgence that could strain healthcare resources. Conversely, Influenza B demonstrated a higher positivity ratio earlier in the period, reaching 0.78% in week 12, but has since shown a downward trend. These patterns highlight the importance of ongoing surveillance and preparedness in the healthcare system to manage fluctuations in influenza activity and allocate resources effectively.
