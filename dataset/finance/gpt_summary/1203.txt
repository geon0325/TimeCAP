Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown slight volatility with a gentle upward trend, closing higher at 4382.78 from an initial 4349.61, indicating a cautious optimism in the market. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, has decreased from 16.69 to 14.45, suggesting that investor anxiety has lessened. In contrast, major international indices such as the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 have experienced declines, with the Nikkei showing a more pronounced drop, which may reflect regional market uncertainties and differing economic conditions. Gold futures have seen an overall decrease from 1869.30 to 1951.50, hinting at a reduced demand for safe-haven assets amidst a more risk-on market sentiment. Crude Oil futures have notably declined from 82.91 to 75.33, potentially easing inflationary pressures, while the EUR/USD exchange rate has remained relatively stable, ending slightly higher, which may indicate a steadying of currency markets after recent fluctuations.
