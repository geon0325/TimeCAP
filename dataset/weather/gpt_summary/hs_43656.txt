Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable increase in temperature, which peaked during the later hours of the day before experiencing a slight dip. Humidity levels showed a declining trend as the temperature rose, indicative of typical diurnal variation where warmer temperatures often lead to lower relative humidity. Air pressure slightly decreased after a period of stability, which could signal an approaching weather system or front. Wind speeds varied moderately throughout the day, with a significant increase towards the end of the period, possibly contributing to changes in weather conditions. The wind direction was predominantly from the north, shifting to easterly and southeasterly directions at times, which may have implications for moisture transport and temperature regulation in the area.
