Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable decrease in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the ratio of positive specimens dropping from a high of 9.40% to a low of 0.76% before slightly increasing to 1.50% in the most recent week. The number of specimens tested each week has fluctuated, peaking at 21,483 and then generally trending downwards to a low of 6,292, before increasing again in recent weeks. Influenza A has consistently represented a smaller proportion of the positive cases compared to Influenza B, although both subtypes have seen a decrease in their individual positivity rates over the period analyzed. The recent uptick in positivity rates for both Influenza A and B suggests a potential reversal of the downward trend, which could indicate the beginning of a new wave of infections. Healthcare systems should monitor this possible resurgence closely, as an increase in influenza cases could impact hospital admissions and the overall burden on healthcare resources.
