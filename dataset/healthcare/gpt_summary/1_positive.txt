Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a marked increase in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a starting ratio of 1.30% and reaching up to 18.36% in the latest week. This trend indicates a significant rise in influenza activity, with both Influenza A and B showing increases, but Influenza A demonstrating a more pronounced surge, accounting for the majority of positive cases (14.24% in week 20 compared to Influenza B's 4.12%). The total number of specimens tested has also increased steadily, nearly doubling from 13,111 in the first week to 30,966 in the last week, suggesting an increased demand for testing likely due to rising influenza cases. The substantial growth in positive Influenza A and B cases, with Influenza A cases increasing from 116 to 4410 and Influenza B from 54 to 1276 over the period, could strain healthcare resources due to higher hospitalization rates and increased need for medical care. Public health authorities may need to consider bolstering influenza vaccination efforts, raising public awareness, and preparing healthcare providers for continued or increased influenza activity.
