Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before slightly declining towards the evening. Humidity levels were high during the early hours, consistent with the cooler temperatures, but significantly dropped as temperatures rose, which is typical of diurnal variation. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, indicating no major weather fronts passing through the area. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate and predominately came from the south to southeast in the early hours, shifting to a northerly direction before becoming more variable with a notable shift to a southerly direction in the evening. This combination of rising temperatures, lowering humidity, and steady pressure suggests fair weather for the time being, although the variability in wind direction could indicate changing weather patterns on the horizon.
