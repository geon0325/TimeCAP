Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a slight fluctuating trend in temperature, with a general increase during the day and a decrease towards the evening, remaining relatively warm throughout. Humidity levels varied significantly, peaking during the night and early morning hours, which is indicative of potential discomfort for residents due to mugginess. Air pressure remained mostly stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting that no major weather fronts were passing through the area during that time. Wind speed showed variations, but overall it was moderate, and the wind direction was predominantly from the south to southeast, which is typical for this region and can contribute to the warm and humid conditions experienced. These conditions are consistent with Houston's subtropical climate and do not suggest any immediate severe weather events.
