Over the past 20 market days, the S&P 500 has trended downward, declining from an initial level of 4122.47 to close at 3908.19, signaling a bearish market sentiment. Concurrently, the VIX, or Volatility Index, has generally trended higher, moving from 21.77 to 26.91, which indicates increasing market volatility and potential investor anxiety. In international markets, the Nikkei 225 saw an initial rise, peaking at 29222.77, before reversing to close slightly lower at 27626.51, whereas the FTSE 100 displayed relative stability with a slight downward trend, ending at 7300.40 from an opening of 7488.20. Gold futures have decreased over the period from 1794.00 to 1700.40, reflecting a potential shift in investor preference towards liquidity or other safe-haven assets amid market uncertainty. The currency markets have shown the US dollar strengthening against both the euro (from 1.02 to 1.00 in the EUR/USD pair) and the Japanese yen (from 134.84 to 140.43 in the USD/JPY pair), while it has seen a slight depreciation against the Chinese yuan, from 6.75 to 6.93 in the USD/CNY pair, which might suggest a combination of risk-off sentiment and specific regional economic factors at play.
