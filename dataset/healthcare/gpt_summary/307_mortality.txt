Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia to the total number of deaths started notably higher than the average at 11.22%, peaking at 13.18% in week 5 before exhibiting a gradual decline to a low of 6.19% in week 19, ending slightly higher at 6.31% in week 20. The total number of deaths fluctuated, with an initial increase from 67,820 to 74,257 by week 6, followed by a general decreasing trend to 58,988 by week 20. Notably, there was a significant spike in deaths attributed to influenza in week 7 with 887 deaths, a stark contrast to the otherwise relatively low weekly figures ranging from 19 to 152. Deaths from pneumonia exhibited a decreasing trend from a high of 9,418 in week 5 to 3,674 by week 19, before a slight increase to 3,676 in week 20. These trends suggest a need for continued monitoring and potential resource allocation for pneumonia and influenza, particularly given the substantial fluctuations observed, which could significantly impact healthcare services and planning.
