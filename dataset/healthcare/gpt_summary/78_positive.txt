Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable decline in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the overall ratio of positive specimens decreasing from a peak of 15.43% to 1.34%. This trend is consistent for both Influenza A and B, with Influenza A positive ratios decreasing from 5.03% to 0.82% and Influenza B from 10.40% to 0.53%. Despite a decrease in the number of specimens tested weekly, the decline in positivity rates suggests a reduction in influenza prevalence. The highest reduction observed in Influenza B's positivity rates, which were initially more than double those of Influenza A, indicates a more significant decrease in Influenza B transmission or a possible end to its seasonal peak. The decreasing trend in influenza cases may alleviate some pressure on healthcare resources, allowing for reallocation to other areas as the season progresses.
