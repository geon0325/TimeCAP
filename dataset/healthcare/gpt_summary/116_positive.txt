Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable decrease in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the overall positivity rate declining from 25.39% to 4.39%. The decline is observed in both Influenza A and B, with Influenza A positivity decreasing from 21.62% to 1.28%, and Influenza B from 3.77% to 3.12%. The highest positivity rates for both strains were recorded in the early weeks, indicating a peak in the flu season, which has since shown a consistent downward trend. This trend suggests a waning influenza season, which could potentially reduce the burden on healthcare resources related to flu treatment and hospitalizations. Despite the decrease, ongoing surveillance remains essential to monitor potential fluctuations in flu activity and to inform public health interventions.
