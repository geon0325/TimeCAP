Over the last 20 weeks, the surveillance of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) has shown a fluctuating trend with the percentage of ILI patients initially below the baseline, followed by a significant increase that surpassed the baseline, and then a gradual decrease towards the end of the period. The highest ratios of ILI were observed in the age groups of 0-4 and 5-24, with the latter age group experiencing the most pronounced spike in ILI cases during the period analyzed. The age group of 65 or more consistently showed the lowest number of ILI cases, suggesting a lower impact on this demographic. After peaking, the ILI ratio has been declining, yet it remains crucial for healthcare providers to monitor these trends closely, as the fluctuations indicate the potential for sudden increases in healthcare demand. The data underscores the importance of maintaining adequate healthcare resources and readiness for ILI, particularly among younger populations, to manage and mitigate the impact of such trends on the healthcare system.
