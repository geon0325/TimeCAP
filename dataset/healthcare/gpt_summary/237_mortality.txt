Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the mortality rate from Influenza or Pneumonia as a proportion of total deaths, with a marked increase from the 20-week average of 7.84% to a peak of 16.83% in week 6, before showing a declining trend until week 10 and then rising again to 15.67% by week 20. The absolute number of deaths attributed to Influenza remained low and relatively stable, whereas deaths from Pneumonia increased significantly, contributing to the overall rise in the mortality ratio. The highest weekly mortality ratio from these causes within the 20-week period was recorded at 16.83%, significantly higher than the average, indicating a potential stress on healthcare resources associated with Pneumonia rather than Influenza. The total number of deaths has also increased over the period, ending 28.4% higher in week 20 compared to week 1. This trend of rising mortality rates alongside increasing total deaths could signal the need for heightened focus on Pneumonia prevention, treatment, and potential contributing factors such as seasonal changes or concurrent health crises.
