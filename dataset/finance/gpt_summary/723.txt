Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a general upward trend, closing higher at 4712.02 from an initial value of 4682.85, despite some volatility and a notable dip around the 10th market day. The VIX indicates increased volatility with a peak around the same period when the S&P 500 dipped, but it ended lower at 18.69, suggesting that market volatility has subsided. International indices like the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 experienced declines, with the Nikkei dropping from 29609.97 to 28437.77 and the FTSE 100 from 7347.90 to 7291.80, which may indicate broader global market concerns. Commodity prices such as Gold Futures and Crude Oil Futures fluctuated, with Gold showing relative stability closing slightly higher at 1782.90, while Crude Oil recovered from a sharp fall mid-period, ending at 71.67 from an opening of 80.79. The currency markets remained relatively stable, with minor fluctuations in EUR/USD and USD/JYP pairs and a slight depreciation of the USD against the CNY from 6.39 to 6.38, suggesting steady Forex markets in the face of equity and commodity movements.
