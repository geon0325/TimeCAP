Over the last 24 hours in Houston, the temperature exhibited a typical diurnal pattern, with a peak during the day and a trough in the early morning hours, indicative of clear skies or minimal cloud cover. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, showing higher values during the cooler morning hours, which is common due to the inverse relationship between temperature and atmospheric moisture capacity. Air pressure maintained a relatively stable trend, with only slight variations, suggesting a stable weather pattern without the presence of significant frontal systems. Wind speeds were mostly gentle to moderate throughout the period, with an increase noted during the late afternoon and evening, which could relate to the development of a localized low-pressure system or the typical increase in wind speeds during the warmest part of the day. The wind direction was predominantly from the south to the southeast, which is typical for Houston and can contribute to humidity transport from the Gulf of Mexico into the area.
