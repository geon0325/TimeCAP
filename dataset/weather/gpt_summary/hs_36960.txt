Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, indicating warmer weather moving into the area as the day progressed. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuation, with a notable decrease towards the latter part of the period, suggesting drier air conditions. Air pressure has been on a steady decline, which could be indicative of an approaching weather system that may alter current conditions. Wind speeds remained relatively light throughout, with some variability in direction, but predominantly from the north, shifting towards the east and briefly to the west before returning to northerly directions. This combination of rising temperatures, lowering humidity, and decreasing pressure accompanied by light and variable winds, points to a stable yet changing weather pattern for Houston.
