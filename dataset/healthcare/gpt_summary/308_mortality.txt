Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, with a peak of 13.74% in week 5, significantly above the average of 7.84%. This peak coincides with an increase in the absolute number of deaths from Influenza, which surged to 152 in the same week, suggesting a potential outbreak. However, subsequent weeks have shown a decrease, with the mortality ratio from these causes dropping to a low of 6.10% by the 20th week, indicating a downward trend. The total number of deaths has also shown a gradual decline over the period, with the initial figure of 70,021 decreasing to 59,588 by the 20th week. This overall decrease in both total mortality and the proportion attributable to Influenza or Pneumonia could imply an easing burden on healthcare services related to these illnesses.
