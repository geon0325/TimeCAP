Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the mortality attributable to influenza and pneumonia, with the percentage of deaths due to these causes initially staying below the 20-week average of 7.84%, then showing a dramatic increase mid-period to a peak of 14.15%, followed by a gradual decline towards the end. The absolute number of deaths from influenza spiked significantly in the 17th week, with 887 deaths compared to an average of 48 deaths in the preceding weeks, suggesting a possible outbreak or a change in reporting. Pneumonia-related deaths also increased mid-period, with the highest numbers recorded in weeks 14 through 16, aligning with the peak in the percentage of total deaths. The subsequent decline in the ratio of mortality due to influenza or pneumonia towards the end of the 20-week period indicates a possible easing of the situation. Nevertheless, the healthcare system might have experienced increased strain during the weeks of heightened influenza and pneumonia mortality, which could have implications for resource allocation and preparedness for potential future outbreaks.
