Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown moderate fluctuations with a slight downward trend, closing lower on the last day than its starting point. Volatility, as measured by the VIX, increased notably amidst market fluctuations, peaking at 27.59, which suggests increased market uncertainty during the observed period. The Nikkei 225 demonstrated resilience with an upward movement, recovering from a low mid-period, which may indicate a stronger performance in the Japanese market relative to the U.S. market. Gold Futures saw a general uptrend in price, suggesting a flight to safety by investors amid the volatility in equity markets. Both crude oil futures and major currency pairs, including EUR/USD and USD/JPY, experienced some volatility, but ended the period near their starting points, which could indicate a period of market consolidation and uncertainty regarding future economic conditions.
