Over the past 20 weeks, the total number of respiratory specimens tested for influenza has fluctuated, with a decrease observed from week 1 (20,167 specimens) to week 9 (9,132 specimens), followed by a steady increase through week 20 (13,366 specimens). The ratio of positive specimens peaked at 4.82% in week 1 and reached its lowest at 1.90% in week 8, with a general declining trend in the first half of the period and a slight increase towards the end, resulting in an overall average positivity ratio of 6.26%. Influenza A showed a decreasing positivity rate from 3.14% in week 1 to 1.02% in week 9, with a slight rebound to 1.14% by week 20, while Influenza B displayed a more variable trend with the highest positivity rate of 2.10% in week 18. The ratio of positive specimens for Influenza B exceeded that of Influenza A from week 14 onwards, suggesting a shift in the predominant influenza strain in the tested population. This data indicates a need for ongoing surveillance and resource allocation for influenza testing and vaccination programs, as fluctuations in influenza strain predominance and positivity rates could impact healthcare system preparedness and response strategies.
