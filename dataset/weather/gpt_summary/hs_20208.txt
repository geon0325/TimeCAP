Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a gradual decrease in temperature, indicating a cooling trend as we moved through the period. Humidity levels have shown an increase, reaching saturation towards the end of the time frame, which could be indicative of potential fog formation or precipitation. The air pressure has remained relatively stable, with a slight increase towards the end of the period, suggesting stable weather conditions may persist. Wind speeds were moderate and consistent, with a slight increase in the middle of the period, which could enhance the wind chill factor, making it feel cooler than the actual temperature. Finally, the wind direction has been predominantly from the east, with some variability, which is typical for coastal areas like Houston and can contribute to moisture transport from the Gulf of Mexico.
