Over the last 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual rise in temperature, starting from below freezing and reaching more temperate conditions. Humidity levels have fluctuated significantly throughout the period, with notable dips coinciding with the peaks in temperature, suggesting a correlation between temperature and moisture content in the air. Air pressure has been relatively stable, maintaining a consistent level, with a slight increase during the peak temperature hours, indicating a high-pressure system possibly influencing the area. Wind speeds have been mostly light to moderate, with a noticeable increase towards the end of the period, which could contribute to wind chill effects and the dispersion of any atmospheric pollutants. The wind has predominantly come from a westerly direction, shifting slightly to the south-west and back to the west, which is typical for this region and may impact coastal conditions and temperature distribution within the city.
