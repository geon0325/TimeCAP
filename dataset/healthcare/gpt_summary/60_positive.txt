Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant increase in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the ratio of positive specimens rising from 3.32% to a peak of 24.73% before decreasing to 12.74%. Influenza A has been more prevalent than Influenza B throughout the timeframe, but the gap between the two has been closing, with Influenza B peaking at a higher ratio of positive specimens (11.26%) compared to its earlier weeks. Notably, the percentage of positive specimens for both types of influenza reached its highest point in the middle of the period and has since been on a declining trend. Despite the overall decline in recent weeks, the ratios of positive specimens for both Influenza A and B remain above the 20-week average ratio of 6.26%, suggesting continued circulation of the virus in the population. Healthcare systems should remain alert and prepared for influenza cases, with a particular focus on the potential impact of Influenza B, which has shown a significant increase in the latter half of the observed period.
