Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in the mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia in relation to total deaths, with the ratio peaking at 10.89% in week 5 and declining to 6.15% by week 20. Despite the decline in recent weeks, the peak ratio significantly exceeds the average ratio of 7.84%, indicating a period of heightened mortality likely due to seasonal trends or possibly an outbreak. The absolute number of deaths attributed to Influenza and Pneumonia also shows a decreasing trend from their respective peaks in week 4 for Influenza (1536 deaths) and week 5 for Pneumonia (5583 deaths). However, both the number of deaths from Influenza and Pneumonia and the mortality ratio have not returned to the baseline, suggesting a sustained impact on the healthcare system. This analysis underscores the importance of continued surveillance and potentially increased healthcare resources to manage and mitigate the effects of respiratory illnesses on public health.
