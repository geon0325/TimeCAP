The time-series data for Influenza-like Illness (ILI) over the last 20 weeks indicates a declining trend in the percentage of ILI patients, with the ratio dropping below the baseline of 2.9% in recent weeks. Despite a peak in ILI activity, which was considerably above the baseline and reflected a high burden of illness, the current downward trend suggests a significant decrease in ILI cases across all age groups. The most substantial reductions have been observed in the youngest age group (0-4 years), which initially had the highest numbers, and now records much lower levels, indicating a potentially reduced spread of ILI in this demographic. Although the reduction in ILI cases is a positive development, healthcare systems must remain vigilant as the current ratio is still above the threshold in some age groups and could indicate continued circulation of the virus. Given the observed trends, healthcare providers should continue to monitor ILI activity closely and encourage preventive measures, especially among vulnerable populations, to maintain control over the spread of ILI.
