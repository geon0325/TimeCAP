Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have experienced a slight fluctuation, with a general trend of cooling overnight followed by a gradual warming during the day. Humidity levels remained high throughout the period, reaching saturation at several points, which could have contributed to foggy conditions, particularly in the early morning hours. Atmospheric pressure was relatively stable, indicating a period of settled weather without significant fronts or storm systems affecting the area. Wind speeds were light to moderate and increased slightly towards the end of the observed period, with wind directions shifting from predominantly westerly to northwesterly. This consistency in wind behavior suggests a steady marine influence on the city's weather pattern, typical for San Franciscoâ€™s climate.
