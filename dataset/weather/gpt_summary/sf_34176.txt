Atmospheric pressure has remained fairly stable, suggesting a period of consistent weather conditions without the immediate influence of any strong weather systems. Wind speeds have varied, ranging from calm to moderately breezy conditions, with the most notable increase in wind speed occurring in the most recent hours.
