Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have experienced a moderate fluctuation, with a general cooling trend during the early hours and a subsequent gradual increase towards the latter part of the time series. Humidity levels remained high for most of the period, suggesting a consistently moist air mass over the city, although there was a slight decrease towards the end of the observed timeframe. Air pressure was relatively stable, with only a minor decrease, indicating a period of settled weather without significant front movements or storm systems affecting the area. Wind speeds varied, with stronger winds occurring earlier in the period and lighter winds later on, which could influence the dispersal of fog and maritime air, common features in San Francisco's microclimate. Lastly, the wind direction was predominantly from the west and varied slightly, typical for coastal locations in the region, which may bring in cooler oceanic air, affecting local temperatures and fog formation.
