Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature, with a general trend of cooling followed by a moderate increase and then a gradual decrease again. Relative humidity showed a significant decrease during the day, indicative of drier air moving into the area. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight increase towards the end of the period, which could signal more settled weather conditions. Wind speeds varied modestly, predominantly in the light breeze category, but there was a notable shift in wind direction from southerly to northerly and then easterly, suggesting the passage of a weather front through the city. The combination of these factors points towards a transition in weather patterns, which could lead to changes in temperature and possibly clearer skies following the frontal passage.
