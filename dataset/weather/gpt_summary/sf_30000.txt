Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have remained relatively steady with minor fluctuations, indicating a stable weather pattern with no extreme variations. Humidity levels have experienced a significant decline, starting very high and dropping markedly, suggesting a drying trend that could be associated with the passage of a weather front. Air pressure has shown some variability, with a notable drop followed by a sharp increase, which could be indicative of changing weather systems moving through the area. Wind speeds have been moderate, with occasional gusts, and wind direction has been predominantly from the south, shifting significantly towards the west in the latest observations. This combination of changing humidity, pressure trends, and wind shifts suggests that San Francisco may be experiencing a transition in weather patterns, potentially leading to clearer and less humid conditions.
