Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant fluctuation in respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a peak positivity ratio of 30.26% in week 13, preceded by a steady increase from the base average of 6.26%. The ratio of positive specimens for Influenza A reached its highest at 19.31% in week 14, while Influenza B topped at 17.59% in week 7, indicating that Influenza A became more prevalent as the season progressed. However, there has been a notable decline in recent weeks, with the positivity ratio for all specimens dropping to 2.32% by week 20, with Influenza A and B also showing marked decreases to 1.70% and 0.63%, respectively. This declining trend suggests a decrease in influenza activity, which could ease the burden on healthcare systems in terms of resource allocation for testing, treatment, and hospitalization. Nonetheless, the earlier high rates of infection highlight the necessity for continued surveillance and preparedness measures, especially during peak influenza seasons.
