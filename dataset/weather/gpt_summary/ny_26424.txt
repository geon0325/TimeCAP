Over the past 24 hours in New York City, temperatures have exhibited a typical diurnal pattern, with a gradual increase from the early morning hours, reaching a peak in the afternoon before declining towards the evening. Relative humidity levels started relatively high and saw a significant increase, reaching saturation at one point, which could have been associated with fog or mist, before decreasing again later in the day. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively steady, indicating stable weather conditions without the presence of significant frontal systems passing through the area. Wind speed varied modestly but included a period of increased velocity, suggesting a brief interval of gustier conditions. Meanwhile, wind direction was variable, with a notable shift from predominantly northwesterly to a southerly direction and then veering to easterly, which could influence the movement of weather systems and potentially bring changes in weather conditions, such as temperature and humidity, in the near future.
