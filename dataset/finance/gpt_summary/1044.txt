Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with a slight downward trend, starting at 3970.04 and closing at 3948.72, indicating potential investor uncertainty. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, has generally remained elevated, fluctuating between 19.59 and 26.52, which corroborates the observed instability in the stock market. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have both experienced declines, with the FTSE 100 showing a sharp drop from 7878.70 to 7499.60, reflecting broader global market concerns. Gold Futures have increased from 1808.80 to 1993.80, suggesting a flight to safety among investors during this period of heightened market uncertainty. Exchange rates have seen the USD strengthen against the JPY but weaken against the EUR and remain relatively stable against the CNY, which could influence multinational trade flows and earnings repatriation.
