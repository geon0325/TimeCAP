Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced a gradual increase in temperature, which suggests a warming trend. However, humidity levels fluctuated significantly, reaching saturation at one point, indicating the possibility of fog or precipitation during that time. Air pressure showed a notable peak, followed by a decrease, which could be associated with the passing of a weather front. Wind speeds varied moderately with a noticeable increase mid-period, suggesting a breezy condition that could have influenced wind chill factors, affecting how cold the air felt. Wind direction was predominantly westerly, with a major shift towards northerly and then easterly winds in the latter hours, which could bring changes in weather patterns, possibly cooler air from those directions.
