Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there was a noticeable decrease in temperature during the early morning hours, which then gradually increased throughout the day, indicating a typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, reaching their peak in the late evening which could contribute to a higher chance of morning fog, especially with the proximity to the ocean. Air pressure experienced a sharp decline in the most recent hours, suggesting the possible approach of a weather system that could lead to precipitation or a change in weather patterns. Wind speeds varied, with a period of calm winds around midday, but ended the period with an increase, which could signal the onset of a more active weather phase. The wind direction was predominantly westerly but showed variability, including a brief southerly shift, and ended with a consistent flow from the north, which is likely to influence local weather conditions, possibly bringing cooler and drier air.
