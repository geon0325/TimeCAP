Over the last 20 weeks, there has been an upward trend in the percentage of deaths attributable to influenza or pneumonia, starting from below the 20-week average of 7.84% and reaching a peak of 7.64% in week 14. Notably, there was a significant increase in influenza-related deaths from week 11 onwards, with a dramatic rise from 141 to 655 deaths, which coincides with a spike in the mortality ratio. Pneumonia deaths have shown a more consistent pattern, but still demonstrate an increase, particularly in weeks 11 and 12, where deaths rose to over 4,000 cases each week. This trend is concerning as it suggests an escalation in the incidence or severity of these respiratory diseases, which could strain healthcare resources and indicate a potential public health issue. The data implies the need for heightened surveillance, increased vaccination efforts, and preparedness in healthcare settings to manage a growing burden of respiratory illness-related mortality.
