Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a slight declining trend in the total number of deaths, fluctuating around an average of approximately 52,000 deaths per week. However, deaths from influenza and pneumonia have not mirrored this trend consistently, with pneumonia deaths showing a slight increase, culminating in a rise from 2864 in the first week to 3143 in the final week, and influenza-related deaths exhibiting a more pronounced increase in the latter weeks, from 13 to 26. Despite the fluctuations in total deaths, the percentage of deaths attributed to influenza or pneumonia has generally increased, from an initial 5.50% to a peak of 5.79% in the last week. This gradual increase in the ratio of influenza and pneumonia-related deaths suggests a growing impact of these respiratory conditions on overall mortality. Healthcare systems may need to consider bolstering resources to handle potential surges in influenza and pneumonia cases, as indicated by the rising trend in mortality rates from these illnesses.
