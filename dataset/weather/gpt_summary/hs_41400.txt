Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before stabilizing. Humidity levels have shown significant variation, with a notable spike to full saturation in the early morning hours, indicative of possible fog or mist formation, before tapering off as temperatures rose. Air pressure has been relatively steady, with a slight increasing trend throughout the day, which could suggest stable weather conditions are prevailing. Wind speeds have been mostly light to moderate, with some increase in the evening, and the prevailing winds have been predominantly from the south to southeast, which is typical for Houston and could contribute to the warm, moist air influencing the local weather. The combination of high humidity and rising temperatures throughout the day may lead to the development of heat-related weather phenomena or thunderstorm activity, particularly if there is sufficient atmospheric instability.
