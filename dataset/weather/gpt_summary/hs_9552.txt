Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature experienced a moderate fluctuation, beginning with cooler conditions that gradually warmed up, particularly in the late afternoon and early evening, suggesting a typical diurnal temperature variation. Relative humidity levels remained fairly high throughout the period, indicating a level of atmospheric moisture that could contribute to a feeling of mugginess or the potential for morning fog development. Air pressure showed a slight decreasing trend, which could be indicative of a gradual approach of a weather system that may affect local conditions in the near future. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, increasing towards the end of the observed period, which could enhance the wind chill factor slightly or contribute to the dispersal of any localized air pollutants. Wind directions were mostly easterly to southeasterly, which in Houston can often bring increased moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, possibly affecting local humidity and cloud cover.
