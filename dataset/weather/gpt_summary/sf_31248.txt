Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a moderate fluctuation in temperature with a general cooling trend during the night followed by a warming trend in the afternoon. Humidity levels saw a significant increase during the early morning hours, indicative of possible fog development, which is common in this coastal city, but then decreased as the day progressed. Atmospheric pressure experienced a notable peak in the afternoon, suggesting the transient influence of a high-pressure system which could lead to clearer skies and calmer weather conditions. Wind speeds varied, with a period of stronger gusts around midday that could have resulted in cooler perceived temperatures and the dispersal of any morning fog. Wind direction was predominantly from the west-northwest, typical for San Francisco's oceanic climate, which brings in cool marine air from the Pacific Ocean.
