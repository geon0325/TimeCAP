Over the last 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have seen a gradual increase, reaching a peak in the latter part of the period before stabilizing. Relative humidity levels exhibited notable fluctuations with a peak around the middle of the time series, potentially indicating the passage of a moisture front through the area. Air pressure was largely stable in the early hours but experienced a significant drop later on, which could signal an approaching weather system that may affect conditions in the near future. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate and decreased to calm conditions at times, with occasional periods of no wind, suggesting a relatively stable air mass over the city for much of the period. The wind direction was predominantly westerly, with some variability, including a brief shift to southerly and easterly directions, which may have contributed to changes in temperature and humidity observed in the data.
