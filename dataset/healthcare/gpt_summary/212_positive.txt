Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the number of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a general upward trend peaking around week 15, followed by a decline. The ratio of positive specimens surged from an initial 3.06% to a high of 30.26% in week 15, before falling to 15.81% by week 20, indicating a significant wave of influenza activity. Influenza A has been the predominant strain with its peak ratio of positive specimens reaching 19.31% in week 16, subsequently decreasing to 12.20% by week 20, whereas Influenza B showed a similar pattern but with a lower peak ratio of 17.59% in week 10. The weekly numbers of specimens tested have consistently increased, peaking at 74,416 in week 20, which may reflect heightened surveillance and testing due to the increase in influenza cases. The observed trends suggest a substantial demand on healthcare resources during the peak weeks, potentially straining systems with increased patient loads and necessitating continued monitoring and preparedness for influenza management.
