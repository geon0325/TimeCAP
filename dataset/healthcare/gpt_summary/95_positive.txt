Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable increase in the ratio of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a significant upward trend from 1.95% to 15.35%. Influenza A has shown a more pronounced growth in positivity compared to Influenza B, escalating from 1.43% to 12.96%, while Influenza B increased from 0.52% to 2.40%. The week-over-week data reveal that the increase in positive cases is accelerating, with the last week showing the highest jump in positivity rates for both Influenza A and B. This rise, particularly in Influenza A, could indicate the onset of a more aggressive flu season, potentially leading to increased hospitalizations and a burden on healthcare resources. Public health entities must prepare for a potential surge in demand for medical care and consider bolstering vaccination and prevention efforts to mitigate the impact.
