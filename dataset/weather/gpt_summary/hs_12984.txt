Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, indicative of a warming trend. Humidity levels showed variations with periods of higher moisture, particularly towards the latter part of the day which could have implications for comfort levels and an increased likelihood of precipitation. Air pressure has been on a slow decline throughout the period, which is often associated with the approach of a weather system that could bring changing conditions. Wind speed has been mostly moderate but showed some increase later in the period, suggesting the potential for windy conditions to develop. The wind direction has been predominantly from the southeast to south, which is typical for bringing in warmer and more humid air from the Gulf of Mexico to the Houston area.
