The VIX, commonly known as the "fear index," has risen in the last day to 21.57, after generally trending downwards, suggesting a recent spike in market volatility. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have exhibited relative stability with a slight upward bias, indicating some resilience in global markets despite the volatility in U.S. stocks. Gold Futures have declined from 1805.00 to 1781.60, reflecting a decrease in safe-haven demand, whereas Crude Oil Futures experienced a noticeable downtrend from 71.91 to 65.46, which could imply expectations of reduced economic activity or increased supply. Exchange rates have seen minor fluctuations, with the Euro and the Japanese Yen weakening against the USD, while the Chinese Yuan remained relatively stable, suggesting nuanced shifts in currency markets that could impact international trade dynamics.
