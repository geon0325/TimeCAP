Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has displayed a rising trend, indicating warmer weather conditions as the day progressed. Humidity levels remained relatively high throughout the period, suggesting a muggy atmosphere, although there was a slight decrease during the warmest part of the day. Air pressure experienced some fluctuations, with a notable decrease towards the latter part of the time series, which could signal an approaching change in weather patterns, such as the possibility of a frontal system. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate and showed an increase during the day, potentially contributing to some relief from the high humidity. The wind direction was predominantly from the south to the south-southeast, which is typical for Houston and can be associated with warm, moist air being drawn in from the Gulf of Mexico.
