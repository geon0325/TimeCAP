Over the past 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown significant volatility, with an initial upward trend peaking at 4176.82, followed by a notable decline to a low of 3666.77, before partially recovering to 3818.83, reflecting investor uncertainty and potential market stress. The VIX, commonly known as the "fear index," has correspondingly fluctuated, with an upward spike to 34.02, indicating increased market volatility and risk aversion, before settling slightly lower at 28.16. International equity markets have mirrored this sentiment, with Japan's Nikkei 225 experiencing a decline from 27457.89 to 26804.60 and the UK's FTSE 100 also decreasing from 7533.00 to 7312.30, suggesting a global risk-off environment. Commodity prices have seen mixed movements; Gold Futures have generally trended downwards from 1843.30 to 1813.70, showing investors' cautious stance, while Crude Oil Futures have decreased from a high of 122.11 to 109.78, possibly reflecting concerns over global demand. Currency markets have been relatively stable with slight fluctuations in major pairs, but the overall trend indicates a marginally weaker dollar against the Euro and Japanese Yen, and a stable exchange rate against the Chinese Yuan over the period.
