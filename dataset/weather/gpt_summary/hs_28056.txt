Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature with a noticeable peak during the later hours, suggesting a warm day after a relatively cooler morning. Humidity levels showed significant variation, reaching full saturation at one point, which could have led to foggy conditions or dew, then decreasing as temperatures rose. Air pressure fluctuations were observed, with a notable drop followed by a recovery, which could indicate the passage of a transient weather system through the area. Wind speeds varied, with an increase towards the evening, possibly bringing in fresher air or affecting local wind chill. The wind direction remained primarily from the south to southeast, consistent with the region's typical weather patterns and possibly contributing to the temperature rise.
