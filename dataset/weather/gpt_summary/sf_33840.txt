Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a noticeable diurnal temperature variation, with a peak in the late afternoon and a substantial drop during the nighttime, which is typical for this coastal city. The humidity levels were relatively low during the day but showed a significant increase overnight, suggesting the presence of marine influence, particularly with the onset of evening fog or low clouds that are common in this region. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period with only minor fluctuations, indicating no immediate approach of significant weather systems.

Wind speeds were generally light and variable, which is characteristic of San Francisco's microclimates, and could contribute to localized variations in temperature and fog dispersal. Wind direction shifted throughout the day, but there was no dominant wind pattern, suggesting that local topography and coastal influences had a more significant impact on wind behavior than larger-scale weather systems.
