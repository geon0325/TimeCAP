The analysis of the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data over the last 20 weeks indicates a fluctuating but overall increasing trend in the number of ILI cases among all age groups, with the most significant rise observed in the youngest age group (0-4 years). Despite the increase in raw numbers, the ratio of ILI patients to total patients has remained below the baseline threshold of 2.9%, suggesting that the overall increase in patient volume is outpacing the growth in ILI cases. Notably, the proportion of ILI cases among the older population (65 years and above) has been relatively stable, which may suggest higher resilience or lower exposure in this demographic, or potentially higher levels of vaccination. However, the increasing trend in ILI cases, particularly in younger age groups, could signal the onset of a more active influenza season, necessitating preparedness in healthcare resources and potential public health interventions. It is essential for healthcare providers to monitor these trends closely to manage resources effectively and to consider public health messaging around prevention strategies, including vaccination and hygiene practices.
