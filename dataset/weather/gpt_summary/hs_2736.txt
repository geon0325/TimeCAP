Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature exhibited a typical diurnal pattern, with a noticeable increase during the daytime, followed by a gradual decline at night. Relative humidity levels were inversely correlated with temperature changes, peaking during the cooler night and early morning hours, indicative of a high likelihood of morning fog or dew. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable, indicating a period of steady weather without significant fronts or weather systems passing through the area. Wind speeds varied minimally, with a period of calm around dawn, and a slight increase later in the day, while wind directions shifted from southeasterly to southerly, then to southwesterly, suggesting a potential for warm, moist air influencing local weather conditions. Overall, the combination of high humidity, stable pressure, and gentle winds points towards settled weather with possible morning humidity-related phenomena and warm afternoons.
