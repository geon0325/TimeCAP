Over the last 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have experienced a slight fluctuation with a tendency to increase marginally toward the end of the period. Humidity levels have shown significant variability, reaching saturation at certain points, which could indicate the presence or recent passing of fog or precipitation. Air pressure readings dipped in the middle of the time series but have since shown relative stability, suggesting a transient weather system may have moved through the area. Wind speeds have been mostly light to moderate, with a notable increase at one point, which might have coincided with the lower air pressure readings. The wind has been predominantly coming from the south to the southeast, with a brief shift to northeasterly winds, potentially influencing localized weather patterns such as fog dispersal along the coast.
