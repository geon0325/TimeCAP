Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before starting to decline slightly in the evening. Humidity levels have shown variability, with a notable drop during the hottest part of the day, indicative of the discomfort one might feel due to the combination of high temperatures and moderate humidity. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with only minor fluctuations, which suggests a period of settled weather without significant frontal activity. Wind speeds were generally light but increased during the evening, which could have provided some relief from the day's heat. The wind direction shifted throughout the day, starting from a southerly direction, moving to a westerly and finally to an easterly direction by the end of the period, indicating the passage of weather systems and the potential for changing weather conditions.
