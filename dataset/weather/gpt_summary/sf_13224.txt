Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperature has displayed a typical diurnal pattern with a noticeable increase during the daytime and a decrease at night. Humidity levels have fluctuated but generally maintained high values, indicating a relatively moist air mass over the area which could contribute to cloud formation or fog, especially in the early morning or late evening. Air pressure experienced a significant drop in the afternoon, which is often associated with the approach of a weather system that could lead to changing weather conditions, including the possibility of precipitation or windier conditions. Wind speeds have varied, with stronger winds occurring in the earlier part of the period and calming towards the latter part, but a shift in wind direction from westerly to northerly could suggest an incoming change in weather patterns. Overall, the combination of high humidity, decreasing pressure, and changing wind direction suggests that San Francisco might be on the verge of experiencing more dynamic weather, potentially including increased cloudiness or a chance of rain.
