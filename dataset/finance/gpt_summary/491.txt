Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a general upward trend, closing higher by approximately 3.7% from 3663.46 to 3799.61, reflecting a positive sentiment among investors. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, has experienced fluctuations but ended slightly higher, indicating that while there has been some uncertainty, overall market volatility has not increased significantly. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have both seen gains, with the Nikkei showing a particularly strong performance, rising by about 5.5%, which suggests robustness in Asian markets and potential confidence in global economic recovery. Commodity prices have been mixed, with Gold Futures retreating about 0.5% amid a risk-on environment, while Crude Oil Futures have increased by over 12%, possibly due to expectations of economic recovery enhancing demand. Finally, the currency markets have been relatively stable with minor fluctuations in the EUR/USD and USD/CNY exchange rates, but the USD/JPY has appreciated, indicating a slight strengthening of the US dollar against the Japanese yen.
