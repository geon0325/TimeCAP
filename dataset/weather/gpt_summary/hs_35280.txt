Humidity levels experienced a marked rise overnight, peaking towards the early morning hours, which could have led to a feeling of increased mugginess or potential for morning fog.

Wind speeds were mostly light but picked up later on, indicating a slight change in weather patterns that might affect wind chill or disperse atmospheric pollutants.
