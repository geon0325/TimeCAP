Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced a slight upward trend in temperature, indicating a warm and potentially humid day ahead. Humidity levels remained consistently high for the majority of the period, which could contribute to a muggy feeling in the air, although there was a noticeable dip in humidity later in the day that may have offered some respite. Air pressure showed a gradual decreasing trend, which is often associated with the approach of a weather system that could result in precipitation or storms. Wind speeds varied but were generally light to moderate, with a significant shift in wind direction observed, suggesting a change in the weather pattern. The combination of high humidity, decreasing air pressure, and changing wind patterns could signify the potential for unsettled weather conditions in the near future.
