Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a noticeable dip in temperature during the early hours, followed by a significant increase in the afternoon, indicative of diurnal variation typical for the region. Humidity levels remained high during the cooler morning hours but dropped sharply as temperatures rose, suggesting the presence of drier air moving into the area. Air pressure saw a dramatic increase in the afternoon, possibly signaling the influence of a high-pressure system that could lead to more stable weather conditions. Wind speeds varied, with a notable peak that could be associated with a passing weather front, and the wind direction shifted throughout the day, starting predominantly southerly before transitioning to a more northerly and westerly direction, and then finally shifting back towards southerly, reflecting changing weather systems in the vicinity. Overall, these fluctuations in weather indicators suggest a dynamic weather pattern with variations in temperature and humidity, influenced by changing wind directions and the strengthening of a high-pressure system.
