Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable uptick in the proportion of deaths attributed to influenza or pneumonia, with the ratio of mortality from these causes to total deaths rising from 5.39% to 6.83%. This represents an increase of 1.44 percentage points from the beginning to the end of the observed period, surpassing the average ratio of mortality of 7.84%. The absolute number of deaths due to influenza or pneumonia combined has also increased, with pneumonia deaths rising from 2695 to 3782, and influenza-related deaths growing from 4 to 46. This trend suggests a worsening severity or spread of these respiratory diseases. Such a pattern may indicate a need for heightened surveillance, prevention, and treatment measures in the healthcare system to address the growing impact of these illnesses.
