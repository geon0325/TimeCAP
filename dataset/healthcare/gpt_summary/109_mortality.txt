Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia to the total number of deaths has generally trended downward, with occasional fluctuations, from a high of 7.75% in week 6 to a low of 5.60% in week 19, compared to the historical average of 7.84%. The total number of deaths fluctuated slightly but remained relatively stable with the lowest at 52,272 in week 20 and the highest at 58,529 in week 5. Notably, deaths from influenza have shown a significant decreasing trend, from 367 in week 1 to just 13 in week 20, which may indicate a waning influenza season or effective public health interventions. However, deaths from pneumonia have not demonstrated a similarly sharp decline, with numbers only gradually decreasing from 3,896 in week 2 to 2,952 in week 20. The overall declining ratio of mortality from these respiratory conditions could alleviate some pressures on healthcare resources but warrants continuous monitoring for potential resurgences and implications on public health policy.
