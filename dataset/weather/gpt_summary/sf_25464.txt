Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperature has exhibited a typical diurnal pattern, with a peak during the daytime and a gradual decrease through the night into the early morning hours. Humidity levels have fluctuated considerably, reaching high levels typical of coastal regions and suggesting the possibility of fog or mist, especially when coupled with the lower temperatures and higher humidity in the early hours. Air pressure has been steadily increasing, indicating a potential shift towards more stable and clearer weather conditions. Wind speeds have been mostly light to moderate, with no significant gusts reported, which is common for the region and should not have a major impact on daily activities. The wind direction has been variable, with a tendency to shift from northerly to westerly, then to southerly, which could influence local temperature and fog distribution along the coast and in the bay area.
