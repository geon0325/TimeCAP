The VIX, often referred to as the "fear index," has remained relatively low with minor fluctuations, ending slightly higher at 12.29 from an initial 12.86, which suggests a stable market with low volatility expectations. Internationally, Japan's Nikkei 225 also reflected growth, moving from 23292.65 to 24066.12, while the UK's FTSE 100 showed substantial gains particularly in the last two days, jumping from a low of 7158.80 to 7525.30, possibly indicating increased investor confidence or reactions to domestic or geopolitical events. Commodity markets saw Gold Futures remaining relatively stable, hinting at a steady demand for safe-haven assets, whereas Crude Oil Futures experienced an overall increase from 55.21 to 60.94, which could imply rising energy demands or geopolitical tensions affecting supply. Currency markets indicated a slight strengthening of the USD against the CNY, going from 7.03 to 6.98, while EUR/USD and USD/JPY exchange rates showed minor volatility, ending near their starting points, which may reflect a wait-and-see approach among Forex traders.
