Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced relatively stable temperatures with a slight fluctuation, remaining within a narrow range that indicates consistent weather conditions without any significant warming or cooling trends. Humidity levels have been high, gradually increasing throughout the period, suggesting the presence of considerable moisture in the air, which could lead to a feeling of mugginess and potentially contribute to the development of fog or light rain. Air pressure has shown a steady decline, which is indicative of an approaching weather system that could disrupt the current stable conditions, possibly leading to changes in weather patterns such as increased cloudiness or precipitation. Wind speeds have been mostly moderate without any drastic changes, maintaining a gentle to fresh breeze, which could aid in dispersal of any localized air pollutants. Wind direction has been predominantly from the southeast, which is typical for Houston and can contribute to the transport of moist air from the Gulf of Mexico, reinforcing the high humidity levels observed.
