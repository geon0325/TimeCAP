Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant upward trend in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with an average positive rate of 6.26%. The data shows a marked increase in positivity from 1.78% in week 1 to 24.15% in week 20, indicating a substantial rise in influenza activity. Notably, Influenza A has been the predominant strain, with its positivity rate growing from 1.00% to 20.21% over the period, while Influenza B also showed an increase but to a lesser extent, from 0.78% to 3.94%. The growing rates of infection, particularly the sharp rise from 6.68% in week 11 to over 20% in the final weeks, suggest a significant burden on the healthcare system, potentially leading to increased hospitalizations, a strain on healthcare resources, and a heightened need for public health interventions. The data underscores the importance of continuous monitoring, vaccine promotion, and preparedness in healthcare settings to manage the increasing influenza incidence.
