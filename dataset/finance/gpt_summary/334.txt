Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 exhibited a general uptrend, starting at 2912.43 and closing higher at 3029.73, suggesting growing investor confidence despite intermittent volatility. This positive sentiment is somewhat contradicted by the VIX, which despite a slight decrease from 34.15 to 28.59, remains elevated, indicating ongoing market uncertainty. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 also showed an upward trend, closing at 21916.31 and 6218.80 respectively, pointing towards a global recovery sentiment. Both Gold and Crude Oil Futures experienced volatility with Gold closing slightly higher at 1713.30 from an opening of 1684.20, indicating its status as a safe-haven asset during uncertain times, while Crude Oil showed a more significant recovery from 18.84 to 33.71, possibly reflecting anticipation of increased demand. Currency markets saw the EUR/USD and USD/JPY pairs remaining relatively stable with a slight appreciation of the Euro and the Yen against the Dollar, while the USD/CNY experienced a slight depreciation of the Dollar from 7.08 to 7.17, which could imply concerns over the US economic outlook in relation to China's recovery.
