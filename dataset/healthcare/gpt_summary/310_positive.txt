Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a peak of 6.23% in week 14, followed by a decline to 2.03% by week 20. Influenza A has been the dominant strain, reaching a high of 6.17% positivity in week 14 before decreasing to 1.98% by week 20, while Influenza B has remained a smaller proportion of the positives, peaking at 0.08% and ending at 0.05% in the final week. The highest number of specimens tested occurred in week 16, with 147,040 tests, coinciding with the peak period of Influenza A activity. Despite the overall decline in positivity rates toward the end of the 20-week period, the average positivity ratio of 6.26% suggests a significant burden on the healthcare system, with implications for resource allocation, especially during peak weeks of influenza activity. The data underscores the importance of continued surveillance and potential interventions such as vaccination campaigns to manage the impact of seasonal influenza on public health.
