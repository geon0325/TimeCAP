Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable upward trend in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the overall ratio of positive specimens peaking at 23.65% in week 15, before declining to 13.24% by week 20. Influenza A is the predominant strain, reaching a peak positivity of 18.16% in the same week as the overall peak, but then decreasing to 6.95% in the last week. However, the ratio of Influenza B specimens has shown a less pronounced decrease, maintaining a relatively high positivity rate of 6.29% in week 20, despite Influenza A's decline. This indicates a shift in the prevalence between the strains, with Influenza B becoming a more significant proportion of positive cases towards the end of the 20-week period. These trends suggest that healthcare systems should remain vigilant for both strains of influenza, but may need to adapt their resources and strategies as the relative prevalence of the strains continues to evolve.
