Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable increase in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a rise from 1.21% in week 1 to 4.87% in week 20, surpassing the average positivity rate of 6.26%. The number of specimens tested weekly has also increased significantly, starting at 30,289 in week 1 and reaching 100,657 by week 20, indicating a possible escalation in respiratory illness surveillance or outbreak severity. Influenza A has shown a more pronounced increase in positivity than Influenza B, going from a 0.88% positivity rate to 3.62%, suggesting it is the predominant strain in circulation. The rise in Influenza B is also noteworthy, with its positivity rate growing from 0.32% to 1.24% over the same period. This trend suggests an increasing burden on the healthcare system, likely requiring enhanced resource allocation for the management and treatment of influenza cases.
