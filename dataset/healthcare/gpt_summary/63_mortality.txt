Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable decline in the ratio of mortality due to Influenza or Pneumonia when compared to the total number of deaths, with the percentage decreasing from 7.42% to 5.26%. This trend suggests an improvement in the management or a seasonal reduction of these respiratory conditions. The absolute number of deaths from pneumonia has also decreased from 3793 to 2661, complementing the decline observed in the mortality ratio. However, the number of deaths attributed specifically to influenza has seen a more variable, yet overall significant decline, from 345 to 4. Given these observations, it may be inferred that healthcare interventions and seasonal factors could be positively impacting the mortality rates from these illnesses, which could alleviate some of the burden on healthcare resources dedicated to these conditions.
