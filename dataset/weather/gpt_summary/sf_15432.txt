Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a modest decline in temperature, followed by a gradual increase towards the latter part of the period, indicating a typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuation, increasing notably during the cooler early hours, which is common as cooler air holds less moisture leading to a higher relative humidity, and then decreasing as temperatures rose again. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight downward trend, suggesting stable weather conditions but with a possible change developing. Wind speeds were consistently light throughout the period, indicating calm weather conditions. The wind direction varied but primarily came from the south to southwest, which in San Francisco is often associated with a milder and more humid air mass moving in from the Pacific Ocean.
