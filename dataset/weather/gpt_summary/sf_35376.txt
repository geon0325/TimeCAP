Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature with a general trend of cooling followed by a modest warming period. Humidity levels remained high throughout the day, suggesting a persistently moist air mass over the city, with a brief dip in humidity which did not last long before returning to higher levels. Air pressure has been gradually decreasing, indicating a potential change in the weather pattern that could lead to increased cloudiness or precipitation. Wind speeds have seen a gradual increase over the day, with the wind direction shifting from southerly to southwesterly, which may bring in cooler ocean air. The combination of high humidity, decreasing pressure, and increasing wind speeds could suggest the approach of a frontal system, possibly leading to foggy conditions or a chance of rain in the near future.
