Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable decline in the percentage of patients presenting with Influenza-like Illness (ILI), with the ratio of ILI patients consistently decreasing and currently remaining below the baseline threshold. The highest rates of ILI were observed at the beginning of the time series, indicating a peak that has since subsided. All age groups followed a similar downward trend in ILI cases, with the most significant decreases in the younger populations (ages 0-4 and 5-24), which are traditionally more susceptible to influenza and ILI. The decrease in ILI rates is encouraging for the healthcare system, as it implies a reduction in the demand for medical resources specific to ILI treatment and suggests that the spread of influenza is currently controlled. However, continued monitoring is essential to rapidly identify and respond to any potential upticks in ILI rates, which could signal new outbreaks or the onset of influenza season.
