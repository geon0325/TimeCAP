Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual downward trend in temperature, reaching its lowest before a slight increase towards the current time. Humidity levels showed significant variation, with notably high percentages interspersed with drops that suggest the possibility of fog or mist formation, especially during periods of peak humidity. Air pressure saw fluctuations with a general decrease towards the end of the period, which could indicate an approaching weather system that may affect the local weather conditions. Wind speeds were mostly moderate but showed an increase recently, which, coupled with the current high humidity, could lead to cooler and potentially damp conditions. Wind direction varied significantly, with shifts from westerly to northerly and then to easterly winds, which could have contributed to the temperature and humidity changes observed in San Francisco.
