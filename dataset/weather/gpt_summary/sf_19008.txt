Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, indicating a slight warming trend. Humidity levels have remained consistently high and mostly unchanged, suggesting a continued presence of moisture in the air, which could lead to a perception of mugginess or the possibility of fog, particularly in coastal areas. Air pressure has been fairly stable with a slight increase observed in the most recent hours, possibly signaling a move towards more settled weather conditions. Wind speeds have been moderate without significant fluctuation, maintaining a steady flow, while the wind direction has seen a gradual shift towards the south-southeast. This consistent wind pattern, combined with high humidity, could influence the dispersal of any coastal fog that may develop.
