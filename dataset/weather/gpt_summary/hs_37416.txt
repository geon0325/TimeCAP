Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching a peak in the late afternoon before slightly decreasing towards the evening. Humidity levels initially fluctuated but displayed an overall upward trend towards the end of the period, indicating increased moisture in the air. Atmospheric pressure showed a consistent decline throughout the day, suggesting a potential change in weather patterns, such as the approach of a weather system that could bring precipitation or storms. Wind speeds remained relatively light to gentle and varied slightly, with a notable shift in wind direction from northerly to more easterly and then to southeasterly, consistent with the movement of air around a high-pressure system. These changing wind directions, coupled with decreasing pressure and increasing humidity, could signal the onset of more unsettled weather conditions in the near future.
