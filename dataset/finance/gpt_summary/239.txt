Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a general upward trend, closing higher by approximately 3% from 3168.57 to 3265.35, indicating a positive sentiment among investors. The VIX, commonly known as the "Fear Index," has remained low with minor fluctuations, suggesting a stable market with low volatility. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 indices have both experienced some volatility but have largely remained stable, closing slightly higher overall, which may reflect cautious optimism in Asian and European markets.

Gold Futures have increased by over 6%, moving from $1466.70 to $1557.50, signaling a possible shift by investors towards safe-haven assets amidst geopolitical uncertainties. The relatively stable exchange rates for EUR/USD and USD/JPY, along with a slight depreciation of the USD against the CNY, suggest that currency markets have not experienced significant stress, although ongoing trade discussions could influence future movements.
