Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a general increase in the number of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases across all age groups, with notable growth in the youngest age bracket (0-4 years). Despite seasonal fluctuations, there has been a persistent upward trend in ILI percentages, which, however, have remained below the baseline threshold for elevated influenza activity. The highest relative increase in ILI cases has been observed in the youngest and oldest age groups, signaling a potential need for increased vigilance and resources in pediatric and geriatric care. Even though the overall ratio of ILI patients has not breached the baseline, the consistent growth in ILI cases, especially among vulnerable age groups, could strain healthcare systems if the trend continues upward. Public health officials may consider this data to reinforce prevention efforts, including vaccination and public education, to manage the impact of ILI on community health.
