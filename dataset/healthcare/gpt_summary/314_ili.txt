Over the past 20 weeks, the ratio of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) patients to total patients presented a general increase, indicating a rising trend in ILI cases, although the ratio remains below the 2.9% baseline used to determine heightened influenza activity. The age group 0-4 consistently showed the highest number of ILI cases among the age groups, with a notable increase in the latter weeks, suggesting a higher vulnerability or increased transmission within this demographic. Conversely, the oldest age group, those 65 and above, consistently reported the fewest cases of ILI, which could reflect higher vaccination rates, better preventive measures, or possibly less exposure. The age groups 5-24 and 25-49 also witnessed fluctuations in ILI cases, with a mid-period peak followed by a decline towards the end of the observed period. These trends highlight the need for continued surveillance and possibly targeted public health interventions, especially for the youngest age group, to manage and mitigate the impact of ILI within the community.
