The time-series data over the last 20 weeks indicates a downward trend in the ratio of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) patients, with the latest figures falling below the baseline of 2.9%, suggesting a decrease in ILI prevalence. The highest ratios were observed in the middle of the observed period, with a subsequent decline to levels below 1%. Age-wise, the greatest number of ILI cases were seen in patients between the ages of 25-49, followed by the 5-24 age group, which could indicate higher transmission or susceptibility in these age brackets. The decline in ILI patient ratios may lead to reduced pressure on healthcare resources; however, vigilance is necessary as even low prevalence can impact vulnerable populations, particularly those aged 50 and above, and those younger than 5, who consistently presented with ILI cases throughout the period. These trends should inform public health strategies, including vaccination efforts and resource allocation to manage potential future increases in ILI cases.
