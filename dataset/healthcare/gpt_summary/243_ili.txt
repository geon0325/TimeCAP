Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant increase in the proportion of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases relative to the total number of patients, with the ratio of ILI patients exceeding the baseline indicator in recent weeks. This upward trend is particularly pronounced in the younger age groups, with the highest increases observed in children aged 0-4 and individuals aged 5-24, suggesting heightened transmission in these populations. The rise in ILI cases has also been notable among adults aged 25-49 and 50-64, as well as the elderly (aged 65 or more), though the increase in the oldest age group was less pronounced than in the younger cohorts. This escalating ILI activity has surpassed the established threshold for concern and could potentially strain healthcare resources if the trend continues. Public health officials may need to consider implementing measures to mitigate the spread of ILI, especially among the most affected age groups, and prepare for increased healthcare utilization.
