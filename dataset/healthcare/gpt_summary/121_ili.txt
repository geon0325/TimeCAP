The analysis of the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data over the past 20 weeks reveals that the percentage of patients exhibiting ILI symptoms has consistently remained below the baseline of 2.9%, indicating a relatively stable and mild ILI activity within the population. The age group of 0-4 consistently shows the highest number of ILI cases, which is a common trend due to the higher susceptibility of young children to respiratory infections. However, there has been a gradual increase in the ratio of ILI patients across all age groups towards the end of the 20-week period, suggesting a slight upward trend in ILI activity. This uptick may indicate the beginning of an upward trend in ILI cases, which could put additional strain on healthcare resources if the trend continues. Healthcare providers should monitor these trends closely to allocate resources effectively and prepare for potential increases in ILI cases.
