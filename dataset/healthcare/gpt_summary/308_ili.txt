Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a fluctuating trend in the overall number of patients, with a noticeable increase in recent weeks. The ratio of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) patients remained consistently below the baseline of 2.9% throughout the period, suggesting that the prevalence of ILI was relatively low compared to the baseline threshold. Notably, there was a progressive increase in ILI cases among the age group 0-4, potentially indicating a higher vulnerability or increased exposure within this demographic. The age groups 25-49 and 50-64 also showed an uptick in ILI cases towards the end of the period, but the oldest age group, 65 and above, remained relatively stable with minimal fluctuations. These trends are critical for healthcare resource planning, signaling a need for heightened vigilance in pediatric care and potential adjustments in health advisories for the younger and middle-aged populations.
