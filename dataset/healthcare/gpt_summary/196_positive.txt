Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable upward trend in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the overall positivity ratio rising from 2.02% to 9.55%, significantly higher than the 20-week average of 6.26%. Particularly, there has been a sharp increase in Influenza B detections, with the positivity ratio escalating from 0.89% to 7.07%, suggesting a potential shift in the dominant influenza strain. The total number of specimens tested has also increased steadily, peaking at 36,497 in the most recent week, which could reflect a higher incidence of respiratory illness or an expansion in testing capacity. The jump in positive Influenza B cases, from 81 to 2581, is especially concerning and could indicate a more aggressive spread, requiring increased vigilance and potentially straining healthcare resources. These trends highlight the importance of continued monitoring, vaccination efforts, and preparedness in healthcare settings to manage the rising impact of influenza.
