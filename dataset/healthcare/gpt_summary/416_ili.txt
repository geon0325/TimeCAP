The time-series data indicates that the proportion of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases among the total patient count has been consistently above the 2.9% benchmark for the first three weeks, signifying a period of high ILI activity. Subsequently, the ILI percentage has been on a declining trend, falling below the threshold in week 4 and continuing to decrease, reaching a low of 1.95% by week 17. The age group data reveals that the highest burden of ILI consistently falls within the 25-49 age group, followed by the 0-4, 5-24, 50-64, and 65 or more age groups, in that order. There was a noticeable decline in ILI cases across all age groups after week 3, which could indicate a waning influenza season or effective public health interventions. This downward trend in ILI cases suggests a lessening strain on healthcare resources; however, ongoing surveillance is necessary to monitor for potential resurgences or new outbreaks.
