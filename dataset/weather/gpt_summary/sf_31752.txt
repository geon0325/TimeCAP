Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a notable upward trend in temperature, transitioning from cooler conditions in the early hours to significantly warmer temperatures by the end of the sequence. Humidity levels fluctuated, starting higher, dipping midday—likely correlating with the increase in temperatures and air pressure changes—before rising again towards the evening. Air pressure exhibited a sharp increase in the middle of the day, which might have contributed to the stabilization of weather conditions, but later showed a decreasing trend, potentially signaling a change in weather patterns. Wind speed varied, with a pronounced increase during two separate periods, which could have influenced the dispersal of humidity and the perceived temperature. The direction of the wind was predominantly from the west, with some variable shifts, indicating the movement of weather systems across the region.
