Over the last 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature followed by a slight decrease, suggesting a typically warm day with a cooler evening. Humidity levels showed significant variations, with particularly high levels during the cooler early hours, which could have led to instances of morning mist or fog, and then a decrease during the warmest part of the day, providing some relief from the heat. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a notable increase during the day, indicating a period of steady weather but also the potential for a change in weather patterns. Wind speeds varied from calm to moderate throughout the period, with a peak in the afternoon which may have contributed to a more comfortable feel by aiding in the dispersal of urban heat and pollution. Wind direction was variable, with shifts from northerly to southerly and then predominantly westerly, which could have influenced temperature fluctuations and distribution of air masses across the city.
