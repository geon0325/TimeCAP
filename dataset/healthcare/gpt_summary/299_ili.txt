The analysis of the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data over the last 20 weeks reveals that the overall ratio of ILI patients has remained well below the baseline of 2.9%, indicating a relatively mild influenza season thus far. There has been a noticeable peak in the ratio of ILI patients in the age group of 25-49, which consistently reported the highest numbers across all age categories, suggesting that this demographic may be the most affected and could potentially be a target for increased influenza vaccination efforts. Despite a slight increase in the middle of the observed period, the ratio of ILI patients has shown a declining trend towards the end of the 20 weeks, particularly in the last week where it dropped below the initial ratio. The age group of 65 or more has consistently reported the lowest numbers of ILI patients, which could indicate higher rates of vaccination or potentially less exposure to the virus among this age group. As the ratio of ILI patients remains below the threshold for heightened concern, the healthcare system is likely not currently strained by influenza cases, but continued surveillance is important to monitor for any changes in trends, especially in the most affected age groups.
