Over the last 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature with a general trend of cooling during the early hours, followed by a significant warming period through the afternoon, and a stabilization towards the evening. Humidity levels saw a peak coinciding with the cooler temperatures in the early hours, but a gradual decrease was observed as temperatures rose, suggesting a typical diurnal pattern. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, indicating a steady atmospheric condition without the presence of strong weather systems. Wind speed varied, with calmer conditions prevalent during the night and early morning, and a noticeable increase towards the end of the 24-hour period that could signal a change in weather patterns. Wind direction was predominantly from the south, shifting to a westerly direction for a brief period, before returning to southerly winds, which could have contributed to the warming temperatures due to the advection of warmer air from the south.
