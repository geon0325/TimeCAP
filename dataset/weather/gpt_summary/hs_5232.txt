Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, indicating a warming trend that peaked during the late afternoon before slightly cooling down. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with higher humidity in the early morning hours, which decreased as temperatures rose, and then increased again toward the end of the period, suggesting the possibility of a more muggy evening. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase midday, followed by a gradual decrease, which could signal a minor change in the weather pattern, such as the approach of a weak front. Wind speeds varied minimally, generally staying light, but there was a notable increase in wind speed at the end of the period, which could contribute to a change in the upcoming weather conditions. The wind direction was variable, with a shift from predominantly westerly to southerly winds, which may bring in moisture from the Gulf, potentially affecting local weather conditions with increased humidity and chances of precipitation.
