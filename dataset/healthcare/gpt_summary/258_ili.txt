Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a decreasing trend in the incidence of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) across all age groups. The ratio of ILI patients has consistently diminished and has now fallen below the baseline threshold, suggesting a reduction in the spread of influenza-like symptoms. The age group 0-4 years initially had a higher number of ILI cases but showed a significant decline, reflecting a possible reduction in viral transmission among young children. The age groups 5-24 and 25-49 years, which typically represent school-aged children and the active workforce, respectively, also exhibited a substantial decrease in ILI cases, potentially indicating a positive impact on educational institutions and workplaces. This downward trend in ILI activity may lessen the burden on healthcare resources and could indicate a close to the influenza season, but continuous monitoring is advised to prepare for any unexpected changes in the pattern.
