Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant fluctuation in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the peak ratio of positive specimens reaching 6.23% in week 13, surpassing the 20-week average of 6.26%. The data indicates a substantial increase in the number of specimens testing positive for Influenza A, which peaked at 6.17% in week 13 before gradually declining, while Influenza B remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations around its 20-week average. Notably, Influenza A has been the predominant strain, accounting for the majority of positive cases, particularly during the mid-season surge. The recent weeks show a downward trend in the percentage of positive specimens for both Influenza A and B, suggesting a possible tapering off of the seasonal outbreak. The healthcare system should remain vigilant for potential increases in influenza activity and ensure adequate resources for testing and treatment, especially in the face of potential co-circulation with other respiratory viruses.
