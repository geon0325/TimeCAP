Atmospheric pressure has remained relatively steady, suggesting stable weather conditions without the immediate influence of strong weather systems. Wind speeds were generally light with a brief period of increased winds, and the wind direction shifted throughout the day, which is common in coastal areas due to the complex interaction between land and sea breezes.
