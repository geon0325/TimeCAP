Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable upward trend in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the total ratio of positive specimens nearly tripling from 1.00% to 3.16%. This increase is primarily driven by a significant rise in Influenza A cases, where the positive specimen ratio has more than quadrupled from 0.64% to 2.72%. Influenza B has also shown a slight increase but has been more stable, with the percentage of positive specimens fluctuating between 0.19% and 0.53%. The number of specimens tested peaked in week 20 at 24,519, which coincides with the highest percentage of positive specimens, suggesting a possible intensification of the testing response to an escalating flu season. The growing prevalence of influenza, particularly A strain, could signal a potential strain on healthcare resources due to increased patient volume and the need for targeted public health interventions.
