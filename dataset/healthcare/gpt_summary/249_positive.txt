Over the last 20 weeks, the data reveals an overall low but fluctuating presence of influenza with an average positivity rate of 6.26%, peaking at 0.40% in week 10. There has been an increase in the number of specimens tested, rising from 6,176 in week 1 to a peak of 38,746 in week 19, suggesting heightened surveillance or possibly an increased incidence of respiratory illnesses. Influenza B has consistently shown a higher positivity rate than Influenza A, with its highest rate at 0.22% in week 10 compared to Influenza A's peak of 0.20% in week 13. The most recent data indicates a decrease in positivity rates for both Influenza A and B to 0.05% and 0.10%, respectively, suggesting a possible decline in influenza activity. Healthcare systems should remain vigilant, as even low levels of influenza can have significant impacts on vulnerable populations and could signal the onset of a larger outbreak.
