The analysis of the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data over the last 20 weeks indicates a downward trend in the percentage of patients with ILI symptoms across all age groups. Initially, the rate of ILI patients was substantially above the baseline threshold, suggesting a heightened level of influenza activity. However, as the weeks progressed, there was a noticeable decline in ILI percentages, with recent weeks showing values consistently below the baseline. This reduction could imply a decrease in influenza transmission or the effectiveness of preventive measures, potentially easing the burden on healthcare resources. Nevertheless, continued monitoring is essential to ensure that this trend is sustained and to prepare for any possible resurgence of ILI cases.
