Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has exhibited a noticeable fluctuation, starting off warm before decreasing significantly, then later rising again to reach a peak, and finally moderately decreasing towards the end of the period. Humidity levels started at moderate levels, increased to high levels during the cooler early hours, and then dropped significantly as temperatures rose, suggesting a typical diurnal pattern. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with a slight increase followed by a minor decrease, indicating stable weather conditions without significant weather fronts moving through the area. Wind speeds were generally light and showed little variation, which is typical for the region and does not suggest any immediate weather disturbances. Wind direction shifted gradually from northerly to easterly, a change that is often associated with the passage of weather systems, but given the light wind speeds and stable pressure, no significant weather events seem to be imminent.
