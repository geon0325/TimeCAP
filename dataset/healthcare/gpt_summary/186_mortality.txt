Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to total deaths, with a high of 10.72% and a low of 5.20%, which is inconsistent with the average ratio of 7.84%. The total number of deaths has decreased from 64,121 to 57,623, while deaths from influenza have shown an upward trend, increasing from 13 to 111. Pneumonia-related deaths started at 6,840 and experienced an initial decrease, reaching a low of 2,714, before climbing back up to 3,480. The ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia has recently risen, from a 20-week low of 5.20% to 6.23%, still below the average ratio. This data suggests a potential seasonal impact on influenza-related mortality and a possible resurgence, which could put pressure on healthcare resources if the trend continues.
