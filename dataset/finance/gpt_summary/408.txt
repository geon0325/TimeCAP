Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown an overall upward trend, increasing from 3372.85 to 3340.97, despite some fluctuations and a notable drop around the 15th market day. The VIX, which measures market volatility, spiked in correlation with the S&P 500's drop, indicating increased market uncertainty during that period. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 have experienced some volatility, with the Nikkei showing a slight increase and the FTSE struggling with a moderate downward trend. Gold futures have remained relatively stable with some minor fluctuations, suggesting it continues to act as a safe-haven asset amidst market volatility. Both crude oil futures and the major currency pairs (EUR/USD, USD/JPY, and USD/CNY) have shown some instability, with crude oil notably decreasing, which may reflect concerns over global economic recovery.
