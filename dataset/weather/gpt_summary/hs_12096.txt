Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a modest increase in temperature followed by a gradual decline, indicating a typical diurnal pattern with warmer conditions during the afternoon transitioning to cooler temperatures at night. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with very high readings suggestive of possible fog or mist formation, especially during the early morning hours when they reached saturation. Atmospheric pressure showed a slight but steady decrease throughout the period, which could signal a gradual change in weather patterns, possibly leading to increased cloudiness or a chance of precipitation. Wind speeds varied, with some hours experiencing gentle to moderate breezes; however, there was an increase in wind activity in the later hours, which may contribute to cooler perceived temperatures and assist in dispersing any lingering humidity or fog. The wind direction was predominantly southerly to southeasterly, which is characteristic for Houston and often associated with the transport of moist air from the Gulf of Mexico into the region.
