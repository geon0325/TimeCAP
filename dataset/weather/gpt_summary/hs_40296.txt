Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before showing a slight decline towards the evening. Humidity levels have varied considerably, with a noticeable drop during the peak temperature hours, indicating a typical diurnal pattern where humidity decreases as temperature rises. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with only minor fluctuations, suggesting a stable weather pattern without any immediate indication of significant weather fronts or storm systems approaching. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with some increase observed during the latter part of the day, which could contribute to a slight cooling effect despite the warmer temperatures. The wind direction was predominantly from the southeast, which is common for Houston, often bringing in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and potentially leading to higher humidity levels at times.
