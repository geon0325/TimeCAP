Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a moderate fluctuation in temperature, indicating a transition between cooler and warmer conditions throughout the day. Humidity levels started average but increased significantly during the night, possibly contributing to a sense of increased chill before lowering again towards the afternoon. Air pressure remained relatively stable, which is indicative of steady weather conditions without significant changes in weather patterns. Wind speeds were generally light, with some increase towards the latter part of the period, suggesting that any airborne particulates would not disperse quickly, potentially impacting air quality.
