Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant upward trend in both the number of respiratory specimens tested for influenza and the number of positive cases for Influenza A and B. The percentage of positive specimens has more than quadrupled from 1.90% to 27.37%, indicating a substantial increase in influenza prevalence. Influenza A has been more prevalent than Influenza B, but both subtypes have shown a sharp increase in positive cases, with Influenza A peaking at 22.19% positivity and Influenza B at 6.66% in the most recent week. The healthcare system may experience increased strain due to this rise in influenza cases, potentially leading to higher hospitalization rates and a need for more resources, including medical staff and treatments. Public health initiatives may need to focus on influenza prevention, such as vaccination and awareness campaigns, to mitigate the spread and impact of the virus.
