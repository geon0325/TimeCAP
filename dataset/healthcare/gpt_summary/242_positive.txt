Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a gradual increase in the number of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the percentage of positive specimens rising from 0.17% to 0.39%, peaking above the average of 6.26%. The number of specimens tested has also increased significantly, reaching a peak of 14,924 in the final week, indicating a possible surge in respiratory illness and a higher demand for testing. Influenza A positivity rates showed a slight increase from 0.12% to 0.20%, while Influenza B exhibited a more pronounced variability, with the rate initially at 0.05%, spiking to 0.19%, and ending at 0.19% in the last week. The highest single-week increase for both Influenza A and B occurred in the last week of the dataset. This upward trend in both testing and positivity rates could suggest an ongoing or impending influenza outbreak, necessitating increased healthcare resources and public health interventions.
