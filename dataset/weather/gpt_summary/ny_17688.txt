Over the past 24 hours in New York City, the weather has been characterized by relatively stable temperatures with a slight cooling trend overnight followed by a gradual warming throughout the day. Humidity levels experienced a moderate increase overnight which then decreased significantly during the daytime, suggesting drier air moving into the area. Air pressure has been slowly increasing, indicating a potential period of stable weather conditions. Wind speeds were mostly gentle to moderate but increased to strong levels towards the end of the review period, with wind direction predominantly from the west and shifting slightly to include southern components. The combination of rising air pressure, decreasing humidity, and increasing wind speeds may suggest the approach of a frontal system, potentially leading to clearer and drier conditions in the short term.
