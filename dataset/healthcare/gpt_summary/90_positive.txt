Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a significant upward trend in the number of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the total positivity rate increasing from 2.53% to 4.24%. The number of specimens tested has also risen steadily, peaking at 21,886 in the final week. Influenza A has shown a more pronounced increase in positivity than Influenza B, with its rate more than doubling from 1.25% to 3.15% as opposed to the increase from 1.28% to 1.10% for Influenza B. This trend suggests a higher prevalence and potential dominance of Influenza A in the current healthcare landscape. Given these trends, healthcare systems may face increased demand for medical care and influenza-related resources, highlighting the need for continued monitoring and potentially increased influenza vaccination efforts.
