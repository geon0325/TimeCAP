Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature that reached its peak in the late afternoon before slightly cooling down towards the evening. Humidity levels were high during the early hours, indicating the presence of considerable moisture in the air, which decreased as temperatures rose and then slightly increased again by the end of the period. The air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, suggesting a period of settled weather without significant fronts or storm systems impacting the area. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with a slight increase in the late afternoon, while wind directions were variable but predominantly from the south to southeast, which is typical for the region and can contribute to the warmer temperatures. The combination of high humidity and rising temperatures throughout the day could have led to uncomfortable conditions, especially during the peak heat hours.
