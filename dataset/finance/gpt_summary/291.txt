Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has experienced significant volatility, with a notable drop to 2237.40 before a partial recovery to 2630.07, reflecting investor uncertainty and market instability. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, spiked to an extreme high of 82.69, aligning with the large fluctuations in the S&P 500, and remains elevated above historical averages, signaling ongoing market stress. International markets mirrored this turbulence, with Japan's Nikkei 225 and the UK's FTSE 100 both experiencing sharp declines and partial rebounds, indicating a global impact. Gold futures initially rose to 1666.40 as investors sought safe havens, but subsequently retreated, suggesting a complex interplay between risk aversion and liquidation needs. Crude Oil futures plunged to unprecedented lows, reaching 20.37 at one point, driven by a price war and demand concerns amidst the global situation, while currency exchange rates saw the USD strengthen against the EUR and JPY, but fluctuate against the CNY, reflecting shifting investor sentiment and cross-border monetary flows.
