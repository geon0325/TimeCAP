Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with a slight downward trend, closing lower at 4450.32 compared to 4369.71. The VIX, which measures market volatility, has mostly declined, indicating increased investor confidence, yet a slight uptick at the end of the period to 13.79 suggests some emerging cautiousness. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 have both trended upwards, with the Nikkei 225 rising from 31450.76 to 33533.09 and the FTSE 100 reaching a high of 7711.40, reflecting positive sentiment in the Asian and European markets. Gold Futures have remained relatively stable with a minor increase, suggesting continued investor interest in safe-haven assets amid market fluctuations. The foreign exchange market has seen the USD strengthening against the EUR and CNY but has remained more stable against the JPY, which could affect international trade dynamics and potentially impact multinational companies.
