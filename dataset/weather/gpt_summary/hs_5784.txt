Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, peaking in the late afternoon before slightly declining towards the evening. Despite these temperature fluctuations, humidity levels remained relatively high through the night and early morning, with a noticeable drop during the afternoon hours, indicating potential discomfort for residents due to mugginess. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with minor fluctuations that are not indicative of any significant weather disturbances. Wind speeds varied, with a period of calmer winds in the early morning hours transitioning to stronger gusts towards the afternoon and evening, which could have contributed to the dispersal of humidity. The wind direction was predominantly from the south to southeast, which is typical for Houston and can often bring warmer air and moisture from the Gulf of Mexico into the region.
