Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable decrease in the percentage of deaths attributable to influenza or pneumonia, with the ratio of mortality from these causes to total deaths declining from 19.40% to 7.03%. This trend suggests a significant reduction in influenza or pneumonia-related mortality, which could indicate an effective response to seasonal outbreaks, possibly through vaccination efforts or public health interventions. The total number of deaths from all causes has also shown a decreasing pattern, from 87,232 in the initial week to 57,217 in the final week of the data set. However, the absolute number of deaths from pneumonia still represents a substantial burden, with a slight increase in the mid-period followed by a continued decline in the later weeks. These findings could affect healthcare resource allocation and highlight the need for ongoing surveillance and prevention strategies for respiratory infections.
