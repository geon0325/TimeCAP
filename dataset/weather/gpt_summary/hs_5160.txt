Over the last 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable drop in temperature during the night, followed by a significant increase during the day, indicating a typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels started relatively low but saw a sharp rise overnight, which then decreased steadily throughout the day, possibly due to increasing temperatures. Air pressure experienced a gradual decline, which could suggest the approach of a weather system that may affect local conditions. Wind speeds were variable but generally light to moderate, with some calm periods, and the wind direction shifted throughout the day, suggesting a lack of a dominant weather front. Overall, the fluctuating humidity and declining air pressure, combined with variable winds, could lead to changing weather patterns in the near future for Houston.
