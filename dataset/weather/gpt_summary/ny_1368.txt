Over the past 24 hours in New York City, temperatures have observed minor fluctuations, generally maintaining a cold environment consistent with a typical day in the city during this season. Humidity levels showed considerable variance, starting at moderate levels before increasing significantly towards the latter half of the period, which could have led to a feeling of increased chilliness or potential fog development. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with only slight variations, indicating a period of steady weather without the immediate likelihood of significant weather systems moving into the area. Wind speeds were mostly calm to light, with a slight increase later on, suggesting a gentle breeze that may have affected the perceived temperature, especially when combined with increased humidity. Wind direction was variable but predominantly came from a northerly to easterly direction, which is typical for the region and may have contributed to the consistent cold temperatures observed.
