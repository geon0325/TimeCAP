Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a marked decline in the overall percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the ratio of positive specimens decreasing from a high of 26.24% to a low of 1.90%. This decline is observed for both Influenza A and B, with Influenza A showing a more pronounced drop from 25.36% to 1.04% of the specimens tested, indicating a significant reduction in its prevalence. In contrast, Influenza B maintained a relatively stable but small percentage of positives, ranging from 0.79% to 1.85%, before falling to 0.86%. The overall downward trend suggests that the influenza season is waning, which could potentially lead to a decrease in healthcare system burden related to flu cases. However, it's important to remain vigilant for any signs of new outbreaks or variations in the trend, as influenza patterns can be unpredictable and may require rapid healthcare response.
