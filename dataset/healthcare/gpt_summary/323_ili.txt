Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a steady increase in the total number of patients presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI), with a noticeable uptick in the most recent weeks. The age groups 0-4 and 25-49 years have experienced a more pronounced rise in ILI cases, suggesting that these populations might be more susceptible to the current strain or strains of influenza or other ILI-causing pathogens. Despite the growth in ILI cases across all age groups, the ratio of ILI patients to total patients has remained below the baseline of 2.9%, indicating that while ILI is on the rise, it has not yet reached levels typically associated with an influenza outbreak. However, the consistent upward trend in the ratio of ILI patients warrants close monitoring, as it may signal an approaching peak in ILI activity that could strain healthcare resources. The healthcare system should be prepared for a potential increase in demand for medical care, especially for the youngest and working-age populations, who are currently showing the highest increases in ILI incidence.
