Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have exhibited a warming trend, particularly noticeable during the daytime hours, which is typical following the cooler temperatures experienced in the early morning. Humidity levels have shown a significant decrease throughout the day, indicating drier air moving into the region. Air pressure has seen a slight decrease after remaining relatively stable, suggesting a possible change in the weather pattern. Wind speeds have fluctuated mildly with a slight increase observed in the later hours, while wind direction has predominantly shifted from easterly to southeasterly. This combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and changing air pressure could suggest the onset of a warmer, drier period, with the potential for increased variability in wind patterns.
