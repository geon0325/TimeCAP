Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual decrease in temperature from the day through the night, followed by a modest increase as the day progressed, indicative of the typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuation, with notably higher percentages during the cooler early morning hours, which then dropped to much lower values in the afternoon, suggesting the possibility of drier conditions during the day. Air pressure varied within a narrow range, maintaining a generally stable atmosphere, except for a period of slightly higher pressure, which could be associated with clearer skies. Wind speeds were mostly light, with an increase in the evening, which could have contributed to the drop in humidity by dispersing moisture in the air. The wind direction varied widely throughout the day, suggesting shifting weather patterns that could influence local climate conditions such as fog development along the coast.
