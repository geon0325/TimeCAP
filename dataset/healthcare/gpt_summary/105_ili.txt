Over the last 20 weeks, the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data indicates a gradual decline in the percentage of ILI patients across all age groups, with the highest ratios observed in the earlier weeks. The most significant burden of ILI was initially on the younger and middle-age populations, particularly those aged 5-24 and 25-49, where the numbers have since decreased but were notably higher than other age groups. While the overall number of patients has decreased, the ratio of ILI patients remains above the baseline of 2.9% for multiple weeks, suggesting a period of heightened ILI activity. The trend shows that, although ILI ratios have fallen below the baseline in recent weeks, indicating a potential easing of the ILI incidence, the healthcare system might have experienced increased pressure during the peak periods. Continued monitoring is necessary to detect any potential resurgence and ensure that healthcare facilities can manage patient loads effectively.
