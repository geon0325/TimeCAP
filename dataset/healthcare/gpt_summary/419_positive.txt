Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant increase in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the overall ratio of positive specimens rising from 1.51% to 14.96%, peaking at 18.27% in week 11. Influenza A has consistently been more prevalent than Influenza B, although both subtypes have shown substantial growth in the number of positive specimens, with Influenza A peaking at 14.99% and Influenza B at 6.93% of tested specimens. The highest weekly increase in positive specimens for both Influenza A and B occurred between weeks 7 and 8, suggesting a sharp rise in transmission or an outbreak peak during that period. Notably, the ratio of positive specimens for both Influenza A and B has been decreasing in the last three weeks, indicating a possible decline in influenza activity. This trend is critical for healthcare systems to anticipate potential changes in demand for medical care and to adjust resource allocation and public health interventions accordingly.
