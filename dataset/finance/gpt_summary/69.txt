Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a general upward trend, peaking mid-period before experiencing a downturn in the most recent sessions, ending slightly below its starting point. The VIX indicates increased volatility in the latter part of the period, with a notable spike aligning with the S&P 500's decline, suggesting growing investor anxiety. The Nikkei 225 demonstrated relative stability with a slight upward bias during the middle of the period, but like the S&P 500, it retreated in the final sessions, reflecting a potential shift in market sentiment across global equities. Commodity prices such as Gold and Crude Oil Futures have fluctuated, but both ended the period near their starting values, indicating a lack of strong directional momentum. Exchange rates have seen minor fluctuations, with the Euro and the Japanese Yen depreciating against the Dollar, while the Chinese Yuan ended slightly higher, which could have implications for trade and international investments.
