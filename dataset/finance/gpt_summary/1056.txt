Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 exhibited a general uptrend, closing higher by 4.84% from 3919.29 to 4108.94, which may indicate growing investor confidence or a positive reaction to economic or corporate news. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, trended downwards from 23.73 to 19.10, suggesting a decrease in investor anxiety and potential stabilization in the market. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 also reflected an upward momentum, with the Nikkei 225 gaining 2.58% and the FTSE 100 rising by 1.95%, indicating a positive sentiment across global markets. Gold Futures saw a rise initially, followed by some volatility, but ended slightly lower at 2004.80, possibly as investors balanced risk with the appeal of traditional safe-haven assets. Crude Oil Futures rose by 14.2% from 71.33 to 81.53, a movement that may affect inflationary pressures and economic outlooks, while currency exchange rates showed relative stability with minor fluctuations in EUR/USD and a slight weakening of the USD against JPY and CNY, suggesting nuanced shifts in currency market dynamics.
