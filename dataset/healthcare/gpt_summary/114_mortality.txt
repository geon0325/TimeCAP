Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia has shown a general decreasing trend as a proportion of total deaths, starting at 7.75% and ending at 5.36%, falling below the 20-week average of 7.84%. The total number of deaths has remained relatively stable, fluctuating between 51636 and 57893. Deaths specifically attributed to influenza have seen a significant decrease from 511 to 8, suggesting a possible reduction in influenza prevalence or effective control measures. Pneumonia-related mortality has also decreased, though more modestly, from 3978 to 2762, indicating it remains a significant concern for healthcare systems. The drop in the mortality ratio suggests that while Influenza or Pneumonia still contribute to overall mortality, their impact is lessening, which could alleviate some pressure on healthcare resources dedicated to these conditions.
