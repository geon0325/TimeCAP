Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a notable fluctuation in temperature, exhibiting a cooling trend during the nighttime hours and warming up significantly into the daytime. Humidity levels have shown significant variability, with notably high levels during the early morning hours suggesting the potential for fog formation, which is common for coastal cities like San Francisco, followed by a sharp decrease throughout the day, indicating drier conditions that could affect comfort levels and fire risk. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight downward trend towards the end of the period, which might indicate an approaching weather system that could alter current conditions. Wind speeds stayed mostly light and variable, which is typical for San Francisco's microclimates, potentially contributing to varied weather experiences across different parts of the city. The wind direction was predominantly from the northwest but showed hourly shifts, which could influence coastal fog dispersal and the distribution of temperatures within the city.
