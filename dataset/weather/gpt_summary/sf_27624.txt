Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have experienced a slight fluctuation but largely remained within a narrow range, indicating a period of stable weather conditions. Humidity levels have seen a significant rise during the night, which could have led to morning fog or dew, a common occurrence in the area, before settling back to moderate levels by the afternoon. Air pressure has shown a gradual decrease over the period, which might suggest an approaching weather system that could lead to changes in weather patterns, such as increased cloudiness or a chance of precipitation. Wind speeds have been mostly gentle to moderate with some hours experiencing slightly stronger breezes, and wind direction has varied but predominantly came from the north and east, which is typical for San Francisco's weather. The combination of these indicators points to a stable weather situation with no extreme weather events observed, but the drop in air pressure warrants attention for any potential incoming changes.
