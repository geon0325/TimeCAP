Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have shown a gradual increase, indicative of a warming trend that led to a noticeably warmer atmosphere by the late afternoon and evening. The humidity levels were extremely high during the early hours but started to decrease as the temperature rose, suggesting the dissipation of morning moisture. Air pressure experienced a slight but steady decline throughout the day, which could be associated with a change in weather patterns, potentially leading to less stable conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate but increased towards the evening, which, combined with the shift to a southerly direction, could signal the approach of a weather front. The wind direction varied but predominantly came from the east to southeast, which is typical for this region and could contribute to the influx of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico.
