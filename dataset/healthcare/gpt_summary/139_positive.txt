Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable upward trend in the number of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the percentage of positive specimens increasing from 1.58% to 1.99%. The total number of specimens tested escalated steeply towards the latter weeks, reaching a peak of 20,221 in the final week from an initial count of 9,703. Influenza A has consistently been more prevalent than Influenza B, with its positive specimen ratio increasing from 0.75% to 1.54%, which could indicate a dominant strain in the current flu season. Despite this, Influenza B also exhibited a rise in positive cases, albeit less pronounced, suggesting co-circulation of both strains. This upward trajectory in flu cases could strain healthcare resources and warrants increased vigilance and possibly enhanced flu vaccination efforts.
