Humidity levels have fluctuated significantly, with peaks suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air which could contribute to a feeling of dampness or the possibility of fog, especially during periods of higher humidity. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor variations, indicating a lack of significant weather fronts moving through the area that could lead to drastic weather changes. Wind speeds varied from calm to moderate breezes, with an occasional gust, which, combined with the shifts in wind direction, suggests a variable and possibly unsettled local wind pattern.
