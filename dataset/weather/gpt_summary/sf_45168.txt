Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, weather conditions have remained remarkably consistent, with no fluctuations in temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed, or wind direction. The stable temperature suggests a strong and persistent weather pattern, possibly under the influence of a high-pressure system. Low humidity levels indicate dry atmospheric conditions, which could increase the risk of wildfires in surrounding areas if they persist. Wind conditions have been steady, both in terms of speed and direction, which is likely contributing to the sustained weather pattern observed. Given the constant air pressure, there is currently no indication of imminent changes in weather conditions, suggesting that the current pattern may persist in the short term.
