Humidity experienced fluctuations, with very high levels during the early hours, which then dropped significantly but increased again towards the end of the period, indicating variable moisture in the air which could contribute to changing weather conditions. Air pressure showed an overall increase, suggesting the possible onset of more stable weather conditions or the movement of a high-pressure system into the region. Wind speeds were mostly moderate but showed an increase towards the middle of the time series, indicating the possibility of a passing weather system.
