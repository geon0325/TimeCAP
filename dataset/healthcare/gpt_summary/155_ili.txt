The analysis of the 20-week Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data demonstrates a clear seasonal trend with a peak in ILI patient percentages that significantly exceeded the baseline ratio, indicating an intense period of ILI activity within the observed timeframe. Particularly noteworthy is the highest ILI patient ratio recorded early in the timeframe, which has since shown a consistent decline week-over-week to levels now below the baseline. Age-wise, the highest burden of ILI was seen in the youngest (0-4 years) and school-aged children (5-24 years), which is typical given their higher rates of transmission and susceptibility. The current downward trend across all age groups suggests a waning ILI season, which may lead to a reduction in healthcare system strain from ILI cases. However, vigilance is necessary as any change in the trend could indicate the emergence of new ILI strains or an increase in activity, necessitating readiness for a potential increase in healthcare resource allocation.
