Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have exhibited a typical diurnal pattern, with a peak during the late afternoon hours and a gradual decrease overnight, before rising again towards the end of the reporting period. Relative humidity levels inversely correlated with temperature changes, increasing during the cooler nighttime and decreasing as temperatures rose, reaching their lowest point in the late afternoon, indicative of typical moisture variations throughout the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increasing trend over the course of the day, which could suggest stable weather conditions persisting in the short term. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate and showed no significant fluctuations, maintaining gentle breezes that are common for the area. The wind direction was predominantly from the south to southwest, which is typical for Houston and could contribute to the transport of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, potentially affecting local humidity levels.
