Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, followed by a slight increase as the day progressed, indicative of typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels have shown significant fluctuations, with a peak that suggests the possibility of fog or mist formation, especially when the humidity reached saturation. Air pressure in the region has been variable but mostly increasing, which could be associated with the settling of more stable weather conditions. Wind speeds have been moderate with occasional gusts, while the predominant wind direction has shifted from southerly to westerly, which may influence coastal weather patterns and could potentially bring cooler and moister air from the ocean. Overall, the combination of these weather indicators suggests a typical pattern for San Francisco with no extreme weather conditions expected in the near term.
