Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a slight upward trend, increasing from 4202.04 to 4290.61, hinting at investor confidence in the US equity market. Conversely, the VIX, which measures market volatility, has generally declined from 17.90 to 15.76, reflecting reduced market anxiety and a more stable investment environment. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have experienced volatility with the Nikkei rebounding after a dip and the FTSE 100 showing modest fluctuations with a slight decrease at the end of the period. Gold Futures have seen a decline from 1902.90 to 1779.60, suggesting a shift away from safe-haven assets, while Crude Oil Futures have been more volatile but ended slightly higher, moving from 67.72 to 72.91, which could indicate concerns about supply constraints or rising energy demand. Exchange rates reveal a slight weakening of the US dollar against the Euro and the Japanese Yen, with EUR/USD moving from 1.22 to 1.19 and USD/JPY from 109.49 to 110.82, while the USD/CNY pair remained relatively stable, ending slightly higher, possibly reflecting the current stability in trade relations between the US and China.
