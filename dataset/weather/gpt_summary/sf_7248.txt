Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures experienced a steady decrease from the initial hours, reaching a minimum before gradually rising again, indicative of the typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels remained relatively high throughout the period, suggesting a significant amount of moisture in the air, which could have implications for fog formation, especially during the cooler night and early morning hours. Air pressure saw an overall increase, which generally signals more stable atmospheric conditions and could lead to clearer skies. Wind speeds were mostly light to gentle, with a slight uptick observed in the latest hours, and the wind direction was predominantly from the southwest, shifting slightly more westerly over time. These conditions, combined with the high humidity, could lead to cooler and potentially foggy conditions, especially along the coast and in low-lying areas.
