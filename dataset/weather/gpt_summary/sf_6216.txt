Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a mild and decreasing trend in temperature, starting from a relatively warm condition and cooling off towards the early hours. Humidity levels remained high throughout the period, suggesting a moist and potentially foggy atmosphere which is common for the region. Air pressure was mostly stable with a significant drop at one point, which could indicate a quick passing weather system that might have brought a change in conditions, such as a brief rainfall or gust of wind. Wind speeds were generally low but picked up notably for a short duration, potentially correlating with the pressure drop. The wind direction varied, showing a mix of westerly and northerly flows, with a shift to easterly directions towards the end of the period, which could influence the movement of any coastal fog or marine layer.
