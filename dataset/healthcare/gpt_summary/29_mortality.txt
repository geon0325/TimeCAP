Over the past 20 weeks, the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia relative to total deaths has exhibited a fluctuating yet upward trend, starting at 5.79% and ending at 6.62%, which is below the average ratio of 7.84%. Despite the total number of deaths increasing from 49,362 to 55,169, the number of deaths attributed specifically to Influenza has seen a modest rise from 3 to 33 deaths per week. However, deaths from Pneumonia have shown a more significant increase, starting at 2,853 and rising to 3,618. The highest observed weekly mortality ratio for Influenza or Pneumonia was in the last recorded week at 6.62%, indicating a recent peak that surpassed the preceding 19 weeks. This trend suggests a potential growing impact of respiratory infections on overall mortality, which could warrant increased healthcare resources and public health interventions to manage and mitigate the spread of these diseases.
