Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has exhibited a typical diurnal pattern, starting moderately warm in the early hours, cooling slightly towards dawn, and then increasing significantly by the afternoon, likely contributing to a rise in discomfort levels due to heat. Humidity levels were high throughout the period, peaking during the early morning hours, which could have led to very muggy conditions, especially when combined with the higher temperatures. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively steady, with a slight increasing trend in the middle of the period, indicating stable weather conditions without significant weather fronts moving through the area. Wind speeds were generally light with some variability, which likely provided little relief from the heat and humidity. The wind direction varied significantly throughout the day, suggesting the influence of local weather patterns rather than a dominant weather system.
