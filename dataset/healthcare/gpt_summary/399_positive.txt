Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a fluctuating but overall increasing trend in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a notable rise in the last week reaching 1.33% against an average of 6.26%. The proportion of Influenza A detections has been consistently higher than Influenza B, culminating in a significant spike to 0.90% in the most recent week, suggesting a possible surge in Influenza A activity. Conversely, Influenza B showed an initial dominance but has since remained relatively stable with a slight increase to 0.43% in the last week. The total number of specimens tested increased over the period, with a peak in week 20, which may indicate an increased demand for influenza testing services. The observed trends suggest a potential strain on healthcare resources due to increased influenza activity and highlight the need for enhanced influenza surveillance and possibly increased vaccination efforts.
