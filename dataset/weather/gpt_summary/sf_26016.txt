Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a moderate fluctuation in temperature, with a noticeable warming trend during the daytime hours, followed by a cooling trend in the evening. Humidity levels showed significant variability, with very high levels during the early morning and late night, which may have contributed to foggy conditions, particularly given San Francisco's coastal climate. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with only minor fluctuations that are not indicative of any major weather fronts moving in or out of the area. Wind speeds were generally light but increased significantly towards the end of the period, suggesting the arrival of a more energetic weather system. The wind direction was variable throughout the day, with a shift to stronger winds from the north-northeast at the end, which could lead to cooler and clearer conditions if this pattern persists.
