Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 exhibited a generally upward trend, closing higher at 4518.44 from an initial 4439.26, suggesting a positive sentiment among equity investors. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, fluctuated within a narrow range but ended slightly higher at 15.77 compared to 14.84 initially, indicating a mild increase in market uncertainty. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 also showed an overall increase, which may reflect a global confidence in markets despite some daily dips. Commodity prices such as Gold Futures remained relatively stable with slight fluctuations, closing at 1933.50 from a starting point of 1931.30, while Crude Oil Futures increased notably, suggesting higher energy demand or supply concerns. The currency markets saw the USD strengthening against the JPY but varied little against the EUR and CNY, which could influence export dynamics and multinational earnings.
