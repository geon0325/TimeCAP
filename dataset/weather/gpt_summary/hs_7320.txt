Over the last 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable fluctuation in temperature, peaking during the afternoon and cooling towards the early morning, indicative of a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels varied significantly, reaching saturation at one point, which suggests the presence of fog or heavy dew; however, a general decrease in humidity followed, which is conducive to more comfortable conditions. Air pressure showed minor fluctuations but maintained values that are generally considered to be within the normal range, and the lack of any drastic changes suggests stable atmospheric conditions. Wind speeds were mostly light to gentle, with a brief period of increased wind activity, and the wind direction was variable, with a tendency towards southerly and southeasterly directions, which is common for this region. Such wind patterns, combined with the observed humidity and temperature trends, could indicate the passage of a weak frontal system through the area.
