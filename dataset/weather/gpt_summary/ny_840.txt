Over the past 24 hours, New York City experienced stable temperatures initially, which then saw a moderate decline before slightly rising again, indicating a relatively typical diurnal temperature variation. However, the humidity levels fluctuated significantly, starting with relatively high values, rising even higher which could have led to a feeling of increased mugginess, before plummeting drastically, suggesting a front may have passed through the area. The air pressure remained steady for most of the period but showed an increase towards the end, which often correlates with the arrival of clearer conditions. Wind speeds varied from moderate to calm, with a noticeable uptick later on, which could affect wind chill and make the outdoor temperature feel cooler. The wind direction was predominantly from the northwest, shifting slightly, which is typical for the passage of a frontal system and could have contributed to the observed changes in humidity and temperature.
