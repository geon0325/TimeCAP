Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual warming trend with temperatures peaking in the later hours, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels remained high throughout the period, with a saturation point reached at one point, suggesting the potential for fog or mist, particularly in the early hours when temperatures were lower. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable with only minor fluctuations, implying steady weather conditions without significant front movements or storm systems impacting the area. Wind speeds varied moderately, with periods of calmer conditions interspersed with occasional breezy moments; however, no strong wind events were reported. The prevailing wind direction was generally from the northwest, which is characteristic for the region and may contribute to coastal upwelling and the advection of cooler, marine air inland.
