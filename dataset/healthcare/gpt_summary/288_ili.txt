Over the past 20 weeks, the data indicates a gradual increase in the ratio of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) patients, surpassing the baseline of 2.9% in recent weeks. This uptick suggests a growing incidence of ILI within the population, with the most significant increases observed in the 25-49 and 65 or more age groups. The youngest age group (0-4) also showed a noticeable rise in ILI cases, which could indicate higher transmission rates among children. Despite the overall rise, the age groups 5-24 and 50-64 maintained a relatively stable number of ILI patients, albeit with minor fluctuations. The ascending trend in ILI ratios, particularly in vulnerable age brackets, may lead to increased healthcare resource allocation to manage and contain the spread of influenza-like illnesses.
