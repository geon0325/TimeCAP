Over the past 24 hours, the temperature in Houston has experienced a general upward trend, indicating a warming pattern that peaked during the latter part of the period. Humidity levels started moderately high and then increased to very high levels, suggesting the presence of considerable moisture in the air, which could be indicative of a muggy atmosphere that later gave way to slightly drier conditions. Air pressure has shown a slight but steady decrease, which could be associated with the approach of a low-pressure system, potentially leading to changing weather conditions such as increased cloudiness or precipitation. Wind speeds were mostly consistent with a gentle breeze, with a slight increase observed later on, which could contribute to the dispersion of humidity and influence local temperature feels. The wind direction remained predominantly southerly, which in Houston often brings in warmth and moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, impacting local weather conditions.
