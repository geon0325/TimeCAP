Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperature has shown a gradual upward trend, indicating a warming pattern throughout the day. Humidity levels have remained consistently high, nearing saturation for much of the period, which could contribute to a feeling of mugginess and may increase the likelihood of fog, particularly during the cooler early hours. Air pressure has been slowly increasing, suggesting stable or improving weather conditions. Wind speeds have been mostly light to moderate with little variation, while wind direction has shifted from westerly to southerly, which could influence temperature and humidity levels as different air masses move into the area. The combination of high humidity, increasing temperatures, and stable air pressure points to a possibly warm and humid day ahead without significant wind chill.
