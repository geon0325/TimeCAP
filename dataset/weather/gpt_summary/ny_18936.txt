Over the past 24 hours in New York City, there has been a noticeable upward trend in temperature, transitioning from chilly conditions to milder weather. Humidity levels experienced significant fluctuations, peaking during the morning hours, which likely resulted in a feeling of dampness, before decreasing and then rising again towards the end of the period. Air pressure showed variability with a notable decrease mid-period, followed by a rise, which could indicate the passage of a frontal system through the area. Wind speeds varied from calm to moderate gusts, with the highest speeds observed during the afternoon, potentially contributing to a wind chill effect that made it feel cooler than the actual temperature. Wind direction was predominantly from the south to south-west, suggesting a flow of milder air into the region, which is consistent with the increase in temperature observed.
