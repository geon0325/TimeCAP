Over the last 24 hours in Houston, the temperature demonstrated a typical diurnal cycle with a cool dawn and a warmer afternoon, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before gradually cooling down again. Humidity levels varied inversely with temperature, indicating higher moisture levels in the cooler early morning hours and lower levels during the warmer afternoon, which can enhance the comfort levels despite the heat. Air pressure remained relatively high and stable throughout the period, suggesting a sustained period of fair weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with some increase during the day, which could help in dispersing pollutants and providing some relief from the heat. The wind direction was predominantly from the northeast, shifting more easterly and then to southeasterly later in the day, which might bring in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, potentially affecting local humidity and precipitation patterns.
