Over the past 20 market days, the S&P 500 showed a general upward trend with intermittent fluctuations but ended with a slight decline, indicating a potential market correction after a period of growth. The VIX, or Volatility Index, experienced a decrease from highs of 33.09 to levels around 22, indicating a reduction in market volatility and investor fear, but recent spikes suggest renewed uncertainty. International markets also witnessed volatility with the Nikkei 225 showing a significant increase before a sharp drop in the latest trading session, and the FTSE 100 mirrored this pattern with a strong rally followed by a recent downturn. Gold futures faced a downward trend, reflecting reduced demand for safe-haven assets, whereas Crude Oil futures generally increased, pointing towards a potential uptick in economic activity and energy demand. Currency exchange rates remained relatively stable with minor appreciation of the Euro and Japanese Yen against the US Dollar, and the USD/CNY pair showed slight fluctuations, maintaining stability around the 6.45 to 6.49 range.
