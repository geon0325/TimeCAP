Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a gradual decrease in temperature, reaching its lowest point at night before slightly rising again. Concurrently, humidity levels remained high throughout the majority of the day, only starting to decrease significantly in the late afternoon and evening. Air pressure experienced a steady increase during the first half of the period, indicating stable weather conditions, but it plateaued towards the end with a slight decrease thereafter. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, intensifying as the day progressed, and the predominant wind direction was northerly, with occasional shifts to the northeast and northwest. These conditions are typical of a stable weather pattern, but the rising wind speed towards the end of the period could suggest the approach of a weather system that may alter the current conditions.
