Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced a slight upward trend in temperature, indicating a gradual warming. Humidity levels have been high, often reaching saturation, which could suggest a likelihood of fog or precipitation. Air pressure has been decreasing, which is typically associated with the approach of a low-pressure system that could lead to unsettled weather conditions. Wind speeds have been mostly moderate but showed some increase during the period, which may contribute to the dispersal of humidity and potential cloud cover. The predominant wind direction has shifted from easterly to southerly, which in Houston can often bring in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, affecting local weather patterns.
