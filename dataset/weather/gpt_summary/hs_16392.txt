Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a notable fluctuation in temperature, with values peaking in the afternoon hours, as is typical for this subtropical location. Humidity levels have shown a decreasing trend throughout the day, which, coupled with increasing temperatures, suggests a less muggy atmosphere moving into the evening. Air pressure has remained relatively stable, with a slight increase mid-day, indicating steady weather conditions without the immediate presence of significant frontal systems. Wind speeds have been mild to moderate and have slightly increased toward the end of the analyzed period, which may contribute to a gentle cooling effect.
