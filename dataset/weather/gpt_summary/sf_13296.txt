Over the last 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have exhibited a clear diurnal pattern, with a peak during the daytime hours and a gradual decrease through the night, reaching the lowest point just before dawn. Humidity levels have remained relatively high throughout the period, with some fluctuations, suggesting a presence of moisture in the air that could be conducive to cloud formation or fog, particularly during the early morning hours. Atmospheric pressure was stable for most of the day but showed a significant decrease in the latter hours, which could indicate an approaching weather system or front that may alter current conditions. Wind speeds varied, with higher gusts observed during certain hours, and winds were predominantly flowing from a westerly direction, a typical pattern for the San Francisco area that can influence coastal fog and temperature. Overall, the combination of these weather indicators suggests a typical pattern for the region, but the recent drop in pressure could be a precursor to changing weather conditions in the near term.
