Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable decline in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the ratio of positive specimens decreasing from a peak of 14.90% to 1.02%. Influenza A has consistently been the predominant strain, although its incidence has also fallen sharply, from a high of 14.77% of specimens to a current low of 0.36%. Conversely, the ratio of positive specimens for Influenza B has shown a slight increase over time, despite the overall downward trend in total positive cases, suggesting a relative, albeit minor, rise in Influenza B activity toward the end of the 20-week period. The overall average positivity rate of 6.26% over the period suggests that influenza has been circulating at moderate levels, but the recent decline in positive cases could indicate a waning of the flu season or the effectiveness of public health interventions. Healthcare systems may experience a reduction in flu-related demand, allowing for a potential reallocation of resources to other areas as the incidence of influenza decreases.
