Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures exhibited a warming trend, reaching their peak in the late afternoon before decreasing slightly towards the evening. Relative humidity levels were high and even reached saturation at several points, particularly during the early morning hours, which may have led to foggy conditions or dew. Air pressure remained relatively stable but showed a slight downward trend, suggesting a possible weak weather system moving through the area. Wind speeds were generally low to moderate throughout the period, with some variability in speed and a notable shift in direction from easterly to northerly and then predominantly easterly again. The combination of high humidity, rising temperatures, and variable winds could have resulted in muggy conditions, with the potential for local weather phenomena such as sea breezes or afternoon thunderstorms.
