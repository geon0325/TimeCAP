Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, with the coolest conditions recorded in the early morning hours. Humidity levels have shown significant fluctuations, with periods of both very high and moderate humidity, which suggests the presence of varying atmospheric conditions that could influence cloud formation and precipitation patterns. Air pressure remained relatively stable for much of the time, but there was a notable dip followed by a significant increase towards the end of the period, indicating a passing weather system. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, but there was a sharp increase in the latter part of the day, which could signal the approach of a more dynamic weather system. The wind direction was variable throughout the day, predominantly coming from the west and north, which is typical for coastal cities like San Francisco, with shifts in direction possibly affecting local temperature and fog distribution.
