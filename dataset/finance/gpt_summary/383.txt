The VIX, a measure of market volatility, has gradually decreased from 27.29 to 22.65, indicating a reduction in investor anxiety and potential market risk perceptions. Internationally, the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have shown some volatility, with the Nikkei experiencing a notable drop mid-period before partially recovering, and the FTSE 100 struggling to maintain upward momentum, reflecting mixed sentiment in global markets. Gold Futures have seen a significant rally, moving from 1798.20 to 2051.50, which may be attributed to investors seeking safe-haven assets amidst ongoing economic uncertainties.
