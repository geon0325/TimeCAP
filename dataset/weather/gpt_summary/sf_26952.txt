Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature leading up to the early morning hours, followed by a significant rise during the day, which is typical for the region's coastal climate. Humidity levels began relatively low but increased overnight, peaking in the early morning, indicative of possible morning fog which is common in this area, and then sharply decreased throughout the day, suggesting clearer conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase in the early morning, which could have contributed to steadier weather patterns. Wind speeds were moderate to light, decreasing over time, with a notable shift in wind direction from predominantly westerly to variable, including a period with easterly winds. This variability in wind direction could have influenced the dispersion of any fog or low clouds, affecting local weather conditions such as temperature and humidity.
