Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a slight but consistent decline in the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia to the total number of deaths, decreasing from 7.49% to 5.34%, which is lower than the average ratio of 7.84%. This trend suggests a relative decrease in deaths from these causes compared to overall mortality. The total number of deaths has also marginally decreased over this period, from 57,077 to 51,397. However, deaths from influenza have significantly dropped from 480 to 6, indicating a substantial reduction in influenza-associated mortality. Despite this positive trend in influenza mortality, pneumonia-related deaths have shown a less pronounced decrease, from 3,797 to 2,737, which still presents a challenge for healthcare providers managing respiratory illnesses.
