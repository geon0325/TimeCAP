The time-series data for Influenza-like Illness (ILI) over the last 20 weeks shows a marked decline in the ratio of ILI patients, with the initial weeks reflecting a percentage well above the baseline threshold, indicating a significant ILI presence within the population. This trend is consistent across all age groups, with the highest number of ILI cases initially reported in the youngest age bracket (0-4 years), which gradually decreased over the period. The most substantial decrease in ILI percentages was within the first five weeks, after which the decline plateaued to rates below the baseline, suggesting a waning ILI activity. With the ratio of ILI patients now below the threshold, the data suggests a reduction in the burden of ILI on the healthcare system. However, continued monitoring is essential to detect any possible resurgence, and healthcare providers should remain vigilant, especially for the most vulnerable age groups such as the young and the elderly.
