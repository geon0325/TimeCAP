Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature demonstrated a typical diurnal pattern, starting warm in the early hours, gradually cooling until sunrise, and then warming up again to reach peak temperatures in the late afternoon. Relative humidity levels showed an inverse relationship to temperature, with higher humidity prevalent during the cooler morning hours and decreasing as temperatures rose, indicating possible discomfort during midday due to heat combined with moderate humidity. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with only slight fluctuations that suggest stable weather conditions without significant systems moving through the area. Wind speeds varied from calm to moderate breezes, with some increase during the day, which could offer some relief from the heat. The wind direction was predominantly from the south to southeast, which is typical for Houston and could contribute to bringing in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, affecting humidity levels.
