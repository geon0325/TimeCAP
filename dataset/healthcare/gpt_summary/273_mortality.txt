Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a slight decrease in the total number of deaths, but the number of deaths from influenza and pneumonia has not followed a consistent trend. The ratio of mortality specifically from influenza and pneumonia to the total number of deaths has been below the average of 7.84%, ranging from 5.95% to 6.58% over the period. Notably, deaths from influenza have decreased significantly in the latter weeks, while pneumonia-related deaths have seen a slight uptick. This suggests that while overall mortality is stable or slightly declining, the burden of pneumonia remains significant and is increasing as a proportion of total deaths. These trends could indicate a need for continued vigilance in pneumonia prevention and management within the healthcare system, especially considering the fluctuating and currently increasing impact of pneumonia on mortality.
