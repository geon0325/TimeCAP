Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced relatively stable temperatures with a slight cooling trend followed by a modest warming period. Humidity levels were high, peaking at saturation and remaining elevated throughout the period, which could have contributed to periods of fog or mist, particularly characteristic of the city's microclimate. Air pressure varied slightly but stayed within a range indicative of stable weather conditions, without significant fluctuations that might suggest the approach of a new weather system. Wind speeds were mostly light to gentle, with some variability in speed but no significant gusts, indicating a calm wind pattern. The wind direction shifted throughout the day, including a notable change from primarily southerly to westerly and then veering to easterly and northerly, which could affect coastal fog dispersion and temperature variation in localized areas.
