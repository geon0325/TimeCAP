Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperature has experienced mild fluctuations, generally maintaining a cooler trend indicative of typical regional climate conditions. Humidity levels have remained high, suggesting a moist atmosphere that could contribute to the potential for fog, especially during the early hours when humidity peaked. Air pressure saw a significant increase in the middle of the time series, which may have been associated with a transient high-pressure system, often leading to clearer skies following its passage. Wind speeds were predominantly light and variable, with occasional moderate gusts, which would have minimal impact on day-to-day activities but may have contributed to a slight wind chill effect during cooler hours. The wind direction shifted throughout the period, ranging from westerly to northerly, reflecting the dynamic nature of coastal weather patterns that are influenced by both inland and maritime factors.
