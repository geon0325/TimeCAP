Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a marked increase in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the ratio growing from 1.70% to 26.24%. This upward trend is primarily driven by a significant rise in Influenza A detections, which grew from a 1.24% positivity rate to 25.36%, indicating a possible Influenza A-dominated flu season. In contrast, Influenza B has maintained a relatively stable positivity rate, fluctuating minimally around an average of 0.50%, and peaking at 0.97% in recent weeks. The total number of specimens tested has also increased over the period, reaching a peak in the last week at 54,061 tests, which may reflect a response to the growing number of cases and heightened surveillance. Given these trends, the healthcare system may experience increased demand for medical resources, including hospital beds, antiviral medications, and healthcare personnel, necessitating enhanced preparedness and response strategies to manage the potential surge in influenza cases.
