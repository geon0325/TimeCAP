Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a gradual increase in temperature, indicating a warming trend throughout the day. However, humidity levels showed a notable decrease as the day progressed, which typically suggests drier air moving into the area. Air pressure experienced slight fluctuations but remained relatively stable, with a marginal increase towards the end of the period, which could signal a period of settled weather ahead. Wind speeds stayed consistently light, which would not contribute significantly to any immediate changes in weather patterns. The wind direction varied considerably, beginning with a northeasterly direction, shifting to a westerly flow, and ending with an apparent shift towards southeasterly, which may suggest the movement of a weather system through the region.
