Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature, exhibiting a general increase during the daylight hours followed by a cooling trend in the evening, which is typical of a diurnal pattern. Humidity levels have varied significantly, with particularly high levels recorded during the early morning hours, suggesting the potential for early morning fog or dew. Air pressure remained relatively stable with only slight variations, indicating steady weather conditions without the presence of significant frontal systems. Wind speeds experienced some fluctuations with an increase towards the latter part of the period, which could contribute to a change in weather patterns or increased wind chill effects. The predominant wind direction was easterly to northeasterly, which is common for this region and could be associated with moisture transport from the Gulf of Mexico, potentially affecting local humidity and precipitation patterns.
