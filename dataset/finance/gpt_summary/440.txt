Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a general uptrend with some volatility, reaching a peak of 3534.22 before retracing to 3390.68, indicating a possible consolidation in the equity market. The VIX, or Volatility Index, has increased towards the end of the period, moving from 26.37 to 33.35, suggesting that investors are anticipating greater market volatility ahead. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 indices have both experienced fluctuations but ended the period lower, possibly reflecting investor uncertainty in Asian and European markets. Gold Futures have remained relatively stable, with a slight uptrend from 1887.50 to 1908.80, which could indicate a flight to safety among investors. The exchange rates have been comparatively stable, with minor fluctuations in EUR/USD, USD/JPY, and USD/CNY, suggesting a period of calm in currency markets despite the volatility observed in equity and commodity spaces.
