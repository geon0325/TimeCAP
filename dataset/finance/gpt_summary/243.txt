Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a steady upward trend, increasing by 3.93% from 3191.14 to 3316.81, suggesting a positive market sentiment. Despite the S&P 500's growth, the VIX (Volatility Index) has remained relatively low and stable, closing slightly lower at 12.32, indicating that market volatility expectations have not significantly changed. International indices like the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have experienced some fluctuations, with the Nikkei showing a slight uptick on the last day after a dip, while the FTSE 100 ended on a slight decline, signaling mixed performance in global markets. Gold Futures have seen a general increase, ending the period at 1549.00, up by 5.18%, which could reflect investors' hedging against potential market risks. Crude Oil Futures experienced volatility with a notable spike and subsequent drop in prices, closing at 58.52, which, along with relatively stable major currency pairs EUR/USD and USD/JPY, suggests that forex and commodity markets are currently not experiencing drastic changes, whereas the USD/CNY pair showed a slight depreciation of the Chinese Yuan against the USD.
