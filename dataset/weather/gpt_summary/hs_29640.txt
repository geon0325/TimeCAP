Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature exhibited a typical diurnal pattern, with cooler conditions at night that gradually warmed up to reach a peak in the late afternoon hours. Relative humidity showed an inverse relationship to temperature, with higher humidity levels during the cooler night and early morning hours, decreasing as temperatures rose. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight fluctuation in the middle of the period, which is not indicative of significant weather changes. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate throughout the period, with a gradual increase observed later in the day, suggesting a possible increase in weather activity. The wind direction was predominantly from the south to the southeast, which is typical for Houston and may have contributed to the gradual warming trend and moisture levels observed due to the flow of air from the Gulf of Mexico.
