Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 exhibited volatility with an overall downtrend, closing lower by 5.43% from its starting position, indicative of investor caution and potential concerns about economic conditions. The VIX, which measures market volatility, saw an increase, peaking at 36.45 before settling lower, reflecting heightened investor anxiety and market instability. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 also faced declines, with the Nikkei dropping by 7.64% and the FTSE 100 by 7.46%, signaling broader global market pressures. Commodity prices such as Gold and Crude Oil Futures moved inversely to equity markets, with Gold Futures increasing by 8.83% as investors likely sought safe-haven assets, while Crude Oil Futures surged by 18.05%, possibly due to geopolitical tensions or supply concerns. Currency markets showed the euro and the yen strengthening against the dollar, with the EUR/USD rebounding to 1.11 and the USD/JPY peaking at 115.91, which could suggest a flight to traditional reserve currencies amidst market uncertainty.
