Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, indicative of a potential cold front passage or radiational cooling overnight. Concurrently, humidity levels have shown significant variability with a marked increase during the cooler early morning hours, potentially leading to fog formation or dew. Air pressure has been steadily increasing through the period, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system moving into the area, which is generally associated with stable and clear weather conditions. Wind speeds have been light to moderate, with the wind direction predominantly from the north and northwest, which is consistent with cooler, drier air being ushered into the region. The combination of these factors points to a stable and cooler weather pattern settling over Houston, with the possibility of clear skies and lower humidity following the initial increase in the morning.
