Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature with a general cooling trend towards the early hours of the period, which then reversed into a warming trend later on. Humidity levels have shown a gradual increase throughout the day, suggesting a buildup of moisture in the air that could potentially lead to cloud formation or fog, especially towards the end of the 24-hour period. Air pressure remained remarkably stable for most of the day, with a slight decrease towards the end, which might indicate an approaching weather system or front. Wind speeds were consistently light, which would have minimal impact on immediate weather conditions, but a gradual shift in wind direction from northerly to more easterly could be indicative of changing weather patterns. Overall, the combination of increasing humidity and a slight decrease in air pressure could suggest that Houston may experience some weather changes, possibly leading to overcast skies or precipitation in the following hours or days.
