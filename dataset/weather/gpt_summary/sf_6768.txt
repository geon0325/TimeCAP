Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a noticeable decline in temperature, indicating a cooling trend that transitioned from warmer to cooler conditions. Humidity levels remained exceptionally high throughout the period, suggesting a very moist air mass was in place, which could have resulted in overcast skies or fog, particularly common in this coastal city. Air pressure varied slightly but showed a significant drop at one point, possibly associated with the passage of a weather front or a localized low-pressure system that may have influenced weather conditions. Wind speeds were mostly light, which is typical for San Francisco's microclimates, and there was little variation in wind direction, indicating a relatively stable weather pattern with no significant frontal activity. Overall, the combination of high humidity, light winds, and the cooling trend could have led to foggy conditions, especially in the mornings and evenings, and the air pressure drop might have been related to transient weather events such as coastal eddies or passing clouds.
