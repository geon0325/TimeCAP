The VIX, which is inversely related to market confidence, has decreased from 19.98 to 15.38, supporting the rise in the S&P 500 by signaling a decline in market volatility and increased investor confidence.

Both gold and crude oil futures saw fluctuations, with gold futures slightly declining, suggesting a shift in investor preference towards riskier assets, while crude oil futures increased, reflecting potential market expectations of an economic upswing. Currency markets showed the euro and yen slightly appreciating against the dollar, while the Chinese yuan remained relatively stable against the dollar, which could indicate nuanced shifts in currency dynamics potentially influenced by regional economic policies and trade relations.
