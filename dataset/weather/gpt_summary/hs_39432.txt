Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a slight upward trend in temperature, indicating a mild warming pattern. Humidity levels varied significantly, reaching saturation at one point, which could have led to fog or mist formation, particularly when combined with the relatively stable air pressure during that time. Air pressure has shown a gradual decrease throughout the period, suggesting an increased likelihood of changing weather patterns, possibly leading to unsettled conditions. Wind speeds have been mostly moderate, with some fluctuations, but there was a notable shift in wind direction from primarily easterly to variable directions, including northerly and northwesterly, which could signal the approach of a weather front. These factors together point towards a dynamic weather situation in Houston, with the potential for developing weather events such as rain or storms.
