Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia to the total number of deaths, with a peak of 14.15% in the second week, significantly above the average of 7.84%. The most significant increase in deaths attributed to Influenza occurred in week 15 with 887 deaths, which is a substantial rise compared to the average of the preceding weeks. However, in the following weeks, there was a marked decrease in Influenza deaths, indicating a potentially transient spike. Pneumonia deaths showed a high in weeks 11 to 14, with over 9,000 deaths each week, which then steadily decreased but remained above the initial weekly values. This data suggests a need for increased healthcare resources during certain periods, particularly for managing Pneumonia, and highlights the importance of ongoing surveillance and response strategies for these respiratory conditions.
