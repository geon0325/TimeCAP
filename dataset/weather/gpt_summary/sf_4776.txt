Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there was a noticeable fluctuation in temperature, with a general trend of cooling overnight and warming during the day, which is typical for the region's coastal climate. Relative humidity experienced significant variations, reaching its peak during the cooler early morning hours and dropping sharply as temperatures rose later in the day, indicative of the diurnal patterns often seen in Mediterranean climates. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, suggesting a period of steady weather conditions without the immediate influence of strong frontal systems. Wind speed varied considerably, with stronger winds in the early hours that gradually subsided to calm conditions, before picking up again towards the end of the period; this could contribute to changes in temperature and humidity levels. Wind direction was predominantly westerly, with some shifts, which aligns with the prevailing wind patterns for the region and could influence coastal fog development and dispersal.
