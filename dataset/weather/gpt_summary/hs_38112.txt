Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before starting to decline towards the evening. Humidity levels were notably high throughout the day, with a peak at 100% suggesting the possibility of fog or mist in the early hours. Air pressure showed a decreasing trend, indicating the potential for changing weather conditions, such as an approaching weather system. Wind speeds varied, with some higher gusts observed, which could contribute to cooler perceived temperatures and the dispersal of any humidity or fog. The prevailing wind direction was primarily from the south, shifting slightly throughout the day, which is typical for Houston's weather patterns and may have contributed to the higher humidity levels due to the transport of moist air from the Gulf of Mexico.
