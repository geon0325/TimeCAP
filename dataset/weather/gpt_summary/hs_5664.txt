Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a slight decrease in temperature followed by a gradual increase, indicating a typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels reached saturation at certain points during this period but generally showed a decreasing trend, suggesting the possibility of early morning fog that cleared as the day progressed. Air pressure has remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, indicating steady weather conditions without the immediate approach of significant weather systems. Wind speeds were generally mild to moderate, with occasional periods of calm winds, and the predominant wind direction was from the southeast, which is typical for Houston and can bring moisture from the Gulf of Mexico into the area. The combination of high humidity, mild temperatures, and southeasterly winds suggests a muggy and warm weather pattern for the region.
