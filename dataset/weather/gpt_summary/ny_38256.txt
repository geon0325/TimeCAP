Over the last 24 hours, New York City has experienced a slight decrease in temperature, with a gradual cooling trend throughout the period. Humidity levels have been variable, with several instances of 100% humidity, suggesting the possibility of fog or mist, particularly during the cooler early morning hours when the temperature was at its lowest. Air pressure has been steadily decreasing, which could indicate an approaching weather system that might bring precipitation or a change in weather patterns. Wind speeds have been generally light to moderate, with some fluctuations, and the wind direction has varied, showing no strong prevailing wind pattern during this time. The combination of high humidity, decreasing temperatures, and falling air pressure may lead to overcast conditions, and the potential for rain or drizzle cannot be ruled out.
