Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual decrease in temperature from its peak during the day towards a cooler night, followed by a warming trend as the day progressed. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, reaching very high levels during the cooler early morning hours, which could have caused instances of fog or a muggy feeling, then dropped markedly as temperatures rose. Air pressure saw some variation with a notable increase in the middle of the time period, suggesting the possible passage of a weather front through the area. Wind speeds were generally light with occasional calm periods, but there was no dominant wind direction, indicating a lack of a steady weather system influencing the region. The variability in wind direction, along with changes in air pressure and humidity, could have contributed to unpredictable weather patterns, possibly affecting outdoor activities and local aviation.
