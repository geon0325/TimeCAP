Over the past 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with an overall downward trend, opening at 3276.24 and closing at 3128.21, reflecting broader market uncertainty. This is mirrored by the VIX, which has risen from 16.28 to 27.85, indicating increased market volatility and investor anxiety. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 indices also experienced declines, with the Nikkei dropping from 23215.71 to 22605.41, and the FTSE 100 from 7480.70 to 7017.90, signaling a global negative sentiment in equity markets. Gold Futures have bucked this trend, rising from 1569.20 to 1646.90, which typically suggests a flight to safety as investors seek stable assets. Exchange rates show the USD strengthening against the JPY and weakening against the CNY, with the EUR/USD remaining relatively stable, which may indicate a mixed perception of the dollar's safe-haven status and shifts in trade dynamics or monetary policy expectations.
