Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant increase in the percentage of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) patients, surpassing the baseline threshold crucial for monitoring influenza activity. This upsurge is particularly pronounced in the age groups 5-24 and 25-49, which could indicate higher transmission rates among school-aged children and adults, potentially leading to increased spread within communities. The highest ratio of ILI patients was observed in the most recent weeks, suggesting a peak in influenza activity that may strain healthcare resources due to the elevated demand for medical attention. Although all age groups have shown an increase in ILI cases, the consistent rise in the oldest age bracket (65 or more) is concerning as it may correlate with more severe outcomes and a greater need for hospitalization. The current trend indicates an active influenza season that requires public health vigilance and may necessitate the reinforcement of preventive measures, such as vaccination and public awareness campaigns, to mitigate the impact on the healthcare system.
