Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature experienced a noticeable increase towards the latter part of the day, after a period of slight fluctuation. Humidity levels showed a peak, reaching saturation, before decreasing significantly as temperatures rose, suggesting a possible clearance of earlier moisture in the air. Air pressure remained fairly stable with minor variations, indicating no significant weather fronts moving through the area during the observed period. Wind speed varied with a notable increase at one point, which could have contributed to the dispersal of humidity, followed by a general decrease towards the end of the period. The wind direction shifted from predominantly southerly to variable with a more northerly component at one point, which may have influenced the change in temperature and humidity levels observed.
