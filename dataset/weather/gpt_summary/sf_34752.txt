Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature, exhibiting a warming trend during the daytime followed by a cooling trend at night, which is typical for coastal cities due to the urban heat island effect and oceanic influence. Humidity has seen a significant decrease through the day, likely due to increasing temperatures and perhaps the influence of local land-sea interactions, leading to drier conditions by the late afternoon. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight variation, indicating no major weather fronts passing through the area that would typically bring drastic changes in weather conditions. The wind speed was generally low, including periods of calm, suggesting a high-pressure system nearby, which is often associated with settled weather conditions. Wind direction varied widely throughout the day, with a notable shift from predominantly northerly winds to a westerly direction, which could be associated with the movement of local weather systems or sea breezes typical for coastal areas.
