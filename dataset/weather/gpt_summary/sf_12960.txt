Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature, with a general cooling trend during the earlier hours followed by a gradual increase towards the latter part of the time period. Humidity levels remained relatively high throughout, which could have contributed to a perception of chilliness despite the temperature changes. Air pressure showed a slight declining trend before stabilizing, indicating the potential for changing weather patterns such as increased windiness or the approach of a weather front. Wind speeds varied moderately, with occasional increases that could have been noticeable to residents and affected outdoor activities. The wind direction was predominantly westerly, with some variability, which is typical for the coastal climate of San Francisco and can influence the distribution of marine fog and coastal temperatures.
