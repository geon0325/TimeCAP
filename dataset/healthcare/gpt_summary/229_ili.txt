Over the last 20 weeks, the data reveals a consistent increase in the number of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases across all age groups, with the most significant rise observed in the youngest (0-4 years) and the 5-24 age brackets. Although the ratio of ILI patients started below the baseline threshold for an influenza outbreak, it has gradually risen, indicating a growing prevalence of ILI symptoms within the patient population. The upward trend in the ratio of ILI patients suggests an expanding impact on healthcare services, potentially necessitating increased resource allocation for managing ILI cases. The data also points to a sustained elevation in the overall number of patients presenting with ILI symptoms in the recent weeks, which could lead to heightened demands on healthcare providers and facilities. Given that the ILI ratio has now surpassed the baseline, public health agencies may need to consider implementing or reinforcing preventative measures to manage the spread of influenza-like illnesses.
