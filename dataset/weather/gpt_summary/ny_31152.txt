Over the past 24 hours in New York City, the temperature experienced a gradual increase, reaching its peak before slightly declining, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels showed a marked decrease through the day, which is consistent with the rising temperatures, but a notable spike in humidity occurred overnight. Air pressure decreased gradually over the period, suggesting a potential change in weather patterns or the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds were generally light but increased towards the end of the period, with some variability in intensity that could influence wind chill and the perceived temperature. The wind direction was predominantly from the south-southwest, shifting more towards the west later on, which could have implications for any maritime or aviation activities due to the change in prevailing winds.
