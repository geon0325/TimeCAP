During the same period, humidity levels have shown notable variations, with a significant decrease in the latter half of the timeframe, suggesting drier air moving into the area. Air pressure has been generally increasing, pointing towards the development of a high-pressure system that could lead to more stable and calm weather conditions. Wind speeds have been moderate with some fluctuations, and wind direction has been variable, though predominantly coming from the north and east, which may have contributed to the cooler and drier air.
