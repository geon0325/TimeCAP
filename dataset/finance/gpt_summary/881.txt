Over the past 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a general upward trend, increasing from 3825.33 to 4130.29, suggesting a growing investor confidence or positive market sentiment. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, has correspondingly trended downwards from 26.70 to 21.33, indicating a reduction in expected market volatility and potentially increased stability. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 indices have also risen, although the Nikkei showed some fluctuation, both indicating strength in international markets. Gold futures, after initially dropping to a low of 1704.50, have rebounded to 1762.90, which might reflect a hedging behavior against potential market risks. The exchange rates for EUR/USD and USD/CNY have remained relatively stable, while the USD/JPY has shown a weakening of the dollar in the recent days, dropping to 134.40 from a high of 138.97, which could influence export dynamics for U.S. and Japanese markets.
