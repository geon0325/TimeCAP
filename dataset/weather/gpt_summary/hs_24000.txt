Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have shown a pattern of a slight decrease during the early hours, followed by a significant increase through the afternoon, and then a gradual decline as the evening approached. Humidity levels experienced a marked increase, reaching saturation during the night and early morning hours, which could have led to fog or dew; this level dipped during the day, indicating drier conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight fluctuation, suggesting steady weather conditions without significant frontal changes. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate but increased notably in the evening, which could disperse humidity and lead to clearer conditions. The wind direction was variable, predominantly from the south to southwest, which is typical for Houston and may contribute to the area's warmth and moisture influx.
