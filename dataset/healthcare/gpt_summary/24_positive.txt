Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable decline in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza from a high of 18.47% to a low of 0.93%. The data shows a consistent downward trend in both Influenza A and B, with Influenza A decreasing from 12.99% to 0.58% and Influenza B from 5.48% to 0.35%. Despite the overall decrease, the ratio of positive specimens still exceeds the average of 6.26% in the early weeks, indicating a significant initial burden on healthcare resources. The recent ratios well below the average suggest a considerable reduction in influenza incidence, potentially leading to a decreased demand for influenza-related healthcare services. It is crucial for healthcare providers to monitor these trends for possible fluctuations and to manage resources accordingly to address other healthcare priorities.
