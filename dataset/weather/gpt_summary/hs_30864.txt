Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature followed by a noticeable increase, indicative of a typical diurnal temperature variation transitioning from cooler overnight temperatures to warmer daytime conditions. Humidity levels peaked during the early morning hours, likely contributing to a sensation of mugginess, but they decreased as temperatures rose, reflecting a common inverse relationship between temperature and relative humidity. Air pressure showed minor fluctuations, with a notable increase and subsequent decrease, suggesting the transient influence of a weather system passing through the area. Wind speed varied, with a period of increased wind activity that could have influenced the dispersal of humidity and other atmospheric particles. The wind direction was predominantly from the south, shifting slightly throughout the day, which is characteristic of the general circulation patterns in the region and can affect both temperature and humidity levels.
