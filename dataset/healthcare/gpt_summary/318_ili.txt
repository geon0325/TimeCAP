Over the last 20 weeks, the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data demonstrate a sustained increase in the ratio of ILI patients, indicating a growth in ILI prevalence across all age groups, yet remaining well below the baseline threshold for an influenza epidemic. The most significant rise in ILI cases has been observed in the youngest age group (0-4 years), suggesting that this population might be the most affected and could potentially be a key driver for the spread of ILI. Despite the overall increase, the ILI ratio has not reached epidemic levels, which may suggest that the healthcare system is not currently overburdened by ILI cases. However, consistent monitoring is warranted, as the upward trend in ILI ratios, if sustained or intensified, could indicate an approaching epidemic that could strain healthcare resources. The age-group-specific ILI trends highlight the need for targeted public health interventions and surveillance, particularly for the most vulnerable populations such as young children and the elderly.
