Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature, with a general cooling trend followed by a warming period towards the latter part of the day. Relative humidity levels remained high throughout the day, with a peak in the later evening, indicating potential for a more moist and possibly foggy night. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a significant drop in the evening, which could be associated with the development of a transient weather system, potentially bringing changes in weather conditions. Wind speeds varied moderately, with a sharp increase in wind speed observed towards the end of the period, which, when combined with the drop in air pressure, suggests the increased likelihood of windier and possibly unsettled weather conditions. Wind direction was predominantly westerly, with some variability, which is typical for San Francisco due to its coastal location and could influence the local climate, particularly in terms of bringing in marine air and affecting fog patterns.
