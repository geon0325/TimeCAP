Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable upward trend in the ratio of mortality due to influenza or pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, peaking at 18.51% before declining to 11.15%, which still remains above the average ratio of 7.84%. This pattern suggests a significant increase in influenza or pneumonia-related mortality during the period, with the highest ratios correlating with the winter months, a typical season for such respiratory illnesses. Despite a recent decrease, the ratio is still higher than the average, indicating a sustained impact on the healthcare system which may be attributable to factors such as heightened virulence of the pathogens, increased susceptibility in the population, or possibly the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on respiratory health. The sharp spike in the ratio to 18.51% followed by a substantial decrease could also imply that the peak of the season has passed or that interventions have been effective. Healthcare systems should remain vigilant and continue preventive and treatment measures for vulnerable populations, given the substantial burden these diseases have imposed over the analyzed period.
