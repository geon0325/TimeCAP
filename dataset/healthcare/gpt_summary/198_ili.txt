Over the past 20 weeks, the data reveals an upward trend in the ratio of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) patients, with recent weeks showing ratios that exceed the baseline threshold, indicative of a heightened influenza situation. This increase is particularly pronounced in the age groups 5-24 and 25-49, where the numbers have surged significantly, suggesting that these populations are currently the most affected. The trend has also been reflected in the older age groups, albeit to a lesser extent. The peak of ILI activity appears to have been reached in the weeks just before the cutoff of the data, with a slight decrease in the ILI ratio observed subsequently, yet the levels remain above the baseline, signaling a continued public health concern. Healthcare systems may need to maintain or increase their readiness for dealing with ILI cases, focusing on the most impacted age groups, and possibly consider community interventions to address the spread of influenza.
