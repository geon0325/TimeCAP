The reported incidence of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) has shown a consistent decline over the last 20 weeks, indicating a downward trend in ILI cases. Initially, the ratio of ILI patients was well above the baseline threshold, suggesting a period of heightened activity or potentially an outbreak. However, as the weeks progressed, the ratio steadily decreased, falling below the baseline, which may indicate a subsiding of the illness or effective containment and response measures. The decrease was observed across all age groups, with the most significant reduction seen in patients aged 0-4 and 5-24, which are often considered key groups for the spread of influenza due to high contact rates in schools and daycare settings. This trend could lead to a reduced burden on healthcare resources, but continued surveillance is essential to monitor for possible resurgences or new strains of the virus.
