Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable upward trend in the ratio of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, increasing from an initial 0.93% to 6.68% in the most recent week, significantly above the 20-week average of 6.26%. Influenza A has demonstrated a particularly sharp rise in detection, with its positivity ratio escalating from 0.58% to 5.79%, suggesting a predominance over Influenza B, which also increased but at a steadier pace from 0.35% to 0.89%. The total number of specimens tested has grown substantially, peaking at 23,476 in the last week, which could indicate increased surveillance or heightened incidence of respiratory illness. The growing positivity rate, especially for Influenza A, could signify an ongoing or impending influenza outbreak, necessitating enhanced healthcare preparedness to manage potential increases in hospital admissions and demand for medical resources. Public health responses may need to be adjusted to address the rising influenza activity, including vaccination campaigns and public awareness initiatives to contain the spread.
