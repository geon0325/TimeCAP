Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperature experienced a gradual decline before stabilizing and then rising again, suggesting a typical diurnal pattern with cooler temperatures in the early hours. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, reaching saturation at one point, which could have led to fog or mist, especially when coupled with low temperatures, but later dropped, indicating drier conditions towards the end of the period. Air pressure remained relatively stable for most of the time but showed a sharp decrease in the final hours, hinting at a possible change in weather conditions such as the approach of a new weather system. Wind speeds varied, with some brisk periods, but overall, the wind was moderate; however, the wind direction shifted drastically a couple of times, which could result in changing weather patterns, including the potential for rapid cloud movement or the dispersion of any fog. The combination of these factors points towards a dynamic weather scenario in San Francisco, with the potential for varying cloud cover and visibility conditions.
