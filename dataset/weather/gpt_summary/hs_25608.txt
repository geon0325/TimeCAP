Over the last 24 hours, the weather in Houston has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, followed by a significant increase during the afternoon hours, indicating a typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels were high throughout the period, peaking at saturation during the early morning, which could have led to foggy conditions or dew. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable but showed a sharp increase, suggesting the possible influence of a high-pressure system moving into the area. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with some variability, and wind direction shifted markedly throughout the day, indicating changing weather patterns possibly associated with the movement of different air masses. Overall, the combination of high humidity, fluctuating temperatures, and variable winds could have resulted in dynamic weather conditions for Houston, including the potential for morning fog or mist followed by clearer skies later in the day.
