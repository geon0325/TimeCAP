Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a substantial increase in both the number of respiratory specimens tested for influenza and the number of positive cases, with the number of tests rising from 5,667 to 27,187, and the number of positive cases for both Influenza A and B increasing from a combined total of 16 to 56. Despite this increase in volume, the ratio of positive specimens has remained relatively stable, averaging 6.26%, with a peak of 0.40% in week 13 and a low of 0.13% in week 6 and 8, indicating a consistent rate of infection relative to testing. The highest positivity rate for Influenza A was 0.20% in week 15, while for Influenza B, it peaked at 0.22% in week 13. The fluctuations in the ratio of positive specimens for Influenza A and B suggest that there might be a slight variation in the prevalence of each strain over the period. The steady positivity rate, despite increased testing, suggests that influenza remains a consistent threat, and healthcare resources should continue to be allocated for testing, vaccination, and patient education to manage the impact on the healthcare system.
