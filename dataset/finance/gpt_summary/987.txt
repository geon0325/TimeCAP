Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a downward trend, declining by approximately 5.6% from 4076.57 to 3849.28, suggesting increased investor caution and a potential shift towards a risk-off sentiment. This is further evidenced by the VIX, which despite minor fluctuations, has generally remained elevated, indicating persistent market volatility and uncertainty. The Nikkei 225 has also experienced a notable decrease, dropping by around 7.5%, while the FTSE 100 has remained relatively stable with a slight upward trend, suggesting regional variations in market performance. Gold Futures have seen an upward movement, suggesting a flight to safety among investors, while Crude Oil Futures have fluctuated but ended slightly lower, which could imply concerns over global demand or potential supply adjustments. Lastly, the exchange rates show a mild depreciation of the USD against the EUR and JPY, but little change against the CNY, which may reflect currency-specific factors and shifts in trade dynamics or monetary policy expectations.
