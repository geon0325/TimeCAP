Over the past 24 hours in New York City, temperatures have shown a gradual increase, indicating a warming trend which reached its peak in the late afternoon before stabilizing. Humidity levels have varied significantly, with notable peaks in the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of more moisture in the air during these times which could lead to morning fog or dew. Air pressure has been on a steady decline, which is often associated with the approach of a low-pressure system that could result in unsettled weather conditions, potentially leading to increased cloudiness or precipitation. Wind speeds were generally moderate but showed some fluctuations, with calmer winds in the evening and stronger gusts occurring intermittently throughout the period. The prevailing wind direction was predominantly from the south to south-west, which is typically associated with warmer air being drawn into the region, possibly contributing to the observed temperature increase.
