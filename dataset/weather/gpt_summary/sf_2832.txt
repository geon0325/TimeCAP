San Francisco has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature over the past 24 hours, reaching its lowest point during the early morning hours before rising again towards the latter part of the day. Humidity levels fluctuated, with a significant spike observed, indicative of a possible weather system moving through the area. Air pressure remained relatively stable initially, but a substantial increase was noted, which could signal the arrival of a high-pressure system, potentially leading to clearer conditions. Wind speeds have generally decreased throughout the period, suggesting a calming of weather conditions. The wind direction was predominantly westerly but showed variability towards the end, which, along with the changes in pressure and humidity, could suggest a change in weather patterns.
