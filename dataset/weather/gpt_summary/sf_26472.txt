Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual decrease in temperature which later reversed into a mild warming trend, indicative of a typical diurnal variation influenced by coastal climate patterns. Humidity levels were highly variable, peaking at saturation during certain hours, which may have resulted in foggy conditions, especially common in this region. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight fluctuation mid-period, suggesting no significant weather fronts moving through the area. Wind speeds varied moderately with occasional gusts; the prevailing winds were mostly westerly, which is characteristic of the city's weather due to maritime influences. The consistency in wind direction and the lack of extreme changes in other weather indicators suggest a stable weather pattern without immediate indications of severe weather events.
