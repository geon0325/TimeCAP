Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature, with a general decreasing trend followed by a gradual increase towards the end of the period. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the day, indicating a significant amount of moisture in the air that could contribute to a feeling of mugginess and discomfort. Air pressure saw a slight but steady increase, suggesting stable atmospheric conditions that could suppress the development of significant weather systems. Wind speeds varied moderately but were mostly gentle to moderate, with a notable decrease in the middle of the period before picking back up slightly. The wind direction was predominantly from the south-southeast, shifting more towards the east later on, which could influence local weather patterns such as potential sea breeze effects or the transport of moisture inland.
