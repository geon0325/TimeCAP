Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 showed volatility with an overall slight decrease, starting at 3999.09 and ending at 4090.46, indicating a tentative market sentiment. The VIX, which is a measure of market volatility, fluctuated but ended slightly higher at 20.53 compared to its starting point of 18.35, suggesting increased investor uncertainty. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 experienced general upward trends, closing higher than their opening figures, which may signal strengthening confidence in the respective markets of Japan and the UK. Gold Futures saw a significant drop, particularly towards the latter part of the period, which often indicates that investors are shifting towards riskier assets. The exchange rates for EUR/USD and USD/CNY remained relatively stable with minor depreciation of the Euro and the Chinese Yuan against the Dollar, while the USD/JPY showed a notable increase, ending at 131.52, which could point to a strengthening US Dollar or shifting dynamics in the currency markets.
