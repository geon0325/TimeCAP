Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a gradual decrease in temperature, indicating a cooling trend as we moved from day into night. Humidity levels remained high throughout the period, which could have contributed to a muggy or damp feeling in the air. Air pressure experienced a slight but steady increase, suggesting stable weather conditions are likely to prevail or even improve. Wind speeds showed an overall increase towards the end of the period, with the direction shifting from predominantly easterly to a more northerly component, which might signal a change in weather patterns or the approach of a frontal system. This combination of rising air pressure, shifting wind direction, and increasing wind speed could lead to clearer and drier conditions in the near future.
