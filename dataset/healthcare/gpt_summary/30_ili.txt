Over the last 20 weeks, the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data shows a persistent upward trend in the ratio of ILI patients, which indicates a growing incidence of ILI across all age groups. The most substantial increase has been observed in the youngest age group (0-4 years), which may suggest higher vulnerability or increased exposure in this demographic. The consistent rise in ILI across other age groups also raises concerns about widespread transmission and potential strain on healthcare resources. Although the current ratio of ILI patients remains below the baseline for determining an influenza epidemic, the trend towards higher ratios warrants close monitoring and preparedness in the healthcare system for a possible increase in healthcare demand. The data suggests that healthcare providers should remain vigilant and possibly strengthen preventive measures and patient education to mitigate the spread of ILI.
