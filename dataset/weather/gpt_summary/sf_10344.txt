Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have experienced minor fluctuations, generally remaining within a narrow range, indicating stable weather conditions without any significant warm-up or cool-down. Humidity levels have seen some variance, with notably higher humidity during the nighttime hours, which could have resulted in foggy conditions, particularly in coastal areas. Air pressure has been gradually increasing, suggesting the strengthening of a high-pressure system which may lead to clearer skies and calmer weather in the short term. Wind speeds have mostly been light, with a sudden increase in the last recorded hour, which could bring a change in weather patterns if sustained. The wind direction has varied but has predominantly come from the west and northwest, which is typical for San Francisco's climate and may contribute to the city's cool maritime influence.
