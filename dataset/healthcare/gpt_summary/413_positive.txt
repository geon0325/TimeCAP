Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant upward trend in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the average positivity rate increasing from 0.70% to 14.91%, well above the 20-week average of 6.26%. The most substantial growth was observed in Influenza A, which saw its positivity rate rise from 0.47% to 11.38%, indicating that it is the predominant strain in the current influenza cases. Influenza B also showed an increase but at a more gradual pace, with its positivity rate climbing from 0.23% to 3.52%. The peak of positive influenza cases coincided with a dramatic rise in the ratio of positive specimens, reaching a high of 18.27% in week 16 for combined Influenza A and B, before showing a slight decrease in subsequent weeks. This trend suggests a significant influenza season and could strain healthcare resources, necessitating increased vigilance and potential scaling-up of influenza-related healthcare services, including diagnostics, treatment, vaccination efforts, and public health interventions.
