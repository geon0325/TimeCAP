Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, followed by an increase towards the afternoon, indicative of a typical diurnal pattern. Humidity levels showed an increasing trend overnight, which is common as temperatures drop, but a significant spike in humidity occurred in the late evening, suggesting the possible presence of additional moisture in the air or a localized weather event. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day with minor fluctuations, which typically suggests steady weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally light but saw a notable increase in the late evening, which, combined with the spike in humidity, could signal an approaching weather system. The wind direction varied significantly, with a major shift observed in the late evening hours, supporting the inference of changing weather patterns possibly due to an incoming front or storm system.
