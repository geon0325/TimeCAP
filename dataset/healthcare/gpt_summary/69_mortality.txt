Over the past 20 weeks, mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia has consistently remained below the average ratio of 7.84%, with the percentage fluctuating between 5.21% and 6.15%. Despite a peak in the total number of deaths at the beginning of the period (53,741), the absolute number of deaths attributed to Influenza or Pneumonia has decreased, as evidenced by the decline in pneumonia-related deaths from 3,198 to 2,761 and a decrease in influenza-related deaths from 106 to 8. The ratio of mortality from these conditions has shown a slight variation week-to-week but has not experienced a significant increase, suggesting a stable trend in the impact of these illnesses relative to other causes of death. This consistent underperformance relative to the historical average ratio could indicate effective management of these respiratory illnesses or a shift in the pattern of mortality causes. Healthcare systems may consider reallocating resources to address other emerging health threats while continuing to monitor and prevent potential outbreaks of Influenza or Pneumonia.
