Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced relatively stable temperatures with a slight warming trend noticed towards the latter part of the day. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, reaching saturation at one point, indicating the likelihood of fog or mist during that period, and dropping to lower levels which might have made conditions feel more comfortable. Air pressure has been gradually decreasing, suggesting an increased chance of changing weather patterns, possibly leading to precipitation or stormy conditions. Wind speeds have been mostly light to moderate, with no significant gusts, promoting steady but not turbulent atmospheric conditions. The wind direction has been variable, though predominantly coming from the south to southeast, which could be associated with bringing in warmer air masses.
