Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a gradual increase in the ratio of positive specimens for both Influenza A and B, with Influenza B showing a more pronounced rise. Despite fluctuations, the overall trend suggests an increasing prevalence of influenza, with a peak in the positive percentage for Influenza B at 0.21% in week 16. The highest number of specimens tested occurred in week 8 (34,907), while the number of tests has generally been rising, indicating possibly increased surveillance or greater incidence of respiratory symptoms prompting testing. Influenza A positivity rates have remained relatively low, peaking at 0.20% in week 3, but with a notable decrease to 0.03% in week 19, suggesting a possible decline in Influenza A activity. These trends suggest a need for continued monitoring and possibly increased healthcare resources to manage the higher incidence of Influenza B, which could have implications for treatment and vaccination strategies.
