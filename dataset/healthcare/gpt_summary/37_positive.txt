Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a gradual increase in both the number of respiratory specimens tested for influenza and the number of positive cases, with the total specimens tested more than doubling from 7,417 to 16,652, and the number of positive specimens for Influenza A and B increasing from 127 to 319. Consequently, the percentage of positive specimens has also risen from 1.71% to 1.92%, surpassing the average positive ratio of 6.26% for the entire period. Notably, there has been a shift with Influenza A positivity rates increasing from 0.59% to 1.21%, suggesting a relative increase in Influenza A activity compared to Influenza B, which increased from 1.12% to 0.71% in the same timeframe. This trend could indicate a potential surge in Influenza A cases that healthcare providers should prepare for. The increasing trend in positive cases, particularly for Influenza A, may indicate the need for enhanced surveillance, vaccination efforts, and resource allocation to manage the growing healthcare demands.
