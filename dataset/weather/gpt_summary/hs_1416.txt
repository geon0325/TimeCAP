Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature experienced a significant drop before rising again, suggesting a possible frontal passage through the area. Humidity levels showed a marked increase overnight, reaching a peak that coincided with the temperature drop, which is indicative of cooler and more humid air settling in. Air pressure remained relatively stable after a slight decrease, maintaining values that are typical for stable weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a slight increase observed later in the period, which could contribute to a wind chill effect given the cooler temperatures. The wind direction was predominantly from the east to southeast, shifting to a more southerly direction, which is consistent with the inflow of warmer air from the Gulf of Mexico that could contribute to the warming trend observed.
