Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual decline in temperature followed by a steady increase, suggesting a typical diurnal pattern with cooler temperatures overnight transitioning to warmer conditions by the afternoon. Humidity levels have fluctuated significantly, with periods of both high and moderate humidity, which could have contributed to variable feelings of comfort or mugginess. Air pressure showed a marked increase in the early hours, indicating the possible arrival of a high-pressure system, but this was followed by a sharp decrease, suggesting the system may have been transient or replaced by a lower pressure system thereafter. Wind speeds varied from calm to breezy conditions, with a notable increase during times of temperature rise, which may have influenced the dispersion of humidity and moderated temperatures. The wind direction was predominantly from the west and northwest, with occasional shifts, which is typical for the coastal climate of San Francisco, but the variability of direction indicates a lack of a stable weather pattern.
