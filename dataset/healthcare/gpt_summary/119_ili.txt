The time-series data for Influenza-like Illness (ILI) over the last 20 weeks illustrates a decrease in the overall number of ILI patients across all age groups, with the ratio of ILI patients remaining consistently below the baseline indicator of 2.9% for influenza activity. Despite a decline in patient numbers, there has been a slight uptick in the ratio of ILI patients in recent weeks, suggesting a possible increase in ILI prevalence. The age group 0-4 consistently shows the highest number of ILI cases, which could indicate a higher susceptibility or transmission rate within this demographic. The gradual increase in ILI patient ratio, particularly in the youngest and oldest age brackets, may necessitate heightened surveillance and preparedness measures in pediatric and geriatric healthcare services to manage potential spikes. The healthcare system should remain vigilant and may need to anticipate and plan for increased healthcare utilization if the trend of growing ILI ratios continues.
