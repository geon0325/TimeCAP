Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before showing a modest decline. Humidity levels started off relatively low but significantly increased overnight, maintaining higher values through the morning before a sharp decrease coincided with the peak temperatures of the day. Atmospheric pressure has remained remarkably stable throughout the period. The wind has been consistently light and, while its direction varied somewhat, it mostly blew from a westerly direction before a notable shift to an easterly direction in the most recent hours. This combination of rising temperatures, fluctuating humidity, and steady pressure, along with the light and variable wind, suggests a stable but slightly variable weather pattern for San Francisco.
