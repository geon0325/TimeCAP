Over the last 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have experienced a mild fluctuation, with a general downward trend during the nighttime hours and a rise toward the afternoon, common for the coastal Mediterranean climate of the region. Humidity levels have seen significant variability, with peaks coinciding with the lower temperatures in the early morning and late evening, indicative of possible morning and evening fog which is characteristic of San Francisco's weather patterns. Air pressure has remained relatively stable, with only slight variations, suggesting a period of steady weather without the immediate approach of significant weather fronts. Wind speeds have varied from light to moderate, with a notable decrease during the nighttime, which is typical due to the reduction of solar heating and the stabilization of the air near the surface. The wind direction has predominantly been from the west and northwest, with occasional shifts, which is in alignment with the city's prevailing wind patterns coming off the Pacific Ocean.
