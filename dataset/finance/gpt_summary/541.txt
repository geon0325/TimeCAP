The VIX, which measures market volatility, has fluctuated but ended higher at 21.20 compared to 28.89 at the beginning, suggesting increased market uncertainty in the reviewed period. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 indices have both shown declines, with the Nikkei experiencing a more pronounced drop, which may reflect regional economic concerns and investor risk aversion. Gold futures have remained relatively stable, with minor fluctuations, ending slightly lower at 1732.90, indicating that investors might be using gold as a safe haven amidst market instability. Meanwhile, crude oil futures experienced a significant drop from 63.53 to 61.18, which could impact inflation and economic recovery expectations, while currency exchange rates for EUR/USD and USD/JPY showed slight depreciation of the USD, and USD/CNY remained relatively stable, suggesting that forex markets have not reacted strongly to the volatility in equity and commodities markets.
