Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the latter part of the day, which is indicative of a typical diurnal pattern. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with the highest values recorded overnight and in the early morning hours, suggesting possible morning fog or dew. Air pressure has been on a gentle decline throughout this period, which could potentially indicate an approaching weather system that may affect the city's weather in the near future. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with some variability in intensity but no strong gusts, ensuring relatively stable conditions. The wind direction was predominantly southerly to southwesterly, which often brings warmer air masses to the region, consistent with the observed increase in temperatures.
