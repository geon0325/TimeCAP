Over the past 20 weeks, the data indicate a steady increase in the ratio of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) patients across all age groups, with the most significant rise observed in the youngest (0-4 years) and oldest (65 years or more) populations. This upward trend has recently surpassed the baseline threshold for ILI incidence, indicating a potential onset of an influenza outbreak. The consistent growth in ILI cases, particularly in the most vulnerable age brackets, could foreshadow a strain on healthcare resources, including increased demand for medical consultations, hospitalizations, and antiviral medications. The healthcare system may need to prepare for a surge in service utilization and consider implementing preventive measures such as vaccination campaigns and public health advisories. Given that the ratio of ILI patients has now exceeded the baseline, health authorities should closely monitor the situation for further escalation and ensure adequate response capacity.
