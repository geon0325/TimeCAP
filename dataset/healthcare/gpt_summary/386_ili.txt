Over the past 20 weeks, the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) activity has remained below the severity benchmark of 2.9%, with the highest ratio of ILI patients reaching 2.85% in the most recent week. The data reveals a gradual increase in the percentage of ILI cases, suggesting a potential upward trend as the ratio has climbed from a low of 1.52% up to the current 2.85%. The age group of 0-4 years consistently shows the highest number of ILI cases, with a noticeable increase in the last four weeks, indicating that this demographic could be the most affected during a potential outbreak. The age group of 5-24 years also demonstrates a significant rise in ILI cases, more than doubling from the beginning of the time series, which may have implications for school and community transmission. Healthcare providers should be aware of these trends to prepare for a possible increase in demand for medical services and to consider strengthening surveillance and prevention measures, especially among the youngest age groups.
