Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a marked fluctuation in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with an initial increase followed by a recent decline. The peak positivity rate was observed in week 7 at 18.27%, driven by a surge in both Influenza A and B cases, indicating a significant seasonal outbreak. Since then, the rates have gradually decreased, with the latest data showing a positivity rate of 9.17%, suggesting a downtrend in influenza cases. Notably, Influenza A has consistently been more prevalent than Influenza B, with its highest positivity rate at 14.99% compared to Influenza B's peak at 6.93%, which could indicate different patterns of transmission or vaccine effectiveness between the strains. The observed trends may impact healthcare resource allocation, with a potential reduction in the need for influenza-related healthcare services as the positivity rates decline.
