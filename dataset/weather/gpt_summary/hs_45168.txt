Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, reaching its lowest point in the early morning before rising again towards the afternoon. Humidity levels were relatively stable in the first half of the day, with a slight increase during the morning, followed by a significant drop in the afternoon, suggesting drier conditions as the day progressed. Air pressure remained fairly constant with a slight overall decrease, indicating stable weather conditions but with a possibility of changing patterns. Wind speeds were mostly light to gentle with some variability, and the predominant wind direction was from the northeast, shifting towards the east and occasionally becoming variable. The combination of these factors suggests a typical day with no extreme weather events, but the drop in humidity and slight changes in air pressure could foreshadow a shift in the weather pattern for Houston.
