Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a slight decrease in temperature, followed by a minor warming trend, and then temperatures stabilized towards the end of the period. Humidity levels remained high throughout the day, indicative of a muggy atmosphere which could lead to discomfort among residents and potential for fog formation. Air pressure showed a gradual downward trend, suggesting a possible change in weather conditions, such as increased cloudiness or the approach of a weather front. Wind speeds were consistent but started to increase slightly in the latter hours, which may help disperse humidity but also could contribute to cooler perceived temperatures. Wind direction remained predominantly from the southeast, which is typical for this region and can bring moist air from the Gulf of Mexico, sustaining the high humidity levels observed.
