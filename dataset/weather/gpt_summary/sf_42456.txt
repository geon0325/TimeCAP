Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual decline in temperature followed by a moderate increase, suggesting a typical diurnal temperature variation with cooler conditions overnight that warmed up during the day. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, with periods of complete saturation indicating possible fog or mist, especially when paired with the cooler temperatures and higher humidity during early morning hours. Air pressure remained relatively stable, suggesting a lack of strong weather systems moving through the area that would cause significant weather changes. Wind speeds varied but generally remained light to moderate, with occasional gusts; the wind direction was variable but predominantly came from the west-northwest, which is common for the region. Overall, the data points to a relatively stable weather pattern with mild conditions, but the high humidity levels during certain periods could have led to some early morning fog, which is characteristic of the San Francisco area.
