The analysis of the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data over the past 20 weeks reveals a noticeable fluctuation in the number of ILI cases across all age groups, with a significant peak in the ratio of ILI patients during the weeks where it surpassed the baseline threshold of 2.9%. In particular, there was a marked increase in ILI cases among the 5-24 age group, which could indicate higher transmission rates in settings such as schools or colleges. The data also suggests a steady rise in ILI cases among older age groups (50-64 and 65 or more), which is concerning given their potential vulnerability to complications. After reaching a peak, there appears to be a gradual decline in ILI ratios, suggesting a possible easing of the ILI activity. Healthcare systems should remain vigilant and prepared for potential surges, especially in providing support to educational institutions and protecting the older population, while continuing to monitor trends for any signs of resurgence.
