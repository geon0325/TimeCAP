The trend in respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza over the last 20 weeks shows a gradual increase in the percentage of positive cases, rising from an early low of 1.34% in week 10 to a peak of 2.58% in week 20. Notably, the positive rates for Influenza A have increased more significantly than for Influenza B, with Influenza A starting at 0.82% and reaching 1.85%, while Influenza B showed a less pronounced rise from 0.53% to 0.73% in the same period. The total number of specimens tested has also increased over time, with the initial count being 9568 specimens in week 1 and reaching 18391 by week 20, indicating heightened surveillance or possibly a higher demand for testing due to increased respiratory illness. The higher ratio of positive specimens for Influenza A compared to Influenza B suggests a predominant circulation of Influenza A strains in the population. Considering these trends, healthcare systems should be prepared for an increased burden of influenza cases and may need to adjust resource allocation for diagnostics, treatment, and vaccination efforts accordingly.
