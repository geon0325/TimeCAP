Over the past 24 hours, temperatures in San Francisco exhibited a noticeable diurnal variation, with cooler conditions prevailing in the early hours and a significant warming trend observed during the daytime, which could be attributed to the city's coastal Mediterranean climate. Humidity levels varied inversely with temperature, staying high during the cooler night and early morning hours, then dropping during the warmer afternoon, which is typical for the region as moisture capacity decreases with rising temperatures. Air pressure showed a gradual decrease through the day, indicating a potential change in weather patterns or the approach of a weather system that could alter current conditions. Wind speeds varied, with generally light winds in the early hours that intensified towards the current hour, suggesting an increase in coastal breeze activity which could affect local temperatures and fog development. The wind direction was predominantly from the west and northwest, which is characteristic of the prevailing oceanic winds influencing San Francisco's weather, potentially bringing in cooler air from the Pacific.
