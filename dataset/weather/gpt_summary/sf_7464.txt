Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, peaking during the later hours before a significant drop. Humidity levels remained high throughout the day, with a slight decrease following the temperature peak, indicating a possible relationship between temperature and atmospheric moisture content. Air pressure showed a steady but slight decline, suggesting a potential change in weather patterns or the approach of a weather system.
