Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant increase in both the number of respiratory specimens tested for influenza and the percentage that tested positive, peaking at a positivity rate of 26.27% in week 13. This surge was predominantly driven by Influenza A, which at its highest point constituted 25.70% of the positive specimens, indicating that it is the dominant strain in the current flu season. After reaching the peak, there has been a noticeable decline in positivity rates, with week 20 showing a reduction to 2.12% overall positivity, and a decline to 1.95% for Influenza A. Influenza B has remained a minor contributor throughout the period, with a relatively stable positivity rate that slightly increased toward the end of the period, accounting for 0.17% in week 20. The observed trends suggest a tapering off of the flu season, but continuous monitoring is essential to manage and allocate healthcare resources efficiently.
