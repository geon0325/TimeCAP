Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature, showing a cooling trend towards the current hour after experiencing some warmer peaks. The humidity levels have been highly variable, reaching saturation at various points, which could indicate the presence of fog or mist, especially during cooler temperatures. Air pressure saw a significant rise in the middle of the period, suggesting the possible passage of a frontal system, which could have contributed to changes in weather conditions. Wind speeds have been generally light to moderate with some increase noted recently, which might influence the dispersal of humidity and could result in clearer skies if the trend persists. The wind direction has been predominantly from the easterly to southerly directions, with a brief shift to a westerly direction, which could have brought different air masses into the region, affecting both temperature and humidity.
