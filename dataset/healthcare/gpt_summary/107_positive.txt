Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable increase in the proportion of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the ratio of positive specimens peaking at 27.37% in week 14, followed by a consistent decline to 15.69% by week 20. Influenza A has been the predominant strain throughout the period, reaching a maximum positivity rate of 22.19% in week 11, but this has since decreased to 7.07% in the latest week. Conversely, the positivity rate for Influenza B showed a slower rise but continued to increase until week 18, suggesting a later seasonal peak compared to Influenza A, with a peak rate of 10.95%, before declining to 8.62%. The highest number of specimens tested occurred in week 14 (80,322), coinciding with the peak positive rate, indicating a possible response to increasing influenza cases. The observed trends suggest a significant burden on healthcare resources during the peak weeks, with a recent decrease indicating a possible easing of the influenza season's impact.
