Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has experienced significant volatility with a marked downward trend, dropping from 4391.69 to 4023.89, suggesting investor uncertainty and potential bearish sentiment in the market. The VIX, commonly known as the Fear Index, has seen heightened levels, peaking at 34.75, which aligns with increased market volatility and investor apprehension. International indices have mirrored this instability, with Japan's Nikkei 225 and the UK's FTSE 100 showing fluctuations, although the Nikkei ended on a positive note from the starting point, indicating some resilience in Asian markets. Commodity prices such as Gold Futures and Crude Oil Futures have also been subject to volatility, with gold seeing a downward trend indicative of a reduced appeal for safe-haven assets, whereas crude oil prices increased, potentially signaling future inflationary pressures. Exchange rates have seen the Euro and Yen depreciate against the US Dollar, while the Chinese Yuan has shown a more pronounced depreciation, which could impact global trade dynamics and currency markets.
