Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has displayed a general uptrend, closing higher by approximately 11% from 3790.38 to 4210.24, indicating a positive momentum in the U.S. equity market. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, has shown a decreasing trend, moving from 26.40 to 19.74, which suggests that investors' fear and uncertainty have diminished during this period. International markets have seen mixed movements; the Nikkei 225 experienced a slight increase, indicative of steady, albeit cautious optimism in the Japanese market, while the FTSE 100 demonstrated a more pronounced upward trend, reflecting stronger investor confidence in the UK. Gold Futures have risen modestly, suggesting an underlying sense of caution among investors, as gold is often seen as a safe-haven asset. Exchange rates have shown stability with minor fluctuations against the USD, indicating a period of relative calm in currency markets, particularly with the EUR/USD and USD/CNY pairs remaining mostly unchanged, while the USD/JPY experienced a more noticeable dip followed by recovery, ending slightly lower, which may reflect shifts in risk appetite and interest rate differentials between the U.S. and Japan.
