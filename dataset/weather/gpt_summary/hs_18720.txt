Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the weather has shown a mild fluctuation in temperature, maintaining a relatively stable warmth throughout the period. Humidity levels were consistently high, suggesting a considerable amount of moisture in the air, which could lead to a feeling of mugginess and could potentially result in fog or dew if temperatures were to drop. Air pressure remained notably steady, indicating stable weather conditions without significant fronts or storms moving through the area. Wind speeds were moderate, with no significant gusts, implying a gentle to moderate breeze that would not likely cause any weather-related disruptions. The wind direction was predominantly from the south to southeast, which is typical for Houston and may contribute to the area's humidity by drawing in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico.
