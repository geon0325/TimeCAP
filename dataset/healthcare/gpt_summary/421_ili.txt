Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a gradual decline in the percentage of influenza-like illness (ILI) cases among all patient visits, starting above the 2.9% benchmark but falling consistently to a low of 1.57% in the most recent week. The highest proportion of ILI cases was observed in patients aged 5-24, which also experienced a decreasing trend in the number of reported ILI cases. Notably, all age groups followed a similar downward trend, suggesting a widespread decrease in ILI activity across the population. However, the percentage of ILI cases remained highest in the youngest (0-4 years) and lowest in the oldest age group (65 years or more), indicating age-related differences in ILI occurrence. Given that ILI rates have dropped below the 2.9% severity benchmark, the healthcare system may currently experience less strain from influenza cases, but continued monitoring is essential to detect any potential resurgence.
