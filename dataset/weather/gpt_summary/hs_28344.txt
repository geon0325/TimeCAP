Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced relatively stable temperatures with a slight cooling trend observed in the most recent readings. Humidity levels have remained high, with a peak coinciding with the lowest temperatures, indicating potential morning fog or dew. The air pressure showed a decreasing trend over the period, which could be associated with the development of unsettled weather conditions or an approaching weather system. Wind speeds varied, with a significant increase at one point, which may have contributed to cooler temperatures and could indicate the presence of a frontal system. Notably, there was a sharp change in wind direction toward the later hours, shifting from southeasterly to northwesterly, which often signifies the passage of a front and could lead to clearer conditions following any precipitation.
