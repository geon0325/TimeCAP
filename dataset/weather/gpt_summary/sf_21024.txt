Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a slight fluctuation in temperature with a trend towards cooling, before warming up again towards the current hour. Humidity levels were relatively high and even reached saturation at times, suggesting the potential for fog or drizzle, especially during the cooler early hours when the temperature dropped. Atmospheric pressure remained notably high throughout the period, indicating stable weather conditions, but there was a slight decrease in pressure towards the end of the 24-hour period, which could signal a gradual change in the weather pattern. Wind speeds were consistently light, implying a calm weather pattern with limited wind chill impact. The wind direction shifted throughout the day, primarily coming from the west and transitioning through south, which is typical for coastal San Francisco and could influence fog dispersion along the bay.
