Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable increase in the incidence of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) across all age groups, with the most significant rise observed in the youngest (0-4 years) and school-aged (5-24 years) populations. The percentage of ILI cases relative to total patient count has steadily grown from 1.32% to 3.32%, surpassing the 2.9% severity benchmark in the most recent week reported. This trend suggests a growing burden on the healthcare system, particularly in pediatric services and primary care. The escalation in ILI activity, especially reaching and exceeding the threshold in the latter weeks, indicates a potential influx of patients requiring medical attention and resources. Public health agencies and healthcare providers should be alerted to prepare for increased demand for healthcare services, possible vaccine campaigns, and preventative measures to minimize the impact on vulnerable populations and healthcare infrastructure.
