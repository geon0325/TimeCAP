Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature followed by a slight decrease towards the current hour, indicating a typical diurnal cycle transitioning from cooler night to warmer day and back. Humidity levels varied significantly, with particularly high levels during the early hours which, together with stable high air pressure, may have led to foggy or misty conditions. However, as the day progressed, humidity dropped notably, suggesting clearer conditions. Wind speeds remained relatively light throughout, with some increase during daylight hours, which could have contributed to dispersing any early humidity and aiding in the slight drop in temperature observed in the recent hours. The wind direction has shifted over the day, starting from easterly directions, gradually turning southerly, and ending in a westerly direction, which is indicative of a changing weather pattern that may affect upcoming conditions in Houston.
