Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature exhibited a typical diurnal pattern, with the lowest values occurring in the early morning hours and a gradual increase to a peak in the late afternoon, indicating a normal fluctuation without any extreme changes. Humidity levels varied significantly, starting relatively low, increasing during the night, and then decreasing slightly as the day progressed, which is consistent with the observed temperature changes and suggests a stable air mass over the region. Air pressure showed a slight declining trend throughout the period, which could be indicative of a slowly approaching weather system that may affect local conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a slight increase during the afternoon hours, and the wind direction was variable, mainly shifting from northerly to easterly and southerly directions, suggesting a change in the local weather pattern. Overall, the weather in Houston has been stable, but the decrease in air pressure and shift in wind direction could signal a change in the coming days.
