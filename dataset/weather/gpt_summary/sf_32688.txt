Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have exhibited a typical diurnal pattern with a peak during the afternoon hours and a gradual decrease overnight and into the early morning. Humidity levels have shown significant variation, with notably high humidity occurring towards the end of the period, which could be indicative of fog or mist formation, particularly common in this coastal city. Air pressure has remained relatively stable with a slight fluctuation, suggesting steady weather conditions without the immediate approach of a significant weather front. Wind speeds have been moderate with occasional increases, and wind directions have shifted, pointing to changing weather patterns such as the passage of a weak weather system or local sea breezes. The combination of high humidity, stable pressure, and variable winds could lead to the development of coastal fog, affecting visibility and potentially impacting transportation in the region.
