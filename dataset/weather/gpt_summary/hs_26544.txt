Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a notable increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before gradually cooling down. Humidity levels were initially high, consistent with nighttime and early morning conditions, but they significantly dropped as temperatures rose, indicating a possible increase in discomfort due to the heat. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increasing trend, suggesting stable weather conditions. Wind speed varied modestly throughout the period with occasional gusts, and the wind direction shifted considerably, starting from a southerly direction, turning to the west, and then predominantly coming from the north, which may have contributed to the changes in temperature and humidity. These combined factors point to a typical warm, possibly dry day in Houston with no immediate signs of precipitation or severe weather events.
