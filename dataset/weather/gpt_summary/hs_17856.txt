Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature experienced a noticeable fluctuation, with a general upward trend leading to particularly warm conditions by the end of the period. Humidity levels showed a variable pattern, peaking during the cooler early morning hours and decreasing significantly as temperatures rose, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Air pressure remained relatively steady but began a slight decline, which could signal a change in the weather pattern, such as the approach of a frontal system. Wind speeds were mostly light and constant throughout the day, providing little relief from the heat, while the wind direction gradually shifted from predominantly westerly to southerly, potentially bringing in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. Overall, the combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, and subtle changes in air pressure and wind direction could suggest a transition to hotter and potentially more unstable weather conditions in the near future.
