Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a slight decrease in temperatures, indicating a cool trend. Humidity levels have fluctuated significantly, with periods of complete saturation, suggesting a possibility of fog or mist, particularly when the humidity reached its peak at the same time as a drop in temperature. Air pressure has been on a general incline, which is typically associated with the arrival of more stable weather conditions.
