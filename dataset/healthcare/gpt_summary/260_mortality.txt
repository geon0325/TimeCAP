Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable decline in the proportion of deaths attributed to influenza or pneumonia, with the ratio of mortality from these causes to total deaths starting at 18.51% and ending at 6.02%. Despite fluctuations, the trend shows a general decrease in the mortality ratio, with a peak in the earlier weeks. The total number of deaths had a slight decrease mid-period but has shown variations with no clear downward trend towards the end of the 20-week period. The number of deaths from influenza has remained relatively low compared to pneumonia but experienced a sizeable increase in the second week before stabilizing. The consistent decrease in pneumonia-related mortality is a positive indicator; however, the healthcare system must remain vigilant due to the variable nature of influenza and pneumonia and the potential impact on healthcare resources.
