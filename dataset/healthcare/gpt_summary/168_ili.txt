Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a consistent decline in the number of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases across all age groups, with the highest count recorded in the earliest week and a gradual decrease thereafter. The ratio of ILI patients has remained below the baseline of 2.9% throughout the period, with a marked downward trend that only recently shows signs of leveling off. The age group 0-4 consistently had the highest number of ILI cases, which could suggest a higher transmission rate or susceptibility within this demographic. Despite this, the overall decline in ILI cases suggests that the healthcare system may currently be experiencing a reprieve from the pressures associated with high influenza activity. However, continued monitoring is necessary as even minor increases in the ratio of ILI patients might indicate a resurgence that could quickly impact healthcare resource allocation.
