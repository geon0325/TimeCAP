Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced relatively stable temperatures with a slight warming trend observed during the latter part of the period. Humidity levels were initially moderate but increased significantly overnight, indicating a potential for heavier, more oppressive air and possibly a higher chance of precipitation. Air pressure remained fairly constant with a slight increase towards the middle of the time frame, suggesting stable weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally low to moderate, with a slight decrease during the night, which might have contributed to the increase in humidity due to less air circulation. Wind direction was predominantly from the southeast, with a brief shift to northeasterly winds, potentially bringing in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico.
