Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable decline in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the ratio of positive specimens dropping from a peak of 9.89% in week 3 to just 0.48% in week 20. Influenza A has been the predominant strain throughout the period, but its incidence has also sharply decreased, from 9.85% in week 3 to 0.43% in week 20. The presence of Influenza B remained significantly lower than Influenza A and has shown a relatively stable but minimal positivity ratio, ranging from 0.17% at its peak to 0.05% in the latest week. This downward trend suggests a reduction in influenza activity, which could alleviate some pressure on healthcare resources, particularly in areas such as hospital admissions and the need for diagnostic testing. However, continued surveillance is essential to monitor for potential changes in influenza patterns, especially considering the potential for seasonal variations or the emergence of new strains.
