Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures exhibited a typical diurnal pattern with a peak during the daytime and a gradual decrease overnight. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, reaching their highest in the early morning hours, which could have led to a feeling of mugginess, especially when temperatures were also high. Air pressure variations were modest, with a slight increase towards the end of the period, possibly indicating a weak high-pressure system moving into the area. Wind speeds were generally light to calm, with some variability in direction, suggesting a lack of any dominant weather fronts influencing the region. The wind directions shifted throughout the day, but there was a tendency toward southerly winds, which in Houston often contribute to increased moisture and warmth.
