Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a fluctuating but overall declining trend in the ratio of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a peak of 1.37% in week one, gradually decreasing to 0.95% in week 20. Influenza A has consistently been more prevalent than Influenza B, but both subtypes show a decrease in detection rates over the period, with Influenza A decreasing from 1.10% to 0.58%, and Influenza B from 0.27% to 0.37% in the final week. Notably, Influenza B exhibited a mid-period spike, reaching as high as 0.78% positivity, which surpassed Influenza A during that phase. The overall average positivity rate of 6.26% suggests that the figures from the last 20 weeks are significantly below the average, indicating a possible seasonal decline or effective control measures. These trends are critical for healthcare resource allocation, suggesting a current lower burden of influenza but also highlighting the need for continued surveillance for potential spikes or shifts in viral subtype predominance.
