Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a gradual increase in the ratio of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) patients across all age groups, with the ratio surpassing the baseline of 2.9% in recent weeks. The number of ILI patients in the youngest age group (0-4 years) showed a significant upward trend, suggesting a higher susceptibility or reporting rate in this demographic. Although there was variability, the older age groups (50-64 years and 65 or more years) exhibited a less pronounced increase in ILI cases, which could be attributed to higher vaccination rates or less exposure to the virus. Despite fluctuations, the overall number of patients presenting with ILI symptoms has remained relatively steady, yet the proportion of those patients has increased. This trend points to a growing impact on healthcare resources, emphasizing the need for continued monitoring and possibly increased prevention efforts such as vaccination campaigns and public health education.
