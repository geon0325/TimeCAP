Over the last 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature followed by a slight decrease towards the current hour, suggesting a typical diurnal temperature cycle. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuation, with a notable decrease in the latter part of the period, which could lead to a perception of drier conditions. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable and high, indicating steady weather conditions, but a gradual decrease was observed, which might suggest an approaching weather system. Wind speeds varied, with a period of increased intensity, which could have contributed to wind chill earlier in the day, before stabilizing at moderate speeds. Additionally, there was a shift in wind direction, primarily between southerly and easterly directions, which could influence local temperature and humidity as different air masses move into the area.
