Over the last 20 weeks, the data shows a marked decrease in the proportion of deaths attributed to influenza or pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, starting from a high of 19.40% in week 4 down to 8.12% in week 20. This trend suggests a significant decline in mortality from these conditions as a share of overall deaths, dipping below the 20-week average of 7.84%. The absolute number of deaths from pneumonia has also fallen from a peak of 16,884 in week 4 to 4,771 in week 20, indicating a substantial reduction in pneumonia-related mortality over the period. However, the mortality ratio from influenza or pneumonia consistently exceeded the average ratio during the first 10 weeks, likely indicating a seasonal impact or a potential outbreak that has since been brought under control. This downward trend in mortality could alleviate some pressure on healthcare resources, but continued surveillance is necessary to maintain control over these respiratory conditions and manage healthcare system demands.
