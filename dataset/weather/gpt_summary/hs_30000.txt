Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures demonstrated a typical diurnal pattern, peaking during the afternoon hours and reaching a minimum in the early morning. Humidity levels fluctuated considerably, with very high values recorded during nighttime and early morning, suggesting the possibility of fog or dew formation, and lower values during the day, which would have likely contributed to more comfortable conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with a slight increase observed which could indicate stable weather conditions persisting. Wind speeds were generally light, with minimal variation, pointing to a calm wind regime. The wind direction showed a gradual shift from predominantly south-easterly to easterly and then to southeasterly, which could have implications for local weather patterns, such as moisture transport and cloud cover.
