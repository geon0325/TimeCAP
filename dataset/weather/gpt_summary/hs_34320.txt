Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, peaking during the afternoon hours, which is typical for the region's climate. Concurrently, humidity levels showed considerable fluctuation, with very high percentages during the early morning hours, indicative of possible morning fog or mist, and lower values as the temperature rose, suggesting drier conditions by afternoon. Air pressure remained fairly stable, with a noticeable spike followed by a sharp decrease, which could be associated with the passage of a transient weather system. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a slight increase in the afternoon that could have contributed to the dispersal of humidity. The wind direction varied, primarily coming from the north and veering to the east, which is not unusual for Houston and could have influenced the movement of moisture and air temperature across the area.
