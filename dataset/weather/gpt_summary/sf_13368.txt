Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual warming trend during the day with the temperature peaking in the late afternoon before cooling again toward the evening. Humidity levels showed minor fluctuations but remained high throughout the day, indicating a moist air mass over the area. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase toward the middle of the day, which could suggest a transient high-pressure system affecting the region. Wind speeds were generally light with some variability, including a period of calm winds, and the direction shifted significantly throughout the day, ranging from northeasterly to westerly, indicative of changing weather patterns. A notable drop in air pressure toward the end of the period could be indicative of an approaching weather system that might alter current conditions.
