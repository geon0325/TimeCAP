Over the last 24 hours in Houston, the weather has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching a peak in the late afternoon before stabilizing towards the evening. Humidity levels showed a notable decrease throughout the day, starting relatively high in the early hours but dropping significantly as temperatures rose, a typical pattern for diurnal variation in a humid subtropical climate. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight decreasing trend, which could indicate the potential for changing weather patterns or the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds were mostly light and variable, with a significant shift in direction from southeasterly to variable directions, including a period of calm. The combination of these factors suggests a stable weather pattern with no immediate indication of severe weather, although the slight pressure drop may need to be monitored for any potential changes.
