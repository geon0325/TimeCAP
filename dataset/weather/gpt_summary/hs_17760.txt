Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has experienced a slight fluctuation, showing a mild cooling trend at first before warming up later in the day. The humidity levels have remained consistently high for most of the period but have shown a modest decreasing trend in the last few hours. Air pressure has been gradually decreasing, which could indicate an approaching weather system that may lead to changes in weather conditions. The wind speeds have been relatively light and variable, with some shifts in wind direction suggesting that there isn't a dominant weather pattern currently in place. Overall, the high humidity, coupled with a slight decrease in pressure, might lead to potential cloud formation and possibly precipitation if these trends continue.
