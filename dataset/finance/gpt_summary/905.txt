Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has experienced volatility with an overall downward trend, closing lower at 3966.85 from an opening of 4145.19, suggestive of investor caution and potential concerns about market stability. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, has seen an uptick, moving from 21.15 to 25.56, which aligns with the increased uncertainty signaled by the S&P 500's movements. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have mirrored this trend, with the Nikkei dropping from 28175.87 to 27661.47 and the FTSE declining significantly from 7439.70 to 7148.50, indicating a broader sense of market unease. Commodity prices have also reflected this sentiment, with Gold Futures retreating from 1772.90 to 1696.60, and Crude Oil Futures falling from 89.01 to 86.61, which may suggest a flight to safety and concerns over global economic growth. Exchange rates have remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations; however, the USD has strengthened against both the JPY and the CNY, indicating a possible shift towards the dollar as a safe-haven currency during this period of market flux.
