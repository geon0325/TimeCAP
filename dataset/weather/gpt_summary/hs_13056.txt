Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have shown a diurnal pattern with a noticeable warm-up during the day followed by a gradual cooling towards the evening and night. Relative humidity levels have fluctuated, with a general increase during the cooler night hours, which is typical due to the inverse relationship between temperature and humidity.
