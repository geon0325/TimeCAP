Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have experienced a noticeable fluctuation with a gradual increase during the day followed by a decrease at night, consistent with diurnal patterns. Humidity levels remained high throughout much of the period, peaking at full saturation, which could have led to fog formation or a feeling of mugginess, before a significant drop, indicating the possibility of clearer conditions. Air pressure exhibited some variability, with a few sharp declines, possibly suggesting the transient influence of weather fronts or local atmospheric disturbances. Wind speeds varied, generally staying within a mild to moderate range, and displayed an increase towards the current hour, which may affect outdoor activities and conditions at sea. Wind directions have been predominantly from the south and west, with a notable shift to northerly and easterly directions at times, potentially influencing the movement of marine air and coastal weather patterns.
