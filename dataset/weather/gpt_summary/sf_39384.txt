Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a noticeable drop in temperature early in the period, followed by a gradual warming trend that peaked toward the end of the observed timeframe. Humidity levels varied significantly, starting at saturation but then decreasing markedly, indicating a transition from potentially foggy or overcast conditions to clearer skies, before a late increase suggested a return of higher moisture levels. Air pressure showed a general increasing trend over the day, which typically suggests more stable weather conditions are settling in. Wind speeds were moderately variable, with periods of calmer winds followed by occasional gusts, while wind direction shifted substantially, indicating changing weather patterns that included a notable shift from southerly to northerly winds and then circling back towards easterly directions by the end of the period. These combined factors of temperature, humidity, pressure, and wind suggest that San Francisco's weather has been dynamic, with a mix of cooler and warmer conditions, varying moisture, and shifting wind patterns that could affect fog presence, cloud cover, and overall weather stability.
