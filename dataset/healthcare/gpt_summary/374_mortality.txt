Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable trend of decreasing total mortality, reaching a low in week 8, followed by a subsequent rise. Despite a general reduction in deaths specifically from influenza and pneumonia during the initial weeks, there has been a concerning uptick in recent weeks, with the number of influenza-related deaths more than doubling from week 9 to week 20. The ratio of mortality from influenza or pneumonia to total deaths started below the 20-week average of 7.84%, reaching its lowest at 5.70% in week 8, but it has since increased, surpassing the average in the last three weeks, with the latest figure standing at 7.41%. This recent increase in the ratio suggests a potential resurgence or seasonal pattern in influenza or pneumonia-related mortality. The data indicates a need for heightened vigilance and preparedness in the healthcare system to respond to the rising impact of respiratory illnesses on overall mortality.
