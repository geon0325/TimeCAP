The Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data over the last 20 weeks show a fluctuating trend with periods of significant increase, particularly in the age groups 0-4 and 5-24, which may indicate higher transmission rates among younger populations. The overall ratio of ILI patients has consistently remained above the baseline of 2.9%, suggesting a sustained presence of influenza in the population. The most substantial ILI percentage increases coincide with the age demographic of 25-49, indicating that working-age adults have been notably affected, which could have implications for workforce health and productivity. In recent weeks, there has been a notable decline in ILI percentages across all age groups, yet they remain above the baseline, indicating that while the situation may be improving, influenza is still circulating at higher than expected levels. This trend requires continued monitoring and may necessitate sustained healthcare resource allocation to manage ILI cases effectively, including vaccination efforts and public health messaging to curtail the spread.
