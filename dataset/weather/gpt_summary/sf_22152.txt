Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperature experienced a gradual decline during the night, reaching its lowest point at dawn, before rising again in the morning. Relative humidity levels were high, even hitting saturation at some points during the early hours, which could have led to foggy conditions, especially when coupled with the cooling temperatures. Air pressure remained relatively stable and high, indicating a likelihood of continued fair weather. Wind speeds were mostly light but picked up towards the end of the period, which could help to disperse any early fog or low-lying cloud cover. The wind direction was predominantly westerly, which is typical for the region and suggests a marine influence on the local climate.
