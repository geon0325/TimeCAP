Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable increase in the proportion of deaths due to Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, starting at 6.04% and rising steeply to 15.78% by the end of the period. This trend is markedly above the average ratio of 7.84%, suggesting a significant escalation in the severity or incidence of these respiratory conditions. The most substantial jump occurred in the last three weeks of the dataset, where the ratio increased from 8.63% to 15.78%, alongside a sharp rise in the absolute number of deaths attributed to Influenza or Pneumonia. The increase in pneumonia-related deaths (from 3287 to 11988) is particularly pronounced and may point to a concurrent outbreak or a strain on the healthcare system's ability to manage such cases. This data indicates a critical need for healthcare resources and interventions focused on combating Influenza and Pneumonia to mitigate further mortality.
