Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with a notable dip and recovery pattern, initially declining and then fluctuating around the 2900 mark, suggesting investor uncertainty in the equity market. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, has generally trended downwards from highs of 24.59 to the 18-19 range, indicating a slight reduction in investor anxiety. Meanwhile, the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 have experienced similar fluctuations, with the Nikkei showing a slight upward trend towards the end of the period and the FTSE recovering from a mid-period dip to close slightly higher. Gold futures have seen an uptick, peaking at 1541.00, which could be attributed to investors seeking safe-haven assets amidst market fluctuations. Exchange rates have been relatively stable with minor fluctuations in the EUR/USD and USD/JPY pairs, while the USD/CNY pair has seen a slight increase, potentially reflecting ongoing trade tensions and their effects on currency markets.
