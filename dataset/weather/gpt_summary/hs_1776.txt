Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a gradual increase in temperature, indicating a warming trend that could contribute to more comfortable conditions for residents during the day. However, the humidity levels have also risen, reaching a peak in the latter hours, which may cause the atmosphere to feel muggier and potentially less comfortable. Air pressure has shown a slight decreasing trend, which could suggest an approaching weather system that may bring changes such as increased cloudiness or precipitation. Wind speeds have been relatively mild but picked up during the afternoon, likely providing some relief from the humidity. The wind direction has been variable, predominantly coming from the east to southeast, which is typical for the region and could be associated with bringing in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico.
