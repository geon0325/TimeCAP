Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a declining trend, dropping from a high of 3580.84 to 3319.47, indicating a potential shift in investor sentiment towards risk aversion. This is further supported by the Volatility Index (VIX), which despite some fluctuation, has remained elevated, peaking at 33.60, and ending the period slightly higher than it started, suggesting ongoing market uncertainty. International indices like the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have also experienced volatility, with the Nikkei showing some resilience by ending close to where it started, while the FTSE 100 declined. Gold Futures have remained relatively stable, suggesting it continues to be seen as a safe-haven asset, ending slightly higher at 1952.10 compared to the starting point. The foreign exchange markets have seen a slight depreciation of the USD against major currencies, with the EUR/USD and USD/CNY exchange rates showing a stronger Euro and Chinese Yuan over the period, which could indicate a shift in currency market dynamics with potential implications for international trade and investment flows.
