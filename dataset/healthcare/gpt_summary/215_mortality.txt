Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a downward trend in the ratio of mortality due to influenza or pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, starting at 11.32% and ending at 6.23%, with a notable decrease from the average ratio of 7.84%. The total number of deaths has fluctuated but shows a slight decrease over time, beginning with 66,619 deaths and ending with 57,051. The number of deaths attributed to pneumonia has consistently decreased from 7,520 to 3,554, while deaths from influenza have remained relatively low and variable, with a peak at 26 deaths and a final count of 3. This descending trend in the pneumonia mortality ratio may suggest improvements in healthcare interventions, public health measures, or seasonal variations. However, the persistent presence of these respiratory conditions highlights the need for continued vigilance and resources in healthcare systems to manage and prevent such infectious diseases.
