Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has experienced significant volatility, with an initial sharp decline followed by partial recovery, closing at 2626.65 from a starting point of 3003.37. The VIX, or Volatility Index, has mirrored this instability, spiking as high as 82.69, indicating heightened market fear, before retracting to 57.08, suggesting that while investor anxiety has eased, it remains elevated compared to historical averages. Global stock markets have also reflected this turbulence, with Japan's Nikkei 225 and the UK's FTSE 100 both showing pronounced drops and partial rebounds, ending at 19084.97 and 5563.70 respectively. Gold futures have fluctuated but remained relatively stable, highlighting its status as a safe-haven asset, whereas crude oil futures have plummeted to 20.09 from 47.18, pressured by both the demand shock from COVID-19 and an oversupply due to the Saudi-Russian price war. Exchange rates have seen the USD depreciate against the JPY and the EUR, but appreciate against the CNY, suggesting a complex interplay of currency safe-haven seeking and trade dynamics amidst global economic uncertainty.
