Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature, with a general trend of cooling during the early hours that transitioned into a gradual warming. Humidity levels have varied, reaching saturation during certain periods, potentially leading to the formation of fog, especially when coupled with the lower temperatures observed. Air pressure remained relatively stable for most of the day but saw a noticeable decrease in the later hours, which could indicate an approaching weather system or front. Wind speeds were consistently light to gentle, with no significant gusts, maintaining calm conditions throughout the day. Wind direction shifted predominantly from the west to southwest, which is typical for the coastal climate of San Francisco and may have contributed to the maritime influx of humidity.
