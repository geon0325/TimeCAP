Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a consistent increase in the number of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the total ratio of positive specimens rising from 1.11% to 2.73%. This upward trend is primarily driven by a significant rise in Influenza A detections, which have grown from 0.74% to 2.32%, while Influenza B has shown a more modest increase from 0.38% to 0.42%. The highest weekly increase in positive specimens occurred in the most recent week, with a jump from 2.17% to 2.73%. The increase in positive influenza cases is occurring alongside an increase in testing volume, with the number of specimens tested escalating from 7,723 to 23,563 over the 20-week period. The growing rate of influenza infections, particularly Influenza A, could indicate the beginning of an influenza wave, necessitating preparedness in healthcare settings for a potential influx of patients requiring medical attention.
