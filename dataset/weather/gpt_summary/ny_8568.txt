Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature followed by a slight decline, indicating a typical diurnal variation with warmer conditions during the day transitioning to cooler temperatures at night. Humidity levels were saturated during the early hours but showed a significant decrease towards the afternoon, suggesting a possible clearing of skies or a change in air mass. Air pressure varied, with notable fluctuations that might have led to changes in weather patterns, including the possibility of wind shifts or the passage of a frontal system. Wind speeds remained relatively light throughout, with minor variability, which would have had a limited impact on dispersing pollutants and might lead to a feeling of stagnation in the air. The wind direction shifted predominantly from northwesterly to northerly and then varied more broadly, suggesting the influence of passing weather systems over the city.
