The VIX, also known as the Fear Index, has fluctuated but generally increased from 13.86 to 17.13, which is consistent with the observed market volatility and investor anxiety. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 have experienced volatility, with the Nikkei showing a notable drop, particularly in recent days, while the FTSE 100 has seen a more gradual decline, ending at 7257.80 from a starting point of 7691.80.

Currency markets have shown the USD strengthening against major currencies like the EUR and JPY, while remaining relatively steady against the CNY, which could impact international trade dynamics and export competitiveness.
