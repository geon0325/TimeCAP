Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature reaching its peak in the late afternoon before starting to decrease slightly towards the evening. Humidity levels were high throughout the day, reaching saturation at several points, which is indicative of a very moist air mass over the region and may have contributed to a feeling of mugginess or even the potential for fog formation, especially during the early hours when temperatures were cooler. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase towards the midday, suggesting stable weather conditions without significant fronts or weather systems moving through the area. Wind speeds varied, with a period of calmer conditions around sunrise and an increase later in the day, which could have helped to alleviate some of the humidity and potentially disperse any fog or low clouds. Wind direction was predominantly from the southeast to south, consistent with Houston's typical weather patterns, which often bring moisture from the Gulf of Mexico inland.
