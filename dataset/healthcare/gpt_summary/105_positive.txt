Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant increase in the positivity rate of influenza specimens, rising from 2.09% to a peak of 27.37% before slightly decreasing to 22.62% in the most recent data. Influenza A has consistently been the dominant subtype, with its positivity rate growing from 1.50% to a high of 22.19% and then reducing to 11.95%, though it still represents a substantial proportion of positive cases. Influenza B, while less prevalent than Influenza A, also showed a marked increase in its positivity rate, from 0.59% to 10.66%, indicating a significant presence in the tested specimens. The number of specimens tested has generally increased over time, reaching a peak at week 16, which may reflect a response to the growing number of cases. The observed trends suggest a heightened influenza activity during the period, potentially placing increased demand on healthcare resources, necessitating preparedness in managing cases, vaccination efforts, and public health interventions.
