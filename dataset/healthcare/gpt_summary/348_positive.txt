Over the last 20 weeks, the data shows an upward trend in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a notable increase in recent weeks, peaking at 5.44% in the latest week, which is significantly above the 20-week average of 6.26%. The majority of positive cases are attributed to Influenza A, which has seen a sharp rise from 0.43% to 5.32% of specimens tested. In contrast, Influenza B has remained relatively stable and low, with a slight increase from 0.05% to 0.11% of specimens tested. This rising trend in Influenza A cases suggests an ongoing or approaching influenza season, which could lead to increased hospital admissions and a potential strain on healthcare resources. Public health initiatives may need to focus on influenza prevention and control measures, including vaccination and public education on hygiene practices, to mitigate the impact.
