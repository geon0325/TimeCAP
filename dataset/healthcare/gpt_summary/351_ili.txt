The time-series data for Influenza-like Illness (ILI) over the last 20 weeks indicates a notable increase in the ratio of ILI patients, surpassing the baseline of 2.9% during the middle of the observed period, reflecting a peak in ILI activity. This increase is particularly pronounced in the age groups 25-49 and 5-24, suggesting that these populations were significantly affected during the peak weeks. Following this peak, there was a decline in ILI patient ratios across all age groups, with the trend returning to below baseline levels, indicating a potential easing of the ILI situation. However, healthcare systems should remain vigilant as the ILI rates for younger age groups (0-4 and 5-24) consistently show higher counts compared to the other age groups, hinting at a sustained vulnerability in these populations. The data suggests a seasonal pattern with a rise and fall in ILI incidence, which could guide healthcare preparedness and resource allocation for potential future surges.
