Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak at the end of the observed period, suggesting a warming trend. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with a noticeable drop in the late afternoon, which could have implications for comfort levels and the possibility of heat-related stress. Air pressure was relatively stable with only minor fluctuations, indicating no significant weather fronts moving through the area during the observed timeframe. Wind speeds increased toward the end of the period, which could contribute to cooler perceived temperatures and help disperse atmospheric pollutants. The wind direction was variable throughout the day but predominantly came from a southerly direction in the latter half, which in Houston is often associated with warmer air being drawn up from the Gulf of Mexico.
