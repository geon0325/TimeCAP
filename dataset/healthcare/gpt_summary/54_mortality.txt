Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable decrease in both the total number of deaths and deaths attributed to influenza and pneumonia, with the total number of deaths dropping from 64,646 to 51,045 and deaths from influenza and pneumonia declining from 7,038 to 2,931 combined. The proportion of deaths from influenza and pneumonia to total deaths began at 10.89% and ended at 5.74%, showing a downward trend and falling below the 20-week average of 7.84%. The largest week-to-week decrease in the influenza and pneumonia mortality ratio occurred between the first and last week, with a drop of 5.15 percentage points. Notably, deaths from influenza saw a substantial reduction, from 1,626 to 26, indicating a significant decrease in influenza mortality over the analyzed period. This overall downward trend in mortality from influenza and pneumonia could signify a positive impact on healthcare resources, although continued surveillance is crucial to manage potential future outbreaks and maintain healthcare system preparedness.
