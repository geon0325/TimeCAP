Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperature has experienced a gradual increase, reaching its peak in the latest hours. Humidity levels have fluctuated, with a notable decrease as the temperature peaked, suggesting an inverse relationship between temperature and humidity during this period. Air pressure remained relatively stable for much of the period but saw a significant decrease towards the end of the 24-hour window, which could lead to changing weather patterns, such as increased wind speeds or a shift in weather conditions. Wind conditions have been variable, with a period of calm followed by a sharp increase in wind speed recently, coupled with a shift in direction that could influence coastal conditions and marine activities. The interplay between these meteorological factors indicates a dynamic weather system that may result in clear skies due to lower humidity but could also bring about brisk conditions due to the increased wind speeds and changing air pressure.
