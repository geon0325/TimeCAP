Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature, with a general trend of cooling overnight followed by warming during the day. Humidity levels were consistently high, contributing to a muggy feeling, especially during the cooler nighttime hours when they peaked. Atmospheric pressure remained notably stable, indicating a period of settled weather without significant weather fronts or storm systems impacting the area. Wind speeds were light throughout the day, suggesting limited dispersion of pollutants and possibly leading to lower air quality. The wind direction varied but predominantly came from the southeast, which is typical for Houston and may have contributed to the maintenance of the high humidity levels due to the flow of moist air from the Gulf of Mexico.
