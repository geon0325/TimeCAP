Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature, with a distinct warming trend during the day followed by a period of cooling. Humidity levels experienced a significant increase overnight, reaching a peak that coincided with the lowest temperatures, indicating possible early morning fog or dew. The air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period but showed a slight decrease during the warmest part of the day, which is typical due to thermal expansion of the atmosphere. Wind speeds varied minimally, maintaining mostly light conditions that would not contribute significantly to weather changes. Wind direction was variable, though predominantly from the southeast, suggesting that moisture from the Gulf of Mexico could influence local weather patterns, possibly contributing to the higher humidity levels observed.
