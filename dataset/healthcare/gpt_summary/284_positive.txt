Over the past 20 weeks, the average ratio of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza was 6.26%, with the percentage of positive specimens fluctuating between 0.06% and 0.15%, indicating variability in weekly infection rates. The number of specimens tested showed a general declining trend, with an initial count of 34,680 reducing to 30,276 by the end of the period. Influenza A showed a lower positivity rate overall compared to Influenza B, with its positivity percentage peaking at 0.08% in week 10, but otherwise remaining at or below 0.07%. Influenza B demonstrated a higher positivity rate, reaching up to 0.09% in week 11, and it maintained a relatively consistent presence throughout the period. Given these data points, health systems should remain vigilant for potential outbreaks and ensure sufficient resources are allocated for testing and vaccination, especially considering the observed fluctuations and the persistent presence of Influenza B.
