Over the last 24 hours in New York City, there has been a notable fluctuation in temperature, with a trend towards warming. Humidity levels have varied significantly, peaking during the cooler early hours and subsequently decreasing as temperatures rose. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, indicating no major weather fronts moving through the area. Wind speeds were generally light with little variation, and the wind direction was primarily from the southwest, shifting to a northerly direction for a brief period before returning to a southwesterly alignment. This combination of stable pressure, light winds, and varying humidity suggests consistent weather patterns, but the rise in temperature could lead to increased discomfort due to higher humidity levels following the peak in temperature.
