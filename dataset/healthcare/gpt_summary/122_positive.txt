Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable decrease in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the overall positivity rate declining from 27% to 1.02%. The reduction is observed in both Influenza A and B, with the positivity rates of Influenza A decreasing from 17.34% to 0.58% and Influenza B from 9.65% to 0.45%. This trend suggests a significant decrease in influenza activity over the observed period. The decrease in influenza cases could lead to a reduced burden on healthcare resources, including fewer hospitalizations and a lesser need for antiviral medications. However, healthcare systems must remain vigilant for possible future outbreaks and maintain influenza surveillance, vaccination, and public health measures.
