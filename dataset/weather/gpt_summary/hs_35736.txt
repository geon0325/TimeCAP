Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable fluctuation in temperature with a pattern of cooling followed by a significant warming trend, indicating a transient weather system passing through. Humidity levels exhibited a peak which coincided with the cooler temperatures, suggesting possible early morning or nighttime condensation, and potentially foggy conditions which would have cleared as temperatures increased. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight variation that indicates steady weather conditions; however, the rise in pressure during the cooler periods could be associated with the transient system affecting the region. Wind speeds were consistently low throughout the period, suggesting a lack of significant weather fronts moving through that would otherwise stir up stronger winds. The wind direction shifted notably from southeasterly to northeasterly and then to easterly, which may have contributed to the changes in temperature and humidity experienced in Houston.
