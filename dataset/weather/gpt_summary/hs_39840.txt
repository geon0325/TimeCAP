Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have exhibited a warming trend with a peak in the late afternoon, followed by a slight cooling period towards the evening. Humidity levels started high in the early hours and saw a significant decrease midday, likely contributing to a sensation of more comfortable conditions despite the rise in temperature. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, indicating a period of steady weather without the immediate presence of strong frontal systems. Wind speeds varied moderately with some increase towards the end of the period, suggesting a potential shift in weather patterns or the approach of a weather system. Wind direction was predominantly from the south to the southeast, which is typical for Houston and may have contributed to the transportation of warmer air masses into the region.
