Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have experienced minor fluctuations around a relatively stable average, suggesting a consistent weather pattern without significant warm or cold fronts passing through. Humidity levels remained high throughout the day, peaking at saturation during some hours, which could contribute to a feeling of mugginess and may indicate the potential for fog or dew. Air pressure showed a slight decreasing trend, which is often associated with the approach of a low-pressure system that could bring unsettled weather conditions in the near future. Wind speeds were generally light and fairly constant, indicating a calm period without significant gusts or storms. The wind direction varied but primarily stayed within a southerly to southwesterly range, shifting to westerly and then northerly in the later hours, which may bring changes in temperature and moisture levels as different air masses move into the area.
