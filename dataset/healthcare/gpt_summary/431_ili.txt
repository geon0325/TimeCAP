Over the last 20 weeks, the proportion of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases has remained consistently below the 2.9% severity benchmark, with a peak of 2.07% in week one and a low of 1.19% in week fifteen. The age group 0-4 consistently presented the highest number of ILI cases, with a notable increase from 5,678 cases in week 16 to 8,234 cases in week 20. The age group 5-24 showed a sharp increase in ILI cases in the latter weeks, jumping from 6,836 cases in week 15 to 13,151 cases in week 20, which may indicate a trend towards a younger demographic being more affected as the weeks progress. Each age group experienced an uptick in ILI cases in the final week of reporting, suggesting a potential rise in ILI activity overall. Despite these increases, the healthcare system has not reached a high-alert threshold according to the set benchmark, but continued monitoring is warranted for any significant changes in trends that may require a response.
