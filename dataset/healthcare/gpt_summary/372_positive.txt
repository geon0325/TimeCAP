The data indicates a significant decrease in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza over the last 20 weeks, declining from a peak of 26.27% to 1.06%. Notably, Influenza A has consistently been the dominant strain, though its prevalence has also sharply decreased from 26.15% to 0.55%. Meanwhile, the proportion of Influenza B cases remained relatively low but has slightly increased in recent weeks, suggesting a potential shift in the circulating strains. The overall decrease in influenza positivity suggests a downward trend in influenza activity; however, the healthcare system should remain vigilant for potential changes, such as increases in Influenza B or the emergence of new strains. Continuous monitoring of influenza trends is essential for resource allocation and preparedness for potential future outbreaks.
