Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual decline in temperature, transitioning from warmer conditions earlier in the day to cooler temperatures by nightfall. Humidity levels have remained high, peaking during the nighttime hours, which is typical of the Houston area and suggests the potential for a muggy atmosphere. Atmospheric pressure has been steadily increasing, indicating stable weather conditions and possibly predicting fair weather in the short term. Wind speeds have been mostly light and variable with a slight increase in the evening, which could contribute to a slight wind chill effect during the cooler night hours. The wind direction has been predominantly from the south, with some variability, suggesting the possible advection of both moisture and warmth from the Gulf of Mexico, which is a common pattern for Houston's climate.
