Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality from influenza or pneumonia as a proportion of total deaths has remained below the average ratio of 7.84%, with a fluctuating trend that indicates some weekly variations. The highest observed weekly mortality ratio was 6.19% in the latest week, while the lowest was 5.38% in week 11, suggesting a possible recent upward trend in the proportion of deaths attributable to these respiratory conditions. The total number of deaths due to pneumonia consistently exceeded those from influenza, with the former ranging from 2,695 to 3,178 deaths per week and the latter remaining below 20, with occasional dips to single digits. The total number of deaths reported each week varied, with a peak at week 19 (52,143 deaths) and a low at week 8 (49,362 deaths), but these fluctuations did not significantly affect the weekly percentages of deaths due to influenza or pneumonia. This data is critical for healthcare providers and policymakers as it suggests a stable but persistent impact of influenza and pneumonia on mortality, underscoring the need for continued surveillance, prevention, and treatment measures, especially considering the recent slight increase in the mortality ratio.
