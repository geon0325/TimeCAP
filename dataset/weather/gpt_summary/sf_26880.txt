Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature with a general warming trend during the daytime and a cooling trend overnight. Humidity levels remained high throughout the period, indicating a significant presence of moisture in the air which could potentially lead to foggy conditions, especially given the high humidity readings at cooler temperatures. Air pressure showed a noticeable decreasing trend, which may suggest the approach of a weather system that could lead to changes in weather patterns, such as increased cloudiness or precipitation. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with some increase during the day, which may help to disperse fog and low clouds, possibly leading to clearer conditions intermittently. The wind direction varied significantly throughout the day but was predominantly from the west-northwest, which is typical for the region and may have contributed to the transportation of maritime air and moisture inland.
