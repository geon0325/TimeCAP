Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable upward trend in both the absolute number and the proportion of deaths attributable to influenza or pneumonia. The percentage of deaths due to these causes has increased from 5.30% to 7.30%, which is below the 20-week average of 7.84%. Notably, there was a sharp rise in influenza-related deaths from week 14 onwards, with numbers increasing almost tenfold from 16 to 519 deaths. This surge may be indicative of a particularly virulent strain or a lapse in public health controls. The increasing trend, especially in the context of a peak that surpasses the average ratio of mortality, suggests a significant pressure on the healthcare system, potentially necessitating increased healthcare resources and public health intervention.
