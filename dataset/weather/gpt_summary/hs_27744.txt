Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature, showing a general pattern of cooling during the overnight hours and a gradual warming trend during the day. Humidity levels were relatively high but showed a notable dip in the afternoon, which could have offered some relief from the mugginess typically associated with high humidity. Air pressure saw an overall increase which is indicative of stable weather conditions possibly moving into the area. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate with a few instances of slightly higher speeds, suggesting a breezy but not particularly windy period. The wind direction was variable but predominantly from the north and northeast, which could be associated with the cooler temperatures observed during the early morning hours.
