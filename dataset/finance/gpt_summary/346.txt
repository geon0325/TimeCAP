Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a general upward trend, increasing from 2953.91 to 3066.59, indicative of rising investor confidence. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, peaked at 40.79 on the 17th day before subsiding, suggesting a period of heightened market stress followed by a partial stabilization. International indices like the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 also exhibited upward momentum, although the Nikkei faced a sharp decline on the last day, possibly due to localized market factors or global economic concerns impacting the Japanese market. Gold futures displayed volatility with a slight downward bias, ending at 1720.30 from an opening of 1731.80, reflecting investors' fluctuating appetite for safe-haven assets. Currency markets saw the EUR/USD and USD/JPY exchange rates mostly strengthening against the USD, while the USD/CNY remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting a complex interplay of currency valuation factors amidst global economic uncertainty.
