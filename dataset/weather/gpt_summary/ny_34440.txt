Over the past day in New York City, the temperature exhibited a typical diurnal pattern, starting off warm, cooling slightly overnight, and warming up again during the day. Relative humidity levels fluctuated slightly but remained at moderate levels throughout the period, which could indicate a stable atmosphere with no immediate signs of precipitation. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively steady, suggesting stable weather conditions without significant fronts or storms in the immediate vicinity. Wind speeds varied, with some periods of increased gustiness, particularly during the day, which could lead to wind chills that make the temperature feel cooler than the actual readings.
