Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have exhibited a gradual decrease throughout the night, reaching a low in the early morning before starting to rise again after sunrise. Humidity levels have seen significant fluctuations, with a notable peak at 100 percent, indicative of possible fog or mist conditions, before dropping sharply towards the end of the 24-hour period, which could suggest the arrival of drier air masses. Air pressure has remained relatively stable initially, but a substantial increase later on suggests the strengthening of a high-pressure system in the area, which is often associated with clearer skies and calmer weather. Wind speeds have been moderate and showed some variability, but without any extreme gusts that would prompt weather advisories. Wind direction has shifted throughout the day, with notable changes from southerly to easterly and then westerly directions, hinting at changing weather systems moving through the region.
