Over the past 20 market days, the S&P 500 has experienced volatility, achieving a peak of 3232.39 before dropping to 3002.10, followed by a partial recovery to 3083.76, indicating a level of instability in the U.S. equity market. The VIX, or Volatility Index, corroborates this with an elevated spike to 40.79, suggesting increased market uncertainty, although it has since receded to 32.22. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 also reflect this turbulence, with the Nikkei 225 showing a notable drop to 21530.95 before regaining some ground, while the FTSE 100 similarly slumped and then partially rebounded, concluding at 6147.10. Gold Futures have remained relatively stable with a slight uptrend, peaking at 1772.10, which could imply a flight to safety among investors. Currency exchange rates have shown minor fluctuations, with the EUR/USD and USD/JPY pairs indicating a relatively stable U.S. dollar, while the USD/CNY exchange rate experienced minor strengthening of the dollar against the Chinese yuan, ending at 7.08.
