Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature followed by a slight decrease, indicating a typical diurnal temperature variation with warmer conditions in the afternoon. Humidity levels have been high and even reached saturation during the early hours, which could have resulted in foggy conditions or dew. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with a notable increase at one point, which could suggest the transient influence of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds have been generally low, suggesting a period of calm weather, although there was a period with no wind, which might have contributed to the high humidity levels by reducing air circulation. Wind direction varied significantly, suggesting the influence of local weather patterns or a change in the larger-scale wind regime.
