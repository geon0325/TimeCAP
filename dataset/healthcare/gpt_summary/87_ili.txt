Over the last 20 weeks, the data reflects a gradual increase in the percentage of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases among the patients observed, with the proportion of ILI cases rising above the baseline threshold towards the later weeks. Notably, the age group 5-24 has seen a significant spike in ILI cases recently, which suggests a potential focal point for public health interventions, especially in schools and universities. The oldest age group, those 65 and over, initially had a slower increase in ILI incidence but has also surpassed the baseline in the most recent weeks, indicating increased vulnerability in this demographic. The healthcare system may experience added strain due to this uptick in ILI cases, necessitating preparedness in terms of resources and staffing. It is crucial for public health authorities to closely monitor these trends, promote flu vaccination, and prepare for potential increases in healthcare demand, especially given the observed escalation in ILI cases above the baseline percentage.
