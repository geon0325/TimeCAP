Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature, exhibiting a typical diurnal pattern with cooler temperatures in the early hours and a gradual increase peaking in the late afternoon. Humidity levels started high in the early hours, decreased significantly during the day, and then showed variability towards the evening, which could indicate the passage of a frontal system or changing air masses. Air pressure experienced a significant drop followed by a sharp increase, suggesting that a weather disturbance may have moved through the area, potentially leading to rapid weather changes. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate throughout the day with some hour-to-hour variability, not indicative of any severe weather conditions. The wind direction displayed a shift from northerly to southerly and later veered towards southeasterly, which could be associated with the movement of a weather system across the region and may have contributed to the variations in temperature and pressure observed.
