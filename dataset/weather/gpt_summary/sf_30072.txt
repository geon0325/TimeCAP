Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, followed by a moderate increase as the day progressed. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuations, with very low humidity in the early hours, a substantial rise towards the middle of the day, and then a decrease again towards the evening. The air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight increase towards the latter part of the period, which is indicative of stable weather conditions. Wind speeds were variable with a peak that could have contributed to cooler, windier conditions at that time. The wind direction was predominantly from the south to the southwest, with occasional shifts towards the west, indicating the movement of weather systems from the Pacific Ocean towards the coast.
