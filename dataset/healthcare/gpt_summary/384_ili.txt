Over the past 20 weeks, the data indicates a declining trend in the proportion of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases among the total number of patients, with the percentage dropping from an initial 2.60% to a low of 1.53% before slightly increasing again to 2.30%. Throughout the period, none of the weekly ILI ratios exceeded the 2.9% severity benchmark. The age group 0-4 consistently showed the highest number of ILI cases, with a noticeable increase in the latter weeks, suggesting a potential rise in ILI transmission within this demographic. The age groups 5-24 and 25-49 also experienced a recent uptick in ILI cases, while the counts in older age groups (50-64, 65 or more) remained relatively stable and lower in comparison. These trends suggest that while the overall ILI activity remains below the threshold of significant concern, there is a need for continuous monitoring, especially among younger populations, to manage and preempt any potential increase in healthcare demand.
