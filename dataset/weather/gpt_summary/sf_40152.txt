Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have fluctuated significantly, peaking during the day and dropping notably during the early hours, consistent with diurnal patterns. Humidity levels have shown considerable variation, with particularly high values in the early morning hours, which could result in morning fog or dew, a common occurrence in coastal cities like San Francisco. Air pressure has generally remained stable, with a slight decreasing trend observed recently, which might indicate an approaching weather system that could lead to changes in the weather pattern.
