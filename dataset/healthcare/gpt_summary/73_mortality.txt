Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality ratio from influenza or pneumonia to the total number of deaths fluctuated slightly but remained consistently below the average ratio of 7.84%, with a low of 5.21% and a high of 5.85%. Notably, there is no clear upward or downward trend in the proportion of deaths due to these illnesses, indicating a relative stability in their impact on overall mortality during this period. Despite minor weekly variations, the number of deaths attributed to pneumonia greatly outnumbers those from influenza, suggesting that pneumonia is a more significant contributor to the overall mortality from these respiratory conditions. The number of deaths from influenza has shown a modest increase in the last three weeks, which warrants close monitoring for potential trends in subsequent weeks. The consistently lower than average mortality ratio suggests that other causes may be contributing more significantly to the total number of deaths, or that there has been some success in managing and preventing deaths from influenza and pneumonia.
