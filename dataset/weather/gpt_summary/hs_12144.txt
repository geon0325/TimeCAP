Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has displayed a gradual upward trend, indicating a warming pattern with the warmest readings in the late afternoon to early evening. Meanwhile, humidity levels have experienced fluctuations, starting high in the early hours, decreasing toward the middle of the day, and then rising again at night, which could contribute to varying levels of comfort and potential for condensation or fog formation. Air pressure has remained relatively stable with a slight decrease, suggesting steady weather conditions but the potential for minor weather changes. Wind speeds have been moderate with occasional higher gusts, primarily maintaining a southerly direction, which is typical for this region and may contribute to the transport of moisture-rich air. A notable shift in wind direction to the northwest occurred in the last recorded hour, which could signal an incoming change in weather conditions, possibly a front passing through the area.
