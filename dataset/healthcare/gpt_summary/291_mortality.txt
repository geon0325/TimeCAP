Over the last 20 weeks, the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia to total deaths has shown an increasing trend, rising from 6.47% to 13.15%, which significantly exceeds the average ratio of 7.84%. This increase coincides with a notable spike in total deaths, from 58,047 to 71,176, in the last five weeks of the reported period. The number of deaths attributed to Influenza has increased modestly from 16 to 58 deaths per week, whereas deaths from Pneumonia have surged markedly, from 3,810 to 9,304. The period between weeks 10 and 20 is particularly concerning, as the ratio more than doubled from 6.15% to 13.15%, suggesting a critical healthcare situation that may necessitate increased healthcare resources and interventions to manage Pneumonia cases. These trends indicate a potential healthcare strain and underscore the need for public health awareness, vaccination, and preventive measures against respiratory infections.
