Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable increase in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, rising from 0.92% to 16.32%, indicating a significant uptick in flu activity. The data reflects a higher prevalence of Influenza A, which started at 0.56% and peaked at 14.99% in week 15, before slightly decreasing to 10.93% in the latest week, while Influenza B showed a continuous increase from 0.35% to 5.39% over the same period. The peak of positive specimens occurred in week 15, where the combined positive rate for Influenza A and B reached 18.27%, followed by a slight decline in subsequent weeks. This surge in flu cases has likely contributed to increased healthcare utilization and could strain healthcare resources, necessitating enhanced influenza surveillance, vaccination efforts, and public health preparedness. The persistent rise in the ratio of positive specimens for both Influenza A and B well above the 20-week average of 6.26% suggests a higher-than-average flu activity that may continue to impact population health and healthcare services.
