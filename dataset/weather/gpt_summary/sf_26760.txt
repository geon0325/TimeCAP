Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures showed a warming trend with a peak in the late afternoon before cooling slightly toward the evening. Humidity levels varied significantly, with higher values in the early morning hours indicative of more moisture in the air, which gradually decreased toward the end of the period, suggesting drier conditions. The air pressure experienced a notable drop during the late afternoon hours, which could be associated with a passing weather system, but it subsequently returned to earlier levels by the end of the period. Wind speeds were generally light, with a slight increase in the evening, while wind direction shifted throughout the day, with a more pronounced change in the early morning and late evening hours, indicating variable wind patterns. These indicators suggest a fairly stable weather pattern with a possibility of changing conditions due to the observed drop in pressure and the variation in wind direction.
