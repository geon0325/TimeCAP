The data over the last 20 weeks shows a fluctuating trend in the incidence of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) across different age groups, with an initial peak that eventually declined to rates below the baseline but rose again to near-baseline levels in recent weeks. The highest number of ILI cases is consistently reported in the youngest age group (0-4 years), suggesting a heightened vulnerability or increased transmission in this demographic. While all age groups experienced a decrease in ILI cases following the peak, there's been a gradual resurgence, indicating potential seasonal variations or changes in virus transmission patterns. The overall ratio of ILI patients has remained above the baseline for only the first week of the 20-week period, but a recent uptick nearing baseline suggests that health systems should be alert for a possible increase in ILI cases. This trend necessitates continued monitoring and possibly increased healthcare resources to manage a surge and prevent healthcare system overload, particularly for the youngest patients who are most affected.
