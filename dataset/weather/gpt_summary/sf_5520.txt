Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, which later increased, suggesting a typical diurnal pattern with cooler conditions at night followed by warming during the day. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with the highest values occurring concurrently with the lowest temperatures, indicative of a possible coastal influence with more moisture present during cooler periods. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight increase in the middle of the period, potentially signaling a transient high-pressure system affecting the area. Wind speed varied, with periods of calm interspersed with moderate breezes, and the wind direction shifted throughout the day, indicating that different air masses could have influenced the local weather conditions. The combination of these factors suggests a weather pattern influenced by both diurnal cycles and transient atmospheric conditions, which is typical for San Francisco's maritime climate.
