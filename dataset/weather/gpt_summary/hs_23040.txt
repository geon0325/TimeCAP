Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has shown a slight increasing trend, indicating warmer conditions moving into the area. Humidity levels have fluctuated but remain high, suggesting a muggy atmosphere that could potentially lead to the formation of fog or mist, especially during the early morning or late evening hours. Air pressure has been relatively stable, with only minor variations, which is indicative of steady weather patterns without immediate signs of significant weather fronts or storms approaching. Wind speeds have been consistently light, which may contribute to a slower dispersion of any airborne moisture or pollutants, leading to possible air quality concerns. The wind direction has gradually shifted from a southeasterly to a southerly direction, which is typical for this region and may bring in additional moisture from the Gulf, maintaining the humidity levels.
