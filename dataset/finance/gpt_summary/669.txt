Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown moderate volatility with a downward trend, declining from a high of 4528.79 to 4455.48, indicating some investor caution in the equity market. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, has fluctuated but notably spiked to 25.71, aligning with the largest drops in the S&P 500, which suggests increased market uncertainty during that period. The Nikkei 225 has experienced a more noticeable upward trend, moving from 27641.14 to 30248.81, indicative of positive investor sentiment in the Japanese market. Commodities such as Gold and Crude Oil futures have seen some fluctuations, with Gold decreasing from 1816.60 to 1749.70, reflective of a decrease in safe-haven demand, while Crude Oil increased from 68.74 to 73.98, which could indicate a bullish outlook on energy demand. Exchange rates have remained relatively stable, with minor depreciations in the EUR/USD and slight variations in USD/JPY and USD/CNY, suggesting currency markets have not experienced significant shocks during this period.
