Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable decline in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the initial average ratio of 6.26% decreasing to 2.39% by the end of the period. The data shows a substantial reduction in positive cases for both Influenza A and B, with Influenza A positive percentages dropping from 22.19% to 1.01%, and Influenza B decreasing from 4.75% to 1.38%. The overall ratio of positive specimens peaked in the early weeks, maintaining a level above 26% for the first four weeks, before steadily declining to below 3% in the final week. This trend suggests a significant decrease in influenza activity, which may lead to a reduction in the burden on the healthcare system regarding influenza management and treatment. However, continued surveillance is essential to monitor for potential resurgences or new strains of the virus that could impact public health.
