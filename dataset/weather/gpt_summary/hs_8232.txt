Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, with the warmest conditions occurring in the late afternoon to early evening. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly but showed a general decrease towards the evening, which, coupled with the increasing temperatures, may have led to less comfortable conditions. Air pressure showed variability with a notable increase during the midday hours, suggesting a potential shift in weather patterns. Wind speeds were mostly light with occasional calm periods, and no significant gusts, which would have minimal impact on dispersing atmospheric pollutants and providing relief from the heat. The wind direction was predominantly from the southeast to east-southeast, typical for Houston, which could bring moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, potentially affecting local humidity and precipitation patterns.
