Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have remained relatively stable with a slight warming trend observed towards the end of the period. Humidity levels have been quite high throughout, even reaching saturation at some points, which may have led to foggy conditions, especially during the early morning and night. Air pressure has shown a gradual increase, indicating stable weather conditions and possibly clearer skies following any fog dissipation. Wind speeds have been mostly consistent, with a slight increase recently, potentially contributing to the dispersal of any fog or low-level cloud cover. The wind direction has been predominantly coming from the west-southwest, which is typical for San Francisco due to its coastal location and could influence the movement of marine air masses into the city.
