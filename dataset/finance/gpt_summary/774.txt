Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a general downward trend, dropping from an initial high of 4431.85 to closing at 4288.70, indicating potential market uncertainty or correction. The VIX, often referred to as the "fear index," has increased overall from 27.66 to 30.32, which supports the view of heightened market volatility and investor anxiety. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have mirrored this volatility, with the Nikkei 225 declining sharply towards the end of the period to 25970.82, and the FTSE 100 experiencing a significant drop on the last day to 7207.00, which may reflect concerns over global economic conditions. Contrary to equities, Gold Futures have seen an ascent, moving from 1784.90 to 1925.10, suggesting a flight to safety among investors. The foreign exchange market shows a slight depreciation of the Euro and the Japanese Yen against the USD, while the USD/CNY pair indicates a modest strengthening of the USD against the Chinese Yuan, potentially pointing to a preference for holding USD in times of market stress.
