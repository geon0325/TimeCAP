Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature, initially decreasing to a minimum before gradually rising again, indicative of a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels have been highly variable, reaching saturation at certain points, which could have resulted in periods of fog or mist, especially during cooler hours. Air pressure was relatively stable for most of the time, with a slight increase throughout the day, suggesting stable weather conditions, but experienced a significant drop towards the end of the period, which might signal an approaching weather system. Wind speeds varied, with a peak suggesting the possibility of breezier conditions at times, and wind direction was predominantly from the west with a brief shift to southerly winds before returning to a northerly direction, which is common for coastal cities like San Francisco. These combined indicators point to a dynamic weather pattern, with the potential for changing conditions such as increased wind activity or the development of a new weather front due to the drop in air pressure.
