Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the average ratio of 7.84%. The data indicate that the ratio peaked at 10.72% in week 9, which suggests a significant increase in deaths from these conditions relative to total deaths at that point. However, following week 9, there was a downward trend, with the ratio decreasing to a low of 5.20% in week 17, which is substantially below the average. Despite this decrease, the last reported week shows an uptick in the number of deaths from Influenza, which tripled compared to the previous week, although the overall mortality ratio only increased marginally to 5.60%. This volatility in the mortality ratio and the recent increase in influenza deaths could indicate potential seasonal patterns or emerging health concerns that may require attention from healthcare providers and policymakers.
