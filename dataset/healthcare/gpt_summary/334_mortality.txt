Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates that the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia to the total number of deaths has fluctuated but generally remained below the average of 7.84%. The percentage started at 5.64% and showed a slight upward trend, ending at 6.06%, with the highest values in the final weeks at or above 6.00%. The total number of deaths peaked in the last two weeks at 59,545 and 59,717, respectively, coinciding with a slight increase in deaths attributed to Influenza or Pneumonia. Notably, the number of deaths from influenza alone has shown variability but spiked to 56 in the last week, the highest recorded in the observed period, suggesting a potential uptick in influenza mortality. This trend, coupled with the gradual increase in the mortality ratio, may signal a need for heightened vigilance and resource allocation in healthcare systems to manage and prevent Influenza and Pneumonia, particularly going into periods traditionally associated with higher incidence.
