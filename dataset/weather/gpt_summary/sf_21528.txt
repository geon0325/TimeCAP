Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature, ranging from moderate to mildly cooler conditions, indicative of typical coastal climate variability. Humidity levels have been relatively high throughout the period, peaking during the night and early morning hours, which could have led to instances of fog, particularly in areas close to the bay. Air pressure has remained fairly stable, suggesting a consistent weather pattern without significant disturbances. Wind speeds have been mostly light to gentle, with little variation, maintaining calm conditions that are unlikely to contribute to any immediate weather changes. The wind direction has predominantly been westerly to northwesterly, which is common for the region and can bring cool ocean air into the city, affecting local temperatures and fog patterns.
