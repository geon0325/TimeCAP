Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperatures have experienced a typical diurnal cycle with the coolest readings occurring in the early morning hours and peaking in the late afternoon, indicative of clear sky conditions allowing for radiational cooling and warming. Humidity levels showed a significant spike at one point, possibly suggesting the presence of localized fog or a marine layer that is common in the region, but otherwise remained relatively stable which is typical for a coastal Californian climate. Air pressure readings fluctuated slightly but stayed within a range that would be associated with stable weather conditions, with a notable increase towards the latter part of the period which could indicate the approach of a high-pressure system leading to settled weather. Wind speeds were generally light and variable, with an occasional calm, which is consistent with a high-pressure scenario and no significant weather fronts affecting the area. The wind direction was predominantly from the west-northwest, which is a common pattern for San Francisco, likely driven by the Pacific high-pressure system and the local sea breeze effect.
