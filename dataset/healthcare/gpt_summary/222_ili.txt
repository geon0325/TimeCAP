The analysis of the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data over the past 20 weeks indicates a downward trend in the overall percentage of ILI patients relative to the total number of patients, with the ratio consistently staying below the baseline of 2.9%. Throughout the period, the youngest age group (0-4 years) consistently exhibited the highest count of ILI cases among the age-specific data, suggesting a higher vulnerability or exposure within this demographic. In contrast, ILI cases in older age groups (50-64 and 65 or more) remained the lowest, which may reflect better immunity, lower exposure, or possibly higher vaccination rates among these populations. The recent weeks have shown a slight increase in ILI ratios, hinting at a potential uptick in ILI activity, which healthcare systems should monitor closely for any signs of a more significant resurgence. Given that all age groups have shown an increase in ILI cases in the most recent weeks, healthcare providers should be prepared for a potential uptick in demand for medical services related to ILI symptoms.
