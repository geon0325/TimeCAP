Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a concerning upward trend in the ratio of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, increasing from an initial 0.90% to a peak of 10.78% in the most recent week. Both Influenza A and B have demonstrated a significant rise in positivity, with Influenza A showing a more pronounced increase from 0.38% to 9.52%, suggesting a predominant circulation of this subtype in the current period. Influenza B also showed an increase but at a slower rate, from 0.52% to 1.27%. This surge in flu cases, notably in the latter weeks where the positivity rate exceeds the 20-week average of 6.26%, could strain healthcare systems due to increased demand for medical care and diagnostic testing. The trend underscores the necessity for public health preparedness, including vaccination and antiviral treatment strategies, to manage the rising influenza incidence effectively.
