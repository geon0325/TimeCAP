Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant fluctuation in mortality due to Influenza or Pneumonia when compared to the total number of deaths. The mortality ratio started below the 20-week average of 7.84% but exhibited an increasing trend, peaking at 15.78% in week 14, before gradually declining to 9.62% by week 20. This peak coincides with a noticeable increase in the total number of deaths, rising from an average of around 59,000 to over 78,000, suggesting a potential outbreak or seasonal spike in respiratory illnesses. Despite the decline in mortality ratio towards the end of the period, the number of deaths from pneumonia remains notably higher than those from influenza, which may indicate a greater burden on healthcare resources from pneumonia. The overall trend indicates a need for continued monitoring and potentially increased healthcare resources during periods of higher pneumonia incidence.
