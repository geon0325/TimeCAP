Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, followed by a significant increase, and then a slight decrease again, suggesting the presence of a frontal system passing through the area. Humidity levels started relatively high but saw a dramatic drop, which typically indicates the passage of a cold front that brought drier air into the region. Air pressure was on the rise for most of the period, reaching a peak before dropping sharply, which often precedes changes in weather patterns, such as the arrival of a weather disturbance. Wind speeds remained mostly constant and moderate but decreased to a light breeze, which could contribute to a more settled weather pattern in the short term. The wind direction was predominantly from the northwest, shifting to west and then to the southwest, reflecting the movement of the weather system across the city.
