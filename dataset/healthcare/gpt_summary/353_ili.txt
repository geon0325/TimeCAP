Over the last 20 weeks, the incidence of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) within the monitored population has demonstrated a significant fluctuation, with a noticeable peak surpassing the established baseline threshold. The age group 25-49 showed the most pronounced rise in ILI cases, indicating a heightened vulnerability or increased exposure within this demographic. Following the peak, there was a marked decline in ILI ratios across all age groups, indicating a potential easing of the ILI spread or improved control measures. Despite this decline, the ratios have not yet returned to the levels observed at the beginning of the 20-week period, suggesting continued circulation of ILI in the population. Healthcare systems should remain vigilant, as even post-peak periods require resource readiness for potential ILI cases and the possibility of another increase in incidence rates.
