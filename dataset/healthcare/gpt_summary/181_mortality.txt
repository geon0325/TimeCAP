Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia as a proportion of total deaths has shown a general downward trend, starting above the 20-week average of 7.84% and peaking at 10.72% in week 7, but declining to 5.59% by week 20. The decline in the ratio of mortality due to these respiratory conditions suggests an improvement in the management or a seasonal reduction of Influenza and Pneumonia cases. Despite the overall decrease in the ratio, the absolute number of deaths from pneumonia remains significant, with a minor rebound in the last reported week, indicating a need for continued vigilance and possibly suggesting a fluctuating pattern in pneumonia-related mortality. The number of deaths from influenza has varied minimally, with a noticeable increase in the last three weeks, which may warrant attention to prevent a potential upward trend in influenza mortality. The observed patterns highlight the importance of monitoring these diseases and may reflect the impact of public health interventions, healthcare delivery effectiveness, or changes in the prevalence of these infections.
