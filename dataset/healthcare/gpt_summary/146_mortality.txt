Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable increase in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, rising from 5.75% to 7.74%, exceeding the average ratio of 7.84% in the most recent week. The data shows a spike in deaths attributed to influenza in the 11th week, with the number of influenza-related deaths increasing from 24 to 634 by the 20th week, indicating a significant seasonal or possibly pandemic surge. Pneumonia-related deaths have also risen steadily from 3065 to 3976 deaths over the same period. This surge has coincided with an overall increase in total deaths, from 53763 to 59570, suggesting a potential strain on healthcare resources. These trends underscore the importance of reinforcing healthcare systems, preventive measures, and possibly vaccination programs to manage the increased burden of respiratory infections.
