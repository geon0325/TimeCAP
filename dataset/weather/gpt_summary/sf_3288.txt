Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures displayed a typical diurnal pattern with a peak during the day and a drop at night, remaining within a comfortable range. Humidity levels varied significantly, starting at moderate levels, increasing during the night, and decreasing sharply towards the end of the period, which could affect local comfort levels and might have implications for fog formation. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight increase towards the middle of the period, indicating stable weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally low, with a period of calm conditions, suggesting limited dispersion of air pollutants and possibly leading to lower air quality. The predominant wind direction shifted significantly from westerly to northerly and then became variable, which could influence coastal weather patterns and temperature distribution.
