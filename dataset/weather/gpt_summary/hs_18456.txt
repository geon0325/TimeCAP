Over the last 24 hours in Houston, the temperature experienced a noticeable increase, indicating a warming trend that peaked in the late afternoon. Humidity levels showed a general decrease through the day, suggesting drier air moving into the area as the temperature rose. Air pressure gradually declined, which is often associated with the approach of a weather system that could potentially bring changes in the weather pattern. Wind speeds increased towards the evening, reaching their highest values at the end of the 24-hour period, while the wind direction remained relatively consistent, with winds coming predominantly from the south to the south-west. This combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, dropping air pressure, and increasing wind speeds could signal the onset of a front that may affect local weather conditions.
