Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual rise in temperature, reaching a peak in the later hours before a slight decrease towards the end of the period. Humidity levels showed some variability but tended to increase overall, which could result in a feeling of increased mugginess. Air pressure has been on a gentle decline after a period of relative stability, suggesting a potential change in weather patterns or the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds varied with periods of calm and breezy conditions; however, there were significant gusts in the latter part of the day. The wind direction was predominantly from the northwest, shifting to southerly and then varying again, which may influence temperature and humidity levels as different air masses move into the area.
