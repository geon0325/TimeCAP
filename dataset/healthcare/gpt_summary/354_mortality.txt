Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the mortality ratio of influenza or pneumonia to total deaths, starting at 6.47% and peaking at 9.03% before ending at 7.16%, which is below the 20-week average of 7.84%. Despite the overall number of deaths fluctuating, peaking at 70,168 in week 11, there has been a consistent upward trend in deaths attributable to influenza or pneumonia, with numbers rising sharply from 57 to 1,048 deaths from influenza and from 3,831 to 5,428 deaths from pneumonia by week 11. The subsequent decline in mortality from these causes still leaves the end-of-period figures higher than at the beginning, with influenza-related deaths at 385 and pneumonia at 3,902 in the final week. This trend suggests a seasonal pattern with a peak in the colder weeks, which could strain healthcare resources, requiring a targeted response in preparation for such peaks. The overall decrease in the ratio towards the end of the period may indicate an improvement in managing these illnesses or a relative increase in other causes of death.
