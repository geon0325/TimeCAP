Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable increase in the percentage of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases across all age groups, with a significant rise observed in the latter weeks as the ratio of ILI patients exceeded the baseline threshold. The most pronounced surge in ILI cases has been among the 5-24 and 25-49 age groups, indicating that these populations may be particularly affected during the current period. The consistent upward trend culminated in the ILI ratio more than doubling the baseline, suggesting a potential strain on healthcare resources due to increased demand for medical care and diagnostic services. The steep increase in ILI cases in the youngest age group (0-4 years) and school-aged children (5-24 years) might have implications for pediatric health services and schools. Public health officials need to closely monitor these trends and potentially bolster influenza prevention strategies, such as vaccination and public education, to mitigate the impact on the healthcare system and the wider community.
