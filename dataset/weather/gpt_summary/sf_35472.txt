Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a noticeable drop in temperature during the early morning hours, which then gradually rose to reach peak daytime values before stabilizing. Humidity levels were significantly high throughout the period, particularly in the early morning, indicating a likelihood of morning fog or mist, which typically characterizes the city's microclimate. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight increase at one point, suggesting stable weather conditions without significant systems moving through the area. Wind speeds decreased to calm conditions during the day, with little to no wind in the latter hours, which could lead to a build-up of pollutants or allergens due to lack of dispersion. The wind direction varied, showing a shift from predominantly northwesterly to a brief southerly direction before returning to a northwesterly pattern, which is typical for San Francisco's coastal weather dynamics.
