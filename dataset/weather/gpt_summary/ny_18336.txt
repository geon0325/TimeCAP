Over the last 24 hours in New York City, temperatures have exhibited a slight cooling trend overall with a dip during the earlier hours, followed by a moderate rise, and then a gradual decline as the day progressed into the night. Relative humidity levels have seen fluctuations, starting at lower values before increasing significantly, which could have enhanced the feeling of chilliness in the air. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable at first but then experienced a significant increase, suggesting a potential change in weather patterns, such as the arrival of a high-pressure system which could lead to clearer skies. Wind speeds varied from light to moderate breezes, with some gustier winds observed, indicating a brisk and possibly changing wind pattern throughout the period. The wind direction has been predominantly from the south to southwest, with a shift to westerly winds later on, which is characteristic of a passing weather front and could be associated with the observed changes in temperature and pressure.
