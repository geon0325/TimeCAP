Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a slight fluctuation in temperature with a general upward trend during the day and a cooling trend at night, consistent with typical diurnal patterns. Humidity levels have shown variability, with peaks coinciding with the cooler temperatures in the early morning hours, suggesting a possible increase in the likelihood of morning dew or fog formation. Air pressure has remained relatively stable, with a slight increase observed, which could indicate stable weather conditions persisting in the short term. Wind speeds have been mostly light to moderate, with a gradual increase noted towards the end of the period, which might influence the dispersion of any present air pollutants. Wind direction has been variable, but predominantly easterly, potentially bringing moisture from the Gulf of Mexico into the region, which could contribute to cloud formation and humidity levels.
