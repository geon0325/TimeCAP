Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, suggesting a warming trend. Humidity levels varied significantly, with periods of complete saturation indicating the possibility of fog or low clouds, especially during the cooler early morning hours when temperatures were at their lowest. Barometric pressure remained relatively stable, suggesting that no significant weather systems were moving through the area during this period. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, but there was a notable increase in wind speed later in the period, which could contribute to changes in weather patterns such as the dispersal of any fog or marine layer. The wind direction shifted throughout the day, but there was a tendency for winds to come from the northwest, which is typical for this region and can bring cooler, ocean-influenced air into the city.
