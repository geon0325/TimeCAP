Over the last 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a slight fluctuation in temperature with a general cooling trend during the early hours, followed by a moderate warming later in the day. Humidity levels peaked at full saturation overnight, potentially indicating the presence of fog or mist, before decreasing towards the evening, suggesting clearer conditions. Air pressure experienced a noticeable drop, which could be associated with a change in weather patterns, such as the approach of a frontal system. Wind speeds remained mostly light and constant throughout the period, which would not have contributed significantly to any rapid weather changes. The wind direction shifted from westerly to southwesterly and back to westerly, which is typical for coastal areas like San Francisco and can influence the local temperature and humidity levels due to oceanic effects.
