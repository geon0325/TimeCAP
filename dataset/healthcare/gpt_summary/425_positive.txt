Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, peaking at 18.27% in week 5 and then demonstrating a gradual decline to 5.81% by week 20. Influenza A has consistently been the predominant strain, with its highest positivity rate at 14.99% in week 5 before decreasing to 3.16% by week 20. However, Influenza B also showed a significant presence, peaking at 6.93% in week 13 and subsequently declining to 2.65% by the end of the period. The observed peak in positive influenza cases, followed by a steady decline, may suggest the passing of the peak influenza season, but the healthcare system must remain vigilant for potential resurgences or new strains. The data indicates a potential easing of the burden on healthcare resources related to influenza, but continuous monitoring is crucial to manage resources effectively and respond to changing trends.
