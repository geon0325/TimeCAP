Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature from the peak values of the day into the cooler nighttime hours, followed by a moderate rebound during the daylight period. Humidity levels have shown variations, with a noticeable increase during the night that correlates with the drop in temperature, suggesting the potential for morning dew or fog formation. Air pressure has seen fluctuations, with a significant increase at one point, which could indicate the passage of a frontal system through the area. Wind speeds have generally been mild to moderate, but there was a period where they increased significantly, which may have contributed to a temporary drop in humidity levels. The prevailing wind direction has been predominantly from the south to south-east, which is typical for Houston and can bring in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, affecting local weather conditions.
