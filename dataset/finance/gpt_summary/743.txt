Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with a general downward trend, closing lower by 0.42% from the starting value, which may indicate a cautious market sentiment. The VIX, which measures market volatility, has fluctuated but ended slightly lower than it started, suggesting that investors' uncertainty has not significantly decreased. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 both reflect a degree of resilience, with the Nikkei 225 showing a slight gain and the FTSE 100 exhibiting a more pronounced upward trend, signaling potential investor confidence in these markets. Gold Futures have remained relatively stable with a slight uptrend, indicating that investors may be looking at gold as a safe haven amidst market fluctuations. The exchange rates for EUR/USD and USD/CNY have shown minimal change, suggesting stability in these currency pairs, while the USD/JPY has appreciated, which could increase the cost of exports for Japan and affect trade balances.
