The analysis of the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data over the last 20 weeks shows a gradual increase in the percentage of ILI patients across all age groups, with the most significant rise observed in the youngest (0-4 years) and the oldest (65 years or more) age brackets. Although the overall number of patients fluctuated, there was a notable surge in the latter weeks, particularly in the number of ILI cases among school-aged children and young adults (5-24 years). The ratio of ILI patients has steadily increased, surpassing the baseline threshold of 2.9% in the most recent week, which signals a potential onset of an influenza outbreak. This trend, if it continues, could place additional strain on healthcare resources, necessitating increased vigilance and possibly the implementation of targeted public health interventions. The healthcare system should be prepared for a higher volume of ILI cases, including ensuring adequate vaccine supplies, antiviral medications, and possibly increasing healthcare workforce capacity to handle the rise in patient volume.
