The analysis of the last 20 weeks of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data reveals a gradual increase in the percentage of patients presenting with ILI symptoms across all age groups. This upward trend is consistent and shows a significant rise in the ratio of ILI patients, which has moved from well below the baseline to considerably above it, indicating a growing healthcare concern. The most notable increases in ILI cases have been observed in the youngest age group (0-4 years) and the 5-24 year age group, which could suggest higher transmission rates or susceptibility in these populations. Although the ratios have surpassed the baseline, they have not yet reached levels typically associated with peak influenza seasons. However, this trend warrants close monitoring and preparedness in the healthcare system for a potential surge in demand for medical services, especially if the trajectory continues to rise or if there is an onset of peak influenza season.
