Over the past 20 weeks, the proportion of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases across all age groups has consistently remained below the 2.9% severity benchmark, with a decreasing trend observed in the ratio of ILI patients, which dropped from an initial 2.41% to a low of 1.19%, before slightly rising to the current level of 1.26%. The highest number of ILI cases was reported in the age group 5-24, followed by 25-49, 0-4, 50-64, and 65 or more, indicating that younger populations were more affected. However, all age groups showed a decrease in the number of ILI cases over the 20-week period, suggesting a general decline in ILI activity. Despite the downward trend, the healthcare system must remain vigilant, as ILI can place a significant burden on resources, particularly if there is a sudden increase or if the trend reverses. The current low ILI activity could allow healthcare systems to allocate resources to other pressing health concerns or to prepare for potential future increases in ILI cases.
