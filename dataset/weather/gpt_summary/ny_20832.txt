Over the last 24 hours, New York City experienced a gradual increase in temperature, which later saw a sharp decrease, indicating a potentially fast-moving weather system passing through the area. Humidity levels peaked at saturation for several hours, suggesting the possibility of fog or precipitation during that time. Air pressure experienced significant variation, with a notable increase followed by a sharp decrease and then partial recovery, which could be indicative of changing weather patterns, such as the approach and passage of a frontal system. Wind speeds remained light throughout the period, with a brief increase, but overall would have had a minimal impact on conditions. Wind direction showed variability, shifting from predominantly westerly to easterly and then northerly directions, which may have influenced the temperature fluctuations and humidity levels observed in the city.
