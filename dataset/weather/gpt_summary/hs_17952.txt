Over the past 24 hours in Houston, we've observed a gradual increase in temperature that peaked during the later hours of the day, indicating a typical diurnal warming pattern. Humidity levels showed a general decline as temperatures rose, which is consistent with the inverse relationship between temperature and relative humidity. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable with only minor fluctuations, suggesting a period of settled weather without any significant frontal systems impacting the area. Wind speeds were consistently light throughout the day, with no significant gusts or variations. The wind direction was predominantly from the east to northeast, which is common for Houston and could influence the humidity levels as it potentially brings moisture from the Gulf of Mexico.
