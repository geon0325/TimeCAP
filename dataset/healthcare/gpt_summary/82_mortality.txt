Over the last 20 weeks, there has been an upward trend in the mortality ratio of Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, starting at 5.26% and increasing to 6.84%, which is higher than the average ratio of 7.84%. The total number of deaths fluctuated but showed an overall increase from 50,637 to 57,370. Deaths attributed to influenza saw a significant rise in the latter part of the 20-week period, escalating from 4 to 165. Pneumonia-related deaths also increased, starting at 2,661 and rising to 3,759 by week 20. The increasing trend in the ratio of mortality due to these respiratory conditions, particularly in the context of an overall rise in the number of deaths, suggests a growing impact on the healthcare system that may require enhanced public health interventions and resource allocation.
