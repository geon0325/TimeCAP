Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a gradual decline in temperature from the earlier hours, reaching a minimum before rising again towards the later hours, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly throughout the period, with notable peaks suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air at times, which could have led to a feeling of mugginess or the potential for fog, especially when the temperature was lower. Air pressure remained relatively stable for most of the day but showed a sudden drop at one point, which could be associated with a transient weather system passing through the area. Wind speeds varied, with some hours experiencing brisk conditions, while later hours saw calmer winds, which may have contributed to variable wind chill effects on perceived temperature. Wind direction was predominantly westerly, with brief shifts including a period of calm winds, suggesting the influence of local topography and coastal effects on the wind patterns observed in San Francisco.
