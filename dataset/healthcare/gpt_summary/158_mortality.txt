Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in the mortality rate from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths. Initially below the 20-week average of 7.84%, the ratio increased steadily, reaching a peak of 15.78% in week 13, indicating a significant rise in deaths due to these respiratory conditions. This peak coincides with a substantial increase in the total number of deaths, suggesting a possible outbreak or seasonal surge. Following the peak, there has been a consistent decline in both the absolute number of deaths from Influenza or Pneumonia and their ratio to total deaths, dropping to 8.86% by week 20. This trend of declining mortality rates may indicate a subsiding of the outbreak or an effective response from the healthcare system, but the need for continued vigilance remains given the historical volatility in these figures.
