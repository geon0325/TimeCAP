Over the past 24 hours in New York City, there has been a gradual decrease in temperature, indicative of a cooling trend. Humidity levels remained at saturation for the majority of the time, suggesting a high likelihood of fog or precipitation. Air pressure has been consistently rising, which is typically associated with the onset of more stable weather conditions and possibly clearer skies in the near future. Wind speeds varied but were mostly gentle to moderate, and there was a slight shift in wind direction towards the end of the period, moving from a predominantly northwesterly direction to a northeasterly one. The combination of high humidity, cooling temperatures, and rising air pressure points towards a potential clearing of skies but also suggests that cooler and possibly damp conditions may persist.
