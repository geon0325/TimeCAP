Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 exhibited a slight downtrend, dropping from 4229.45 to 4166.82, indicating potential caution in the equity market. The VIX, commonly known as the "fear gauge," reflected this uncertainty, fluctuating but ending nearly unchanged at 19.75 compared to the initial 19.78, suggesting that market volatility has been relatively stable. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 both showed declines, pointing to a broader global market retreat, with Nikkei 225 falling from 31237.94 to 30696.96 and FTSE 100 from 7470.20 to 7327.40. Gold Futures prices increased from 1824.60 to 1996.20, which is often indicative of investors seeking safe-haven assets during times of market uncertainty. Crude Oil Futures experienced volatility but ended lower at 82.31 from an initial 89.23, which could suggest a bearish outlook for energy demand or a response to broader economic concerns, while relatively stable foreign exchange rates for EUR/USD, USD/JPY, and USD/CNY imply that currency markets have not experienced the same levels of stress as equities and commodities.
