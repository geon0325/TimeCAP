Over the past 20 market days, the S&P 500 has exhibited a downward trend, falling from 4725.79 to 4397.94, signaling potential investor caution and a bearish sentiment. The VIX, commonly known as the "fear index," has increased from 17.96 to 28.85, which reflects growing market volatility and uncertainty among investors. In contrast, the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 showed relative stability with some fluctuations but ended the period slightly lower, indicating mixed performance in international markets. Gold futures saw moderate fluctuations but remained relatively stable, ending the period slightly higher than it began, suggesting a potential flight to safety amid market turbulence. Crude oil futures trended higher, moving from 73.79 to 85.14, which could indicate concerns about inflationary pressures, while major currency pairs such as EUR/USD and USD/JPY have experienced minor fluctuations, pointing towards a period of forex market stability despite the broader market volatility.
