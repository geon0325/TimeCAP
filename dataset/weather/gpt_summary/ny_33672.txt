Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching a peak in the later hours before starting to decrease slightly. Concurrently, humidity levels showed a decreasing trend as temperatures rose, which is a typical diurnal pattern, but there was a notable increase in humidity again towards the end of the period. Air pressure has been on a steady decline throughout the day, suggesting that a low-pressure system could be moving into the area, which might lead to unsettled weather conditions. Wind speeds remained relatively light but showed an increase in the later hours, possibly as a response to the changing pressure conditions. The wind direction was predominantly from the south, shifting more westerly for a period, before returning to a southerly direction, which could have contributed to the warmer temperatures experienced.
