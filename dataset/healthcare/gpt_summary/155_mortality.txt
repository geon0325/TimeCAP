Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable increase in the proportion of deaths attributed to influenza or pneumonia, surpassing the average ratio of 7.84%. The ratio of mortality from these causes to total deaths started at 6.74% and exhibited an upward trend, peaking at 15.78% in the 16th week before declining to 11.80% by the 20th week. The absolute number of deaths from influenza or pneumonia increased significantly during this period, with pneumonia deaths rising from 3636 to a high of 11988, before decreasing to 7825. This peak corresponds with a spike in the total number of deaths, suggesting a potential outbreak or seasonal fluctuation. The healthcare system may have been under increased strain during this period, particularly when the ratio of mortality from these illnesses was at its highest, indicating a need for focused medical response and resource allocation for treatment and prevention.
