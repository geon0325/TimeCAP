Over the past 24 hours in New York City, temperatures have shown slight fluctuations but generally maintained a steady warmth. Humidity levels experienced significant variation, reaching saturation at one point, which could have led to fog or mist, particularly during the cooler early morning hours. Air pressure remained relatively stable, indicating a period of consistent weather patterns without the immediate onset of significant weather changes. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with a notable drop to calm conditions during the late hours, which may have contributed to a build-up of urban pollutants or an increase in temperature due to the lack of mixing in the atmosphere. The wind direction was predominantly from the south, shifting to westerly and then displaying variability towards the end of the period, which could signal a change in weather systems approaching the area.
