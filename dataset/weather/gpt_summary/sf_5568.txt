Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures showed a typical diurnal pattern with a peak during the day followed by a gradual decrease overnight into the early morning hours. Humidity levels fluctuated but were generally high, especially during the late night and early morning, which could lead to a feeling of mugginess or the presence of morning fog. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period with a slight increase towards the end, indicating steady weather conditions without the immediate approach of any significant weather systems. Wind speeds varied, with a notable increase during the day that may have contributed to a brisk and cooler feel, especially when coupled with the higher wind speeds in the later hours. Wind direction was variable but predominantly northerly, occasionally shifting to other directions, which is typical for coastal cities like San Francisco where ocean breezes can influence wind patterns.
