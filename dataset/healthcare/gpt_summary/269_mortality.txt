Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable decline in the mortality rate from Influenza or Pneumonia when compared to the total number of deaths, starting at 9.59% and ending at 6.18%, with the average over the period being 6.47%, which is below the historical average of 7.84%. Despite fluctuations in the total number of deaths, the number of deaths attributed to Influenza has decreased significantly from 62 to 17, indicating a possible reduction in Influenza incidence or mortality. Conversely, deaths from pneumonia have shown a variable trend but ended almost flat, suggesting a persistent impact on overall mortality. The highest ratio of Influenza or Pneumonia mortality to total deaths within this period was in the first week at 9.59%, which then showed a general downward trend. This data implies a potential easing of the burden of these respiratory conditions on the healthcare system, although continuous monitoring is necessary since pneumonia remains a significant contributor to mortality.
