Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable decline in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with an overall average positivity rate of 6.26%, yet the most recent data shows a positivity rate below this average at 1.90%. The number of specimens tested has fluctuated, reaching a peak at the beginning of the period and then decreasing, possibly indicating a seasonal trend or a response to reduced influenza activity. Influenza B has consistently been more prevalent than Influenza A, as evidenced by a higher percentage of positive specimens; however, both subtypes show a decreasing trend in positivity rates. The current low positivity rates for both influenza A and B suggest a downward trend in influenza activity, which may lead to a lesser burden on healthcare resources for influenza cases. However, vigilance is necessary as even small percentage increases in influenza positivity rates can translate into a significant number of cases due to the high volume of testing.
