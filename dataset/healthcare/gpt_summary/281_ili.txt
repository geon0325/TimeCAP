Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a steady increase in the number of patients presenting with Influenza-like Illness (ILI), with the largest upticks observed in the youngest (0-4 years) and older (25-49 and 50-64 years) age groups. Despite the rise in ILI cases, the ratio of ILI patients has remained below the baseline level of concern, suggesting that while ILI is prevalent, it's not reaching epidemic proportions. The age distribution of ILI cases indicates a higher susceptibility or possibly higher exposure rates among children and middle-aged adults, which could have implications for targeted public health interventions. The healthcare system may experience increased demand for pediatric and adult medical care due to this pattern of ILI presentations. However, the overall ILI ratio remaining below the threshold suggests that the current healthcare infrastructure is likely to be able to manage the situation without being overwhelmed.
