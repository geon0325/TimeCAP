Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a noticeable decrease in temperature, transitioning from warmer conditions to a cooler environment as the day progressed into night. Humidity levels varied significantly, with a notable peak suggesting the potential for fog formation, especially during early morning hours when humidity reached saturation. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight fluctuation that indicates steady weather patterns without the immediate approach of significant weather systems. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with occasional gusts that could have affected localized temperature perception, possibly creating cooler wind chill effects. The predominant wind direction shifted throughout the day, ranging from northwesterly to southerly flows, which may have influenced coastal conditions and impacted maritime activities.
