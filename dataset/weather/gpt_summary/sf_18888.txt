Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have experienced slight fluctuations with a general cooling trend towards the early hours, followed by a moderate rise in the later hours. Humidity levels have been very high, reaching saturation at certain points, which could indicate the presence of fog or mist, especially during the nighttime and early morning when temperatures were at their lowest. Atmospheric pressure has shown a gradual decreasing trend, suggesting a possibility of changing weather patterns, such as the potential for incoming weather systems. Wind speeds remained mostly light to gentle, with some increase in strength in the later hours, and wind direction varied significantly, indicating variable and possibly unsettled wind patterns. The combination of high humidity, decreasing pressure, and variable winds may lead to cloudier skies and a higher likelihood of precipitation in the near future.
