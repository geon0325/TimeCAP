Over the last 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have exhibited a typical diurnal pattern with the warmest conditions occurring in the late afternoon and cooler temperatures during the early morning hours. Relative humidity levels have generally increased during the night, which is common as temperatures drop, and have decreased during the day with rising temperatures, suggesting a stable pattern of daily moisture variation. Air pressure remained relatively steady with a slight dip and subsequent rise, indicating stable weather conditions without significant frontal activity. Wind speeds were consistently light, with minimal fluctuations throughout the period, which would have likely contributed to a calmer weather pattern with less wind-related impact. Wind direction varied between south and north-northwest, suggesting the presence of shifting air masses, though without extreme changes in direction that would indicate the passage of a strong weather front.
