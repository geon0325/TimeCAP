Over the past 20 weeks, the data indicates a fluctuating trend in the ratio of mortality due to Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, with the ratio starting at 8.37% and ending at 6.42%, peaking at 9.15% in the fifth week. Despite some weekly variability, there has been a general decline in the number of deaths attributed to Influenza or Pneumonia, with the number of deaths from influenza decreasing from 851 to 155 and from pneumonia decreasing from 4654 to 3012. The total number of deaths has also shown a downward trend over the 20 weeks, with an initial count of 65760 decreasing to 49354 by the end of the period. The highest deviation from the average mortality ratio of 7.84% occurred in the third week at 9.03%, suggesting an elevated impact of Influenza or Pneumonia during that time. These trends suggest a decrease in the overall burden of Influenza and Pneumonia on the healthcare system but also emphasize the need for continued monitoring and preparedness for potential fluctuations in disease impact.
