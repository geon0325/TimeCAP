Over the last 24 hours in New York City, temperatures have experienced a mild fluctuation, with a general downward trend towards the latter part of the period, indicating a slight cooling off as the day progressed into night. Humidity levels showed variability but remained generally above the halfway mark, suggesting a relatively moist air mass present over the area. Air pressure has been on a steady increase throughout the period, which typically signals settling weather and could imply a likelihood of continued fair conditions. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate and increased towards the current hour, which could contribute to a wind chill effect, making it feel cooler than the actual temperature. The wind direction varied significantly, indicating changing weather patterns, but there was a notable shift towards northerly winds in the most recent hours, which is often associated with cooler air being drawn down from higher latitudes.
