Over the last 20 weeks, the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data reveals a fluctuating but overall decreasing trend in the number of patients presenting with ILI symptoms across all age groups. Significantly, the ratio of ILI patients has consistently remained below the baseline of 2.9%, suggesting a relatively mild influenza season thus far. However, there has been a slight uptick in the ratio of ILI patients towards the end of the observed period, indicating a potential increase in influenza activity. The youngest age group (0-4 years) continues to report the highest number of ILI cases compared to other age groups, which may require focused pediatric healthcare resources. Despite the increase, the healthcare system is not currently strained by ILI cases, but vigilance is necessary to monitor for any signs of a significant uptick that could alter this status.
