Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, culminating in a significant peak towards the end of the period. Humidity levels showed a decreasing trend as temperatures rose, which is typical as warmer air can hold more moisture before it reaches saturation. Air pressure readings varied, with a notable increase mid-period, which could be associated with the transient influence of a high-pressure system, but ended with a decrease that might signal an approaching weather front. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with a slight increase in velocity towards the end of the period, possibly indicating the influence of the aforementioned changes in pressure. The wind direction remained fairly consistent, with a slight shift from southerly to more southeasterly directions, which in Houston could suggest the movement of sea breeze from the Gulf of Mexico inland.
