Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a declining trend, dropping approximately 3.66%, which indicates a bearish mood among investors and suggests a potential increase in market caution. The VIX, which measures market volatility, has risen by 31.54% in the same period, reflecting growing investor uncertainty and risk aversion. Notably, the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 have also seen decreases of 2.10% and 4.61% respectively, pointing to a broader global market retreat. Conversely, while Gold Futures have declined by 4.08%, indicating a possible shift in safe-haven asset preferences, Crude Oil Futures have experienced volatility but ended slightly higher by 4.3%, which could imply concerns over supply or geopolitical tensions affecting oil prices. Exchange rates show the US dollar strengthening against the Japanese yen by 4.63%, and against the Chinese yuan by 1.67%, which could impact export competitiveness and international trade balances.
