Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with a general downward trend, declining from 4514.07 to 4345.72, which may indicate increasing investor caution or response to market uncertainties. The VIX, which measures market volatility, peaked at 25.71 and ended the period slightly elevated at 21.30, confirming the increased market volatility. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 also experienced downward movements, with the Nikkei 225 notably dropping from 30181.21 to 27822.12, a potential sign of investor pessimism or economic concerns in the Asia-Pacific region. Gold futures saw minor fluctuations but ended slightly lower, suggesting that investors may not be substantially turning to traditional safe havens. Lastly, crude oil futures rose from 69.30 to 78.93, while currency exchange rates remained relatively stable, with minor weakening in EUR/USD and USD/JPY, which could indicate ongoing commodity strength amidst a relatively stable currency market.
