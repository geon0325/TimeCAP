Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, with a slight rebound during the daytime hours, indicative of typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels fluctuated moderately, increasing during the cooler morning hours and decreasing slightly with the rise in temperatures, which is consistent with the inverse relationship between temperature and relative humidity. Air pressure has been slowly decreasing after a period of relative stability, suggesting a possible change in weather conditions, such as an approaching weather system. The wind speed varied moderately, with occasional increases that could have contributed to a wind chill effect, making it feel colder than the actual temperature. Wind directions were predominantly from the southeast, shifting occasionally, which may have influenced coastal weather conditions and temperature regulation within the urban environment.
