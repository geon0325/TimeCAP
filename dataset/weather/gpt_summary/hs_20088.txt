Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have experienced a moderate fluctuation, initially decreasing before gradually rising to peak in the late afternoon and then slightly tapering off. Humidity levels have shown a general decline through the period, indicative of drier air moving into the area. Air pressure has been on a subtle but consistent downward trend, suggesting a gradual change in the atmospheric conditions that could potentially lead to evolving weather patterns. Wind speed remained relatively light to gentle throughout the day, with a slight increase observed later on, which may influence the dispersal of any present air mass. The wind direction has generally shifted from southeasterly to more southwesterly over the course of the day, which could be associated with the transport of warmer air and possibly a shift in weather conditions.
