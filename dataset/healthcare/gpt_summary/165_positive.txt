Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable upward trend in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, peaking at 26.24% in week 12 before gradually declining. The prevalence of Influenza A significantly outweighs that of Influenza B, with its peak positivity ratio reaching 25.36% compared to Influenza B's peak at 1.85%. Despite the recent decrease in the overall positivity ratio, the percentage of Influenza B cases has risen, suggesting a shift in the circulating strains of the virus. The highest volume of positive cases occurred during weeks 10 through 12, potentially straining healthcare resources due to the increased demand for medical care and antiviral medication. As the overall positivity rate now trends downward to 8.61%, continued surveillance is necessary to monitor for potential changes in virus transmission and to guide public health interventions.
