Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a downward trend, declining from 4071.70 to 3839.50, signaling investor caution and potential concerns over economic conditions. The VIX, commonly known as the fear gauge, has fluctuated but remained elevated with a slight increase from 19.06 to 21.67, indicating lingering market volatility and uncertainty. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 have also experienced declines, suggesting a broader global market retreat, with the Nikkei 225 dropping from 27777.90 to 26094.50 and the FTSE 100 from 7556.20 to 7451.70. Gold Futures have remained relatively stable with slight upwards movement from 1795.90 to 1819.70, possibly reflecting its status as a safe haven during times of market stress. The stability in the EUR/USD exchange rate, hovering around 1.05 to 1.07, and the slight depreciation of the USD against the JPY and CNY could indicate a cautious stance towards the USD amidst global economic uncertainties.
