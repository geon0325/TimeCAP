Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before slightly cooling towards the evening. Humidity levels showed significant variation, with a notable increase during the early morning hours, indicative of possible morning fog or mist, before fluctuating and settling at moderately high levels towards the night. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout most of the day, with a slight decrease later on, which could suggest the approach of a weather system that might bring changes in the coming days. Wind speeds were predominantly moderate, with a significant decrease in the early morning, potentially contributing to the higher humidity and fog development around that time. The wind direction was primarily westerly, with some variations to northerly and easterly directions, which is typical for the region's oceanic influence on weather patterns.
