Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced relatively stable temperatures with a slight warming trend observed towards the latter part of the day. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, reaching saturation at certain hours, which could have led to fog or mist conditions, particularly when the temperature was cooler. Air pressure remained mostly steady, showing a slight but consistent increase throughout the day, which may suggest stable weather conditions are prevailing. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a noticeable increase during the day, which could have contributed to temporary relief from humidity. The wind direction varied, with a tendency to shift from northerly to easterly, which is typical for Houston's coastal location and could influence local weather patterns such as sea breezes.
