Over the last 20 weeks, the incidence of influenza-like illness (ILI) has remained below the severity benchmark of 2.9% in all age groups. The highest proportion of ILI cases was observed in the 0-4 age group, reaching a peak in week 6, and the 5-24 age group, which peaked during week 4, indicating that these populations are currently the most affected. Although there was an overall upward trend in ILI cases in the early weeks, the ratio of ILI patients has decreased since week 7, with the most recent weeks showing a modest rebound. The older age groups (50-64 and 65 or more) have consistently exhibited lower ILI rates compared to younger age groups throughout the period. The data suggests that while the ILI rates are below the threshold for high severity, continuous monitoring is essential, particularly for the youngest patients who are showing higher rates of ILI.
