Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a slight upward trend, closing marginally higher at 2930.19 from an initial figure of 2846.06, despite experiencing volatility within the period. The VIX, which measures market volatility, has generally decreased from 37.76 to 27.57, indicating that investor fear has subsided somewhat, correlating with the slight recovery in equity markets. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 indices have similarly reflected a modest uptrend, ending at 20390.66 and 5939.70 respectively, suggesting a cautious optimism in global equity markets. Gold futures, typically a safe-haven asset, have seen a decrease from 1756.70 to 1695.30, which could suggest a shift in investor sentiment toward riskier assets as markets stabilize. Crude oil futures have recovered from unprecedented negative pricing to stabilize around the mid-$20 range, while key currency pairs such as EUR/USD and USD/JPY have remained relatively stable, indicating that forex markets are not experiencing severe stress despite global economic uncertainty.
