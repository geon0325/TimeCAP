Humidity levels varied significantly, starting with moderate values in the morning, dropping to lower levels during the day which indicates drier conditions, and then spiking drastically in the final hour, suggesting the development of a more moist air mass. Air pressure showed a general decreasing trend through the day, ending with a sharp drop, which could be indicative of an approaching weather system that might affect the area. Wind speeds were strong in the early hours but saw a general decrease throughout the day, becoming quite calm by the evening, which might have contributed to a more stable atmosphere until the spike in humidity.
