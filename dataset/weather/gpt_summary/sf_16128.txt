Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperature experienced a notable increasing trend, suggesting a warming pattern after an initial drop. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with periods of high humidity giving way to much dryer conditions later in the day, which could have implications for comfort levels and may increase the need for hydration among residents and visitors. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, indicating a steady-state atmospheric condition with no immediate signs of significant weather systems moving in. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate with some variability, but without strong gusts, which should not pose any immediate concerns for outdoor activities. Lastly, the wind direction shifted throughout the day, including a period of easterly winds, which is less typical for the region and could have influenced local weather patterns, such as the distribution of marine air.
