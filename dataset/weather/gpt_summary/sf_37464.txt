Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperature has remained relatively stable, with minor fluctuations indicating a steady weather pattern. Humidity levels have experienced significant variation, with notable peaks suggesting the potential for fog formation, especially during times of higher humidity coupled with cooler temperatures. Air pressure has seen a downward trend, which could be indicative of an approaching weather system that may lead to changes in the current conditions. Wind speeds have been mostly moderate but showed a couple of spikes, which, combined with shifting wind directions, could contribute to brisk conditions and influence the dispersal of any marine layer or fog present. Overall, the combination of these weather indicators suggests a generally stable weather pattern with the potential for intermittent fog and slight variability in wind conditions.
