Over the last 20 weeks, the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) rates have consistently surpassed the benchmark severity level of 2.9% of total patient count, indicating a widespread and persistent flu season. The highest ILI patient ratio was observed in the third week at 7.37%, followed by a gradual decline, yet it remained well above the severity threshold until the 16th week. Notably, the pediatric age group (0-4 years) and school-age group (5-24 years) had the highest number of ILI cases throughout the period, which could suggest a higher transmission rate among children and young adults. Although there has been a slow decrease in ILI percentages after peaking, the patient counts for older age groups (50-64 and 65 or more) show less fluctuation, indicating sustained vulnerability in these populations. The consistent exceedance of the severity benchmark for such an extended period suggests a significant burden on healthcare resources, emphasizing the need for continued vigilance and possibly increased influenza vaccination and prevention efforts.
