Over the past 24 hours in New York City, temperatures observed a noticeable increase during the afternoon hours before declining towards the late evening, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels have been steadily high, especially towards the end of the observed period, which could contribute to a perception of chilliness or dampness in the air. Air pressure has shown slight fluctuations but remained relatively stable, suggesting a period of steady weather conditions without significant frontal activity. Wind speeds have been mostly light to moderate, which is not unusual for the region, with a noticeable shift in wind direction from primarily southwesterly to northerly, possibly indicating the passage of a weather front. Given the high humidity and the shift in wind direction, there could be an increased likelihood of precipitation or fog development in the following hours.
