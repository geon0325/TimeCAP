The analysis of the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data over the last 20 weeks reveals a significant increase in the ratio of ILI patients, surpassing the baseline of 2.9% early in the time series and peaking at more than double the baseline in subsequent weeks. Notably, the age group 0-4 has seen a substantial rise in ILI cases, indicating a higher vulnerability or transmission rate among young children. The age group 5-24 also experienced a marked increase, which might be attributed to school-based transmission and social interactions. The consistent elevation of ILI rates above the baseline across all age groups suggests a strain on healthcare resources, with potential implications for increased hospital visits, a need for greater clinical attention, and a possible impact on workplace attendance due to illness. This trend calls for public health interventions to manage the spread and mitigate the impact on the healthcare system, including vaccination drives, public awareness campaigns, and enhanced surveillance.
