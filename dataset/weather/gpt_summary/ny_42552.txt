Humidity levels fluctuated moderately but have been showing an upward trend towards the end of the period, potentially indicating increased moisture in the air which could lead to a higher chance of precipitation or fog formation. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable, with only minor fluctuations, suggesting that no significant weather fronts were passing through the area during the observed time. Wind speeds were consistently light and showed a slight increase towards the latter part of the day, while wind directions varied greatly, indicating the absence of a dominant weather system influencing the wind pattern.
