Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a slight decrease in temperature, showing a trend towards cooler conditions, particularly noticeable during the latter hours of the time series. Humidity levels started relatively high but gradually decreased, indicating drier air moving into the area. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting a steady atmospheric condition without significant weather fronts moving through. Wind speeds varied, with periods of higher intensity, which may have contributed to the decrease in humidity by dispersing moisture in the air. The wind direction shifted predominantly from southerly to westerly directions throughout the day, which is characteristic of changing weather patterns that could influence future temperature and humidity levels.
