Over the past 24 hours in New York City, temperatures have experienced a moderate fluctuation, starting off relatively warm, dipping in the early hours, and then gradually increasing towards the end of the period. Humidity levels have shown a decreasing trend, starting high but slowly descending, indicating drier air moving into the area. Atmospheric pressure has been on a steady rise throughout the period, suggesting a strengthening high-pressure system that is likely to bring stable and clearer weather conditions. Wind speeds have remained fairly constant and light, with only slight variations, which would not have contributed significantly to changes in the perceived temperature. Finally, the wind direction has been predominantly from the northwest, consistent with the cooler and drier air associated with the observed high-pressure system.
