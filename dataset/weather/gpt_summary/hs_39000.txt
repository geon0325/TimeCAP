Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature with a general trend of cooling overnight and a subsequent warming trend during the day. Humidity levels experienced significant variability, reaching full saturation at times, which suggests the possibility of fog or dew formation, especially during the early hours when temperatures were at their lowest. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight increase observed, indicating steady weather conditions and the absence of any immediate, significant weather fronts or systems. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, and while there was some variability, there were no indications of strong or gusty winds that could impact activities. The wind direction shifted throughout the day, with a notable change from southerly to more easterly and northeasterly directions, which could influence local temperature and moisture transport.
