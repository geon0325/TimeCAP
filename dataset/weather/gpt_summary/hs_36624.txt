Over the last 24 hours in Houston, there has been a gradual increase in temperature, peaking during the afternoon hours, which is typical for the region's diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels started very high but saw a significant decrease later in the day, suggesting a change in air mass or the influence of daytime heating leading to lower relative humidity. Atmospheric pressure has been slowly rising, indicating a potential trend towards more stable weather conditions. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with some variability in intensity but not significant enough to suggest severe weather conditions. The wind direction has primarily fluctuated between southwesterly and northwesterly, with a tendency to shift more towards the north by the end of the period, which may be associated with the passage of a frontal system or a change in the local pressure gradient.
