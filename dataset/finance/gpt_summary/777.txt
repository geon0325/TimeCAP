Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a downward trend, decreasing from 4546.54 to 4306.26, signaling a potential increase in market uncertainty or bearish sentiment. The VIX, also known as the Fear Index, has risen from 21.96 to 33.32, reflecting heightened market volatility and investor nervousness. International markets have echoed this sentiment, with Japan's Nikkei 225 and the UK's FTSE 100 both experiencing declines, suggesting a global apprehension among investors. In contrast, safe-haven assets like Gold Futures have seen an uptick in price from 1800.30 to 1942.40, indicating a flight to safety amidst market turmoil. The exchange rates for the EUR/USD and USD/JPY have remained relatively stable with slight depreciation of the USD, while the USD/CNY has shown a modest strengthening of the USD against the CNY, which could indicate a move towards the dollar in search of stability.
