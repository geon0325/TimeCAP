Over the last 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have shown a gradual decrease through the early hours, reaching the lowest point during the night, followed by a steady climb back up during the day. Humidity levels varied significantly, with peaks coinciding with the lowest temperatures, suggesting possible early morning fog or higher moisture content in the air during cooler times. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a notable spike and subsequent normalization, which could have been associated with transient weather events that might not have a long-lasting impact on the overall weather pattern. Wind speeds have generally increased over the period, with the strongest winds occurring in the most recent hours, indicating that conditions may be becoming windier. The predominant wind direction was from the west to the northwest, which is common for coastal San Francisco and can bring in marine air, influencing both temperature and humidity levels in the region.
