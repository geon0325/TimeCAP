Over the past 24 hours in New York City, there has been a gradual increase in temperature, transitioning from below freezing to slightly milder conditions. Humidity levels have shown variability but generally trended upward, indicating increased moisture in the air that could lead to a higher likelihood of precipitation or fog. Air pressure experienced a slight decrease initially but then rose significantly towards the end of the period, suggesting the potential for improving weather conditions or the arrival of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with an increase later in the period, which could contribute to wind chill effects despite the rise in temperature. The predominant wind direction was from the southwest, shifting slightly towards the west-northwest, which is typical for cold fronts passing through the area.
