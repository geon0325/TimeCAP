Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, with a marked peak occurring between the 10th and 11th weeks where the ratio surged to approximately 19.38%, significantly higher than the average of 7.84%. This spike coincides with a dramatic increase in total deaths, suggesting a possible outbreak or an acute healthcare event during that period. After this peak, there has been a consistent decline in both the number and ratio of deaths attributable to Influenza or Pneumonia, with the ratio decreasing from 19.40% in week 11 to 8.82% by week 20. The number of deaths from Influenza has decreased over the period, reaching a low in week 20 with only 6 deaths, indicating a potential reduction in Influenza transmission or improved control measures. The overall trend suggests a gradual return towards average mortality levels from these respiratory conditions, yet the healthcare system may still be burdened by the high volume of pneumonia cases, which continue to account for a significant proportion of total deaths.
