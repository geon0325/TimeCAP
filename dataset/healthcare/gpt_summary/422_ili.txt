Over the past 20 weeks, the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) incidence has shown a declining trend, with the initial proportion of ILI cases at 2.70% and gradually decreasing to 1.44% by the end of the period, staying below the 2.9% threshold throughout. This decrease is consistent across all age groups, with the total number of ILI patients decreasing from 56,258 to 28,889 over the 20-week period. The largest absolute decrease in ILI cases was observed in the 5-24 age group, which is often a significant vector for disease spread due to school and social activities. Despite the overall decline in ILI rates, the healthcare system should remain vigilant, particularly in the 0-4 age group, which consistently reported the highest number of ILI cases compared to other age groups. Given the downward trend and current rates well below the benchmark severity level, the data suggests a relatively mild influenza season, but continuous monitoring is necessary to promptly address any potential outbreaks or shifts in trends.
