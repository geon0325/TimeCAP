Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable decline in both the number and ratio of positive specimens for Influenza A and B, indicating a downward trend in influenza activity. The initial high of 23.65% positive specimens has steadily decreased to just 0.87% in the most recent week, with the number of specimens tested also decreasing over time. The proportion of Influenza A positives has decreased more significantly compared to Influenza B, as evidenced by the latest ratios of 0.38% for Influenza A and 0.49% for Influenza B. This trend suggests an easing of the burden on healthcare resources related to influenza. However, continued monitoring is essential as seasonal variations and other factors could influence future influenza activity.
