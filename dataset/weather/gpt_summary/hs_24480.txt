Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, peaking during the late afternoon before a slight drop towards the evening. Concurrently, humidity levels showed a significant decrease from being very high, indicating a potential clearing of earlier moisture-laden conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a minor fluctuation mid-day, which could be associated with transient weather systems passing through the area. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with a notable decrease in the early morning hours, possibly leading to a more stagnant air mass and contributing to the high humidity observed. Wind direction varied but predominantly came from the south to south-east, which is typical for this region and may have contributed to the warmer temperatures observed due to warm air advection.
