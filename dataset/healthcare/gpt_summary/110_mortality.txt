Over the last 20 weeks, the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia to the total number of deaths has shown a general decreasing trend, starting above the 20-week average at 7.84% and ending below it at 5.58%. This trend suggests a relative decrease in deaths attributable to these respiratory conditions compared to all-cause mortality. The total number of deaths has fluctuated slightly but remained relatively stable, with a slight decrease from 57,988 to 52,186. Notably, there has been a significant decrease in deaths from influenza, which dropped from 483 to 15. Despite a slight uptick in the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia in the penultimate week, the overall trend points to a possible reduction in the impact of these respiratory diseases on the healthcare system's mortality burden over the analyzed period.
