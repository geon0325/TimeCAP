Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable increase in Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases across all age groups, with a significant surge in the latter weeks. The ratio of ILI patients has risen steadily, starting below the benchmark of 2.9% but surpassing it in the 18th week with a peak of 5.55% in the final week, indicating a substantial uptick in influenza activity. The most pronounced increase in ILI cases was observed in the 5-24 age group, followed by the 0-4 and 25-49 age groups, suggesting that younger populations are currently the most affected. This recent escalation in ILI cases is likely to put additional strain on healthcare resources due to a higher demand for medical attention and potential hospitalizations. Public health agencies may need to consider bolstering influenza prevention strategies and ensuring the healthcare system is adequately prepared to manage the increasing number of ILI cases.
