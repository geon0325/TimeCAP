Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a consistent upward trend, increasing from 2886.98 to 3013.77, indicative of investor confidence and a bullish stock market. The VIX, which measures market volatility, has generally decreased from 15.28 to 12.39, suggesting that investors are experiencing less anxiety and the market is stabilizing. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 indices have also demonstrated an upward trajectory, which could signal strengthening in international markets, though the FTSE 100 has shown a slight decrease in recent days. Commodity prices such as Gold and Crude Oil Futures have fluctuated, with Gold showing a significant spike mid-period before stabilizing, and Crude Oil Futures rising overall, potentially reflecting geopolitical tensions and market speculations. The foreign exchange rates have remained relatively stable, with minor fluctuations in EUR/USD and USD/JPY, whereas the USD/CNY pair has shown a slight weakening of the USD against the CNY, which could indicate shifts in trade dynamics or currency valuations.
