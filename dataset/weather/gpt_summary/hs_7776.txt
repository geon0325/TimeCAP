Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak during the late afternoon before beginning to decrease slightly towards the evening. Humidity levels showed a reverse trend, starting high in the early morning hours and then dropping significantly as temperatures rose, indicating a typical diurnal pattern. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with only slight fluctuations, suggesting a stable weather pattern without significant frontal activity. Wind speeds were generally light and variable, with some increase during the hottest part of the day, which could have provided some relief from the heat. Wind direction shifted significantly throughout the day, starting from southeasterly, moving to northeasterly, and then veering to a westerly and eventually northwesterly direction, which may have influenced the temperature and humidity changes observed.
