Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a general upward trend, closing higher by approximately 5.75% from the first to the last day, suggesting a positive outlook among investors. During this period, the VIX, or Volatility Index, has marginally decreased from 21.44 to 18.51, indicating a slight reduction in market volatility and potentially increasing investor confidence. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 both showed resilience, with the Nikkei 225 climbing around 5.11% and the FTSE 100 rising by approximately 3.36%, reflecting strength in both Asian and European markets. Gold futures fluctuated but ended slightly higher, suggesting continued investor interest in safe-haven assets amidst ongoing market uncertainties. The exchange rates saw the Euro and the Japanese Yen appreciating against the US Dollar, while the Chinese Yuan remained relatively stable against the Dollar, which may indicate shifting investor sentiment towards the Eurozone and Japan, and a steady outlook on the Chinese economy.
