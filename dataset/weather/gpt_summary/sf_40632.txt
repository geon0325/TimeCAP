Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual decline in temperature followed by a modest recovery, indicative of a typical diurnal pattern with cooler conditions overnight. Humidity levels have shown some fluctuation but remained relatively high, suggesting a noticeable presence of moisture in the air which could contribute to a feeling of mugginess or the potential for fog, particularly during the cooler early morning hours. Air pressure experienced minor variations with a general trend towards lower values, which could be associated with the approach of a weather system that may lead to changing weather conditions in the near term. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with a period of higher speeds that could result in brisk conditions, especially if one is in a wind-exposed area. Wind direction varied significantly throughout the day, which could lead to variable weather patterns, such as shifting fog and changes in temperature felt at the ground level.
