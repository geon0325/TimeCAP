Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before slowly decreasing towards the evening. Humidity levels showed significant variation, with very high humidity in the early morning hours, which could have contributed to morning mist or fog, followed by a marked decrease as the temperature peaked, indicating drier conditions during the day. Air pressure has been relatively stable, with a slight decrease observed, which is typical during warmer periods of the day and should not suggest any immediate, significant change in weather patterns. Wind speeds were mostly moderate, with some increase towards the end of the period, which may help to disperse any built-up pollution or humidity. Wind directions fluctuated, primarily coming from the south and transitioning to northerly winds by the end of the period, which could bring cooler air and affect the local temperature in the following hours.
