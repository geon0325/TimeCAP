The data indicates a peak in influenza activity around week 9 with a positive specimen ratio of 23.65%, followed by a gradual decline to 4.72% by week 20, demonstrating a typical seasonal pattern. Influenza A was the predominant strain throughout the 20 weeks, with its highest positivity rate at 18.16% in week 9, but it showed a steady decline to a low of 1.20% by week 20. In contrast, Influenza B maintained a more stable positivity rate, peaking at 6.29% in week 14 and decreasing to 3.52% by week 20, suggesting it may have a less pronounced seasonal impact. Despite the overall decrease in influenza activity, the healthcare system should remain vigilant as the consistently present Influenza B and the potential for new strains could lead to unexpected surges. The data highlights the importance of ongoing influenza surveillance, vaccination, and public health interventions to mitigate the impact of the virus on the healthcare system.
