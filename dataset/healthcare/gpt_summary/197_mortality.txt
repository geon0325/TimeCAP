Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to total deaths, with a significant peak observed in weeks 11 and 12 at 19.37% and 19.40%, respectively, far exceeding the average ratio of 7.84%. This peak sharply contrasts with the initial weeks where the ratio was below the average, starting at 5.54% and rising marginally. The number of deaths from pneumonia consistently contributed more to the overall mortality than influenza, with pneumonia cases reaching a high of 16,884 in week 12, whereas influenza deaths peaked at 203 in week 11. Following this peak, there has been a steady decline in the ratio of deaths from Influenza or Pneumonia to total deaths, ending at 10.39% in week 20, indicating a gradual return towards the average. This trend suggests a potential episodic outbreak that placed additional strain on healthcare resources during the peak weeks, but a subsequent easing of that pressure as the ratio lowered.
