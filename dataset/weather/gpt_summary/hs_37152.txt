Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a gradual increase in temperature, indicative of warming weather conditions moving through the area. Humidity levels started high, reaching saturation in the early hours, but showed a significant decrease as the day progressed, which is typical as temperatures rise. Air pressure experienced a slight downward trend, suggesting a potential shift in weather patterns, possibly leading to increased cloud cover or a change in weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with some increase noted in the latter part of the period, which could contribute to a dispersal of humidity and influence local temperature feels. The wind direction was variable but predominantly southerly, with shifts toward the south-west later on, which in Houston can often bring in warmer air from the Gulf of Mexico.
