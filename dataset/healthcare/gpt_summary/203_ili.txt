The analysis of the 20-week ILI data reveals that the incidence of influenza-like illness peaked mid-time series, with the highest ratios of ILI patients significantly exceeding the baseline threshold. This peak is particularly pronounced in the age groups 5-24 and 25-49, indicating that these demographics were the most affected during this period. Following the peak, there has been a steady decline in ILI ratios across all age groups, with the latest data showing ratios falling below the baseline, suggesting a decrease in ILI activity. The age group 0-4 consistently reported the highest number of ILI cases, which could indicate a higher susceptibility or greater exposure to ILI in this demographic. The observed trends suggest a strain on the healthcare system during the peak period, with a potential easing of the burden more recently as ILI rates decline.
