Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 exhibited volatility with a downward trend initially, followed by a recovery, closing higher at 3859.11 from an earlier low of 3585.62, suggesting a potential short-term bullish reversal. The VIX, commonly known as the "fear index," has generally decreased from a high of 33.63 to 28.46, indicating that market sentiment may be stabilizing after a period of heightened uncertainty. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 showed resilience, with the Nikkei recovering from a dip to close higher, while the FTSE 100 remained relatively stable, suggesting sustained investor confidence in these markets. Gold futures experienced fluctuations with a slight downward trend, closing at 1652.80, which may signal a reduced appeal for safe-haven assets as markets stabilize. The currency markets saw the USD strengthening against the JPY and CNY, while the EUR/USD pair remained relatively stable, which could indicate a stronger perception of the USD amidst global financial dynamics.
