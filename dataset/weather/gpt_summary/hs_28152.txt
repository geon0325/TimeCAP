Over the last 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have exhibited a diurnal pattern, starting off cooler in the early hours, warming significantly during the day, and cooling again towards the evening. Humidity levels have seen fluctuations, increasing during the early morning hours which is typical due to lower temperatures and then decreasing as temperatures rose, before rising again in the evening. Air pressure has remained relatively stable with a slight uptrend, indicating a period of fair weather and possibly contributing to the clear skies. Wind speeds were mostly light, with a slight increase during the daytime, which might have provided a mild relief from the daytime warmth. The wind direction has been variable, predominantly coming from the north-northeast in the early hours, then shifting to come from the southeast by the end of the period, which could bring in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, affecting local weather conditions.
