Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with a downward trend initially followed by a partial recovery, closing higher at 3902.62 from a low of 3666.77. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, has remained elevated, indicating ongoing investor uncertainty, with a slight decrease in the latest period to 26.08 from a peak of 34.02. International markets have mirrored this instability; the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 experienced declines followed by modest rebounds, although the FTSE 100 has shown a more pronounced recovery in recent days. Gold Futures have declined from 1851.90 to 1737.90, suggesting a move away from safe-haven assets, while Crude Oil Futures have also decreased from 122.11 to 102.73, which could indicate concerns over global demand. Currency exchange rates have seen the USD strengthening against major currencies, with the EUR/USD dropping from 1.07 to 1.02 and the USD/CNY slightly increasing, suggesting a flight to the perceived safety of the US dollar amidst market uncertainties.
