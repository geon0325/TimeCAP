Over the last 24 hours, Houston experienced a moderate fluctuation in temperature, with a general cooling trend observed towards the latter part of the period. Humidity levels showed a significant drop from high to moderate values, suggesting a transition from potentially damp conditions to drier air. Air pressure saw a sharp increase at one point, which then stabilized and maintained a steady state, indicating a possible transient high-pressure system moving through the area. Wind speeds varied, with periods of calmer winds and a few instances of stronger gusts; the wind direction was predominantly from the south earlier in the day, shifting to a northerly direction later on. This combination of changing wind patterns and variations in humidity and temperature could have led to dynamic weather conditions, potentially affecting local atmospheric stability and precipitation patterns.
