Over the past 20 weeks, the data indicates a significant increase in the percentage of patients presenting with Influenza-like Illness (ILI), with the ILI patient ratio consistently exceeding the 2.9% benchmark since week 4 and reaching a peak of 6.90% in week 12. The age groups 0-4 and 5-24 show notable spikes in ILI cases, suggesting high transmission rates among younger populations, which may impact schools and childcare facilities. The age group 25-49, typically part of the active workforce, also experienced a substantial rise in ILI cases, potentially affecting workplace productivity and increasing the demand for healthcare services. Although there is a gradual increase in ILI cases in older populations (ages 50 and above), the numbers are less pronounced compared to younger age groups, which may reflect higher vaccination rates or other preventive measures within these cohorts. The sustained elevation of the ILI patient ratio above the benchmark for a prolonged period indicates a considerable burden on the healthcare system, necessitating continued public health vigilance, resource allocation, and potentially the implementation of targeted interventions to manage the spread of influenza.
