Over the last 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before stabilizing towards the evening. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuation, starting high in the early hours, peaking at full saturation around dawn, and then dropping notably as temperatures rose, suggesting the possibility of morning fog clearing as the day progressed. Air pressure remained relatively stable with slight variations, indicating a period of steady weather without immediate signs of significant frontal movements or storm systems. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate throughout the day, with occasional calm periods, and the wind direction shifted considerably, ranging from easterly to southerly, and finally turning westerly by the end of the period. These conditions are consistent with a typical warm and humid day in Houston, perhaps marked by clearer skies and more comfortable conditions as humidity decreased.
