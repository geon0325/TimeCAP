Over the past 20 weeks, the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) incidence has remained below the threshold of 2.9% of total patients, indicating a moderate ILI activity within the assessed population. The highest ILI ratio reported was 2.67% in week 4, followed by a general declining trend that reached its lowest at 1.53% in week 14. The age group of 0-4 consistently reported the highest number of ILI cases, suggesting a higher vulnerability or a better surveillance in this demographic. Notably, all age groups show a decrease in ILI cases over the time frame, with the oldest age group (65 or more) experiencing the least variation in numbers. The current ILI activity does not signal a significant burden on the healthcare system; however, continuous monitoring is essential to promptly respond to any rising trends, especially in the youngest age group.
