Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a noticeable drop in temperature, transitioning from warmer conditions towards cooler temperatures. Humidity levels have seen significant fluctuations, with a general trend towards higher values, indicating increased moisture in the air which could lead to feelings of mugginess or the potential for precipitation. The air pressure readings have remained relatively stable, with a slight inconsistency that appears to be an anomaly, as the pressure has mostly stayed within a narrow range, suggesting stable weather conditions. Wind speeds have been consistently light, indicating calm weather with no significant gusts or storms. However, there has been variability in wind direction, shifting from westerly to northerly, then moving to easterly and finally settling on a southward flow, which could influence temperature and moisture transport into the area.
