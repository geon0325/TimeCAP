Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperatures with a general warming trend during the daytime hours followed by a mild cooling trend in the evening. Humidity levels varied considerably, showing a tendency to decrease during the day but increasing significantly towards the night, indicating the potential for early morning fog or dew. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight decreasing trend, which could suggest a minor system moving through the area, possibly affecting weather patterns slightly. Wind speeds showed some variability with periods of calmer conditions and a few instances of moderate gusts; these changes in wind speed could influence the dispersal of any precipitation or fog. The wind direction was predominantly from the east to southeast, which is typical for Houston's climate and may contribute to the transport of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico into the region.
