Over the past 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with a general downtrend, closing lower at 3986.37 from an opening of 4164.00, suggesting a cautious or bearish market sentiment. The VIX, which measures market volatility, has fluctuated but remained elevated, ending the period slightly higher at 19.59 compared to the initial 18.66, aligning with the observed volatility in the equity markets. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 have demonstrated resilience relative to the S&P 500, with the Nikkei recovering from a dip to close higher at 28309.16 and the FTSE 100 showing lesser volatility, closing marginally lower at 7919.50 from an opening of 7864.70. Gold Futures have declined from 1871.70 to 1813.90, indicating a shift away from safe-haven assets, while Crude Oil Futures have seen increased volatility but closed only slightly higher at 77.58 from an opening of 77.14, possibly reflecting ongoing concerns about global demand and supply dynamics. Exchange rates have remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, as the EUR/USD pair closed almost unchanged at 1.07, and the USD/CNY pair showed a slight depreciation of the dollar, closing at 6.93 from an opening of 6.79, which could indicate nuanced shifts in currency market perspectives on the dollar's strength.
