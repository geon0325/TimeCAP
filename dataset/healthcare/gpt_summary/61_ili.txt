Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a trend of decreasing Influenza-like Illness (ILI) activity, with the percentage of ILI patients starting above the baseline threshold and progressively declining to well below the baseline by the end of the period. The most significant decrease in ILI cases is observed in the 0-4 and 5-24 age groups, which initially had the highest numbers but showed a notable reduction over time. The age group of 25-49 also experienced a decrease in ILI cases, albeit at a slower rate, while the 50-64 and 65 or more age groups had the least number of ILI cases but maintained a relatively constant, albeit declining, trend throughout the period. The overall downward trend suggests a reduction in the spread or severity of ILI, which could lead to a lesser burden on healthcare resources and potentially indicate the effectiveness of preventative measures. However, the healthcare system should remain vigilant for any signs of resurgence, particularly in the higher-risk age groups, and continue promoting ILI prevention strategies.
