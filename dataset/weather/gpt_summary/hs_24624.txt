Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual rise in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before showing a slight cooling trend towards the evening. Relative humidity levels were variable, with very high humidity during the night and early morning hours, suggesting the possibility of morning fog or dew. Air pressure showed a slow but steady decline, indicating a potential change in the weather pattern or the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds remained generally light to moderate throughout the day, with no significant gusts, and the wind direction shifted predominantly from southerly to westerly in the afternoon, which could signal the passage of a frontal system. Overall, these conditions suggest that Houston's weather has been stable but may be on the cusp of a change due to the drop in pressure and shift in wind direction.
