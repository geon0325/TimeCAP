Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have shown a steady increase, indicative of warming conditions. Humidity levels started high but showed a significant decrease towards the end of the period, suggesting drier air moving into the area. Atmospheric pressure experienced a gradual decline, which could be associated with the approach of a low-pressure system, possibly leading to changing weather conditions. Wind speeds remained relatively moderate throughout the day, with a noticeable period of calm winds, followed by more variable conditions. Notably, the wind direction shifted from predominantly easterly to a southerly and then a northwesterly direction, which could be indicative of a frontal passage through the region.
