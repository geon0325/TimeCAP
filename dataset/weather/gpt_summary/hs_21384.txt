Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have remained relatively stable, with only slight fluctuations indicating consistent weather conditions. Humidity levels have been high, trending towards saturation in the latter part of the day, which could suggest the presence of fog or a higher likelihood of precipitation. Air pressure has been gradually decreasing, which often signals an approaching weather system that could bring changes such as rain or storms. Wind speeds have been moderate without significant variation, while wind direction experienced a notable shift, suggesting a possible change in the weather pattern or the influence of a new weather front. Overall, the combination of high humidity, decreasing air pressure, and the shift in wind direction may indicate an increased chance of precipitation or an incoming weather system in the near future.
