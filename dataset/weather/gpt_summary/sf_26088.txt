Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching peak warmth in the late afternoon before slightly cooling down towards the evening. Humidity levels have seen fluctuations, starting relatively high, decreasing significantly during midday, and later showing a variable trend with periods of higher humidity. Air pressure has generally been stable, although there were some notable variations, with a significant increase during the early morning hours followed by a decrease towards the evening, suggesting the possibility of changing weather patterns. Wind conditions have been mostly light and variable, with a distinct shift from northeasterly directions to more variable directions, including a period of calm winds. This combination of rising temperatures, variable humidity, and changing air pressure could indicate a transition in weather patterns, potentially leading to more dynamic weather conditions in the near future.
