Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a notable drop in temperature, which later reversed with a significant warming trend, reaching its peak in the late afternoon. The humidity levels fluctuated considerably, with a sharp increase during the early hours, which is typical following the cooling of the night, before decreasing again as temperatures rose. Air pressure showed a substantial dip, indicating the possible passage of a weather front, but it then stabilized and remained relatively constant. Wind speeds varied, with some gustier conditions occurring sporadically, while wind direction shifted predominantly from southerly to westerly and back to southerly, suggesting a changing weather pattern. The combination of these factors points to an active weather system affecting Houston, with potential implications for temperature variability and possibly transient windy conditions.
