Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant increase in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the ratio of positive specimens rising from 1.48% to 28.32%. This trend indicates a substantial seasonal surge, peaking at 30.26% in week 18. Influenza A has shown a more pronounced increase in positivity rates compared to Influenza B, peaking at 19.50% compared to 8.83% in the latest week, suggesting a potentially greater impact on healthcare resources due to the higher prevalence of Influenza A cases. Despite this, the latest data shows a slight decrease in the positivity rate for both strains, which could indicate that the peak of the season may have passed. Nevertheless, the healthcare system may continue to experience strain, as the rates of positive specimens remain significantly higher than the 20-week average of 6.26%.
