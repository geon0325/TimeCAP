Over the past 20 weeks, the data indicates a significant increase in the number of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the total ratio of positive specimens rising from 0.62% to 25.55%. Influenza A has been the predominant strain, with its ratio of positive specimens escalating sharply from 0.56% to 25.46%, suggesting a widespread outbreak that could strain healthcare resources due to increased patient loads. In contrast, Influenza B has maintained a relatively low and stable presence, with its positive specimen ratio only slightly fluctuating between 0.05% and 0.13%. The highest weekly increase in positive test ratios occurred between weeks 18 and 19, where the rate for Influenza A jumped from 18.22% to 25.70%, indicating a rapid spread of the virus. Given these trends, healthcare providers should be prepared for a continued influx of influenza-related cases and consider strategies for vaccination, public awareness, and resource allocation to manage this surge effectively.
