Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a general uptrend, increasing from 4361.19 to 4697.53, signaling a bullish market sentiment. The VIX, which is inversely related to market confidence, has fluctuated but ended slightly lower at 16.48 compared to the starting value of 20.00, indicating a stabilization in volatility and a potentially positive outlook for equities. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 also reflect an upward trajectory, suggesting a global trend of positive investor sentiment. Gold Futures have seen some volatility but closed higher at 1816.40, which could imply a hedge against potential inflation or uncertainties. Crude Oil Futures experienced a dip towards the end of the period but recovered to 81.27, and the forex pairs EUR/USD and USD/JPY remained relatively stable, indicating a steady currency market, while a slight depreciation of the USD against the CNY might suggest shifting dynamics in trade or economic expectations between the US and China.
