Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a rising trend in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, starting from 5.79% and peaking at 10.52% in the most recent week. This increase exceeds the average ratio of 7.84% and suggests a growing impact of these respiratory conditions on overall mortality. Notably, there was a sharp rise in deaths from Influenza in the 7th week, followed by a sustained increase in Pneumonia-related deaths, culminating in a significant spike in the final week. The highest number of deaths from both Influenza and Pneumonia occurred in the last recorded week, which could indicate a potential strain on healthcare resources due to these illnesses. The trend warrants close monitoring and may require a targeted healthcare response to address the increased burden of Influenza and Pneumonia on mortality rates.
