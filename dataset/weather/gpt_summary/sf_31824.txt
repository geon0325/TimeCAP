Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have shown a typical diurnal cycle with a gradual decrease overnight, reaching a minimum in the early hours, before rising again during the day. Humidity levels fluctuated, with a notable increase towards the end of the review period, which could suggest the development of more moist conditions or the approach of a weather system that could bring precipitation. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight increase observed, indicating stable weather conditions are likely to persist in the short term. Wind speeds were generally moderate but showed some variability, with a peak in the earlier part of the period, which could have led to cooler perceived temperatures due to wind chill. The wind direction was predominantly westerly, which is typical for San Francisco and can bring in marine air, affecting local climate conditions, such as fog development along the coast.
