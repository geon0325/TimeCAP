Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a relatively stable temperature profile, with a slight fluctuation indicative of a typical diurnal cycle. Humidity levels have varied noticeably, starting and ending the period at moderate levels but exhibiting a significant drop mid-period, suggesting the passage of a dry air mass or frontal boundary. Air pressure readings initially held steady but later exhibited a rising trend, which is often associated with the approach of a high-pressure system that could lead to clearer skies and calmer weather conditions. Wind speeds increased significantly throughout the day, reaching their peak in the latter hours, which may have contributed to a wind chill effect, making it feel colder than the actual temperature. The wind direction has been predominantly from the east and northeast, shifting briefly to the west before returning to an easterly component, which is typical for coastal cities like New York and may influence marine conditions along the shoreline.
