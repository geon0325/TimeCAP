Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a notable decrease in temperature, descending from a high in the late afternoon to a significantly cooler temperature by early morning, indicative of typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the period, which could lead to a perception of cooler temperatures and possibly contribute to morning fog, a common occurrence in the region. Air pressure was relatively stable with a slight increasing trend during the day, suggesting steady weather conditions without the immediate approach of a significant weather system. Wind speeds were generally light to calm, with occasional mild breezes, and no strong gusts were recorded; this lack of significant wind activity would contribute to the persistence of humidity and fog. Wind direction varied throughout the day but showed no dominant pattern, which is characteristic of a region influenced by varied coastal and land terrains.
