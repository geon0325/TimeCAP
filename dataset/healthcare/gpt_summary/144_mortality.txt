Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia to the total number of deaths has shown an increasing trend, rising from 5.55% to a peak of 7.64% before slightly decreasing to 7.28% in the last recorded week. The total number of deaths fluctuated modestly, with a peak in week 14, whereas deaths specifically from Influenza have consistently increased, reaching a peak in the final week. Pneumonia-related deaths exhibited a more variable pattern but also peaked in the last week, despite a slight dip in the preceding weeks. The average mortality ratio of 7.84% was exceeded in the latter half of the period, indicating a period of heightened impact from these respiratory diseases. These trends suggest an increased burden on healthcare resources dedicated to respiratory illnesses and may indicate a need for heightened preventative measures or resource allocation.
