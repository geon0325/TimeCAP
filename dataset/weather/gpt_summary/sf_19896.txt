Over the last 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have shown slight fluctuations with a general trend of cooling during the early hours and then a gradual increase towards the latter part of the day. Humidity levels have remained high, suggesting a potential for fog or mist, especially with the humidity peaking at night and early morning. The air pressure has been relatively stable, with a slight decrease observed recently, which could indicate an approaching change in the weather system. Wind speeds have been consistently light, with very little variation, which may contribute to a stagnation of the local atmosphere and could result in sustained higher humidity levels. A notable shift in wind direction occurred in the evening, transitioning from northeasterly to a more variable pattern, which could bring a change in weather conditions, such as a shift in temperature or cloud cover.
