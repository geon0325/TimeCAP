Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a significant upward trend in both the number of respiratory specimens tested for influenza and the number of positive cases for Influenza A and B. The average positivity ratio of 6.26% has been exceeded in recent weeks, with the latest week showing a positivity rate of 28.28%, indicating a substantial increase in influenza activity. Influenza A has shown a steeper increase in positivity rates compared to Influenza B, with the latest percentages at 14.69% and 13.59%, respectively. The peak in Influenza A and B cases in the latest weeks suggests a potential surge in healthcare demand, possibly straining healthcare resources and requiring increased attention to influenza management and prevention strategies. This trend requires immediate public health interventions to mitigate the impact on vulnerable populations and healthcare systems.
