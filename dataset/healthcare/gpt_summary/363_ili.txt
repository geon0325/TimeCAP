The Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data over the last 20 weeks shows a decreasing trend in the overall percentage of patients experiencing ILI after an initial peak, eventually settling below the baseline threshold of 2.9%. The highest incidence of ILI was witnessed in the youngest age group (0-4 years), while the lowest incidence was observed in the oldest age group (65 or more). There was a notable spike in ILI cases among patients aged 25-49 at an earlier point in the timeframe, indicating a significant, albeit temporary, burden on the healthcare resources catering to this age group. As the overall ILI percentage has decreased, the pressure on healthcare systems might have lessened, but the consistently highest rates of ILI in the youngest age group could indicate a need for focused pediatric care and monitoring. The downward trend in ILI cases across all age groups in recent weeks suggests that the current healthcare situation may be stabilizing, yet continued surveillance is essential to manage and anticipate any potential resurgence of ILI cases.
