Over the last 20 weeks, there has been an upward trend in the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, peaking at 8.33% in week 16, significantly above the average ratio of 7.84%. This peak coincides with a notable surge in deaths attributed to influenza, which rose sharply from 8 deaths in week 1 to 671 deaths in week 16, suggesting a severe influenza season or outbreak. Despite a slight decrease in total deaths from week 16 onwards, the number of deaths from pneumonia has remained relatively high, with week 20 reporting 3898 deaths. This persistent burden of pneumonia may indicate a sustained strain on healthcare resources, necessitating continued public health attention and resource allocation. The elevated mortality ratio in the latter half of the 20-week period underlines the importance of monitoring these respiratory illnesses and strengthening preventive measures, especially during times of increased influenza activity.
