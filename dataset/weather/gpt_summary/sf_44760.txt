Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced extraordinarily stable weather conditions, with no fluctuations in temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed, or wind direction. The temperature has remained exceptionally high, indicating a heatwave situation which is unusual for the city's typically moderate climate. Humidity levels have been consistently low, suggesting dry air that could elevate fire risk and cause discomfort for sensitive groups. Steady air pressure points to a stable weather pattern without immediate signs of change. The wind has maintained a gentle pace from a southeast direction, which may have provided some relief from the heat but does little to disrupt the current weather pattern.
