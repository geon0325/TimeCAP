Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has shown a typical diurnal cycle with a peak during the afternoon and a gradual decline overnight into the early morning hours. Humidity levels have fluctuated considerably, increasing significantly during the night, which is common due to cooling temperatures leading to a higher relative humidity, and then decreasing during the warmer daytime. Air pressure has remained relatively stable with a slight decreasing trend in the last few hours, indicating a potential change in the weather pattern that could be associated with an approaching weather system. Wind speeds have varied, with a generally light to moderate breeze, and have been strongest in the afternoon, coinciding with the peak in temperature. The wind direction has been predominantly from the south to southeast, which is typical for Houston and could contribute to the transport of humid air from the Gulf of Mexico inland, affecting local weather conditions.
