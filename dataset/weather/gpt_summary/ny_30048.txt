Over the past 24 hours in New York City, temperatures have been on a steady rise, indicating a warming trend that peaked in the later hours. Humidity levels experienced fluctuations but generally showed a decreasing trend towards the end of the period, which could suggest drier air moving into the area. Air pressure has been gradually decreasing, which is often associated with the approach of a low-pressure system that could lead to changing weather conditions, such as increased cloudiness or precipitation. Wind speeds have increased over the day, reaching their highest values in the evening, which may contribute to a wind chill effect, making it feel colder than the actual temperature. The wind has been predominantly blowing from the south to the southwest, which often brings warmer air masses to the region, consistent with the observed temperature increase.
