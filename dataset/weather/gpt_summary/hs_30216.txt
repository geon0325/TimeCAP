Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature exhibited a diurnal pattern, with a noticeable increase during the daylight hours followed by a gradual decline after sunset, which is typical for the region. Relative humidity levels rose significantly overnight, reaching saturation at certain points, which could have led to fog or dew formation in the early morning before decreasing as temperatures rose. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting a lack of significant weather fronts passing through during this period. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate and showed an increase towards the latter part of the day, which could be indicative of a developing weather system. The prevailing wind direction was primarily from the south to south-west, which is common for Houston and can contribute to the transport of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico into the area.
