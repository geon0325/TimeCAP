Over the last 20 weeks, the ratio of mortality due to Influenza or Pneumonia to total deaths has shown an increasing trend, starting at 5.55% and peaking at 8.33% in week 14, before stabilizing around the 20-week average of 7.84%. The total number of deaths fluctuated but showed a general increase, reaching its highest point in week 14 with 61,090 deaths. Notably, deaths from Influenza increased significantly from 14 in the first week to 367 in the last week, while deaths from Pneumonia also rose from 2,814 to 3,890 over the same period. This upward trend in mortality due to respiratory illnesses suggests a growing burden on healthcare resources and could indicate a need for increased healthcare interventions or vaccination campaigns. The spike in Influenza mortality between weeks 13 and 15, with a sixfold increase, is particularly concerning and warrants further investigation into potential causes, such as a more virulent strain or lower vaccination rates.
