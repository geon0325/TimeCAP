Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia to the total number of deaths started below the 20-week average of 7.84%, with the first five weeks ranging from 5.46% to 6.23%. However, there was a notable spike in weeks 9 and 10, where the ratio surged to 19.37% and 19.40%, correspondingly, coinciding with a significant increase in total deaths to 86,888 and 87,232 for those weeks. Following this peak, the ratio has shown a consistent downward trend, concluding at 8.41% in the 20th week, which is slightly above the overall average. Deaths specifically attributable to influenza have been relatively low, peaking at 203 in week 8, and then dramatically decreasing to 17 by week 20. The declining mortality ratio alongside the decreasing number of deaths due to Influenza and Pneumonia in recent weeks could indicate a potential easing of the healthcare burden from these illnesses, but the spike in weeks 9 and 10 suggests the need for continued vigilance and readiness for potential future surges.
