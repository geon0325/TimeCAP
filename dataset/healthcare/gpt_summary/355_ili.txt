Over the last 20 weeks, the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data show a fluctuating trend with an initial increase in the ratio of ILI patients, which eventually surpassed the baseline threshold, indicating a peak in ILI cases. This peak was followed by a decline that brought the ratio back below the baseline. Notably, the highest burden of ILI was observed among the youngest and working-age populations, with a particularly sharp increase in cases among individuals aged 5-24 and 25-49 during the peak period. After the peak, all age groups experienced a decline in ILI cases, yet the data suggest a persistent circulation of ILI in the community. These trends highlight the need for continued vigilance in public health efforts and resource allocation to manage and prevent ILI, especially in vulnerable age groups and during times when ILI ratios exceed the baseline.
