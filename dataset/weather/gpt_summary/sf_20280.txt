Over the last 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have exhibited a general cooling trend during the early hours, followed by a gradual increase towards the latter part of the series, suggesting a typical diurnal cycle with cooler mornings and warmer afternoons. Humidity levels were high throughout the period, peaking during the early morning hours, which is consistent with cooler temperatures and could have led to morning fog or mist. Air pressure remained relatively stable with only minor fluctuations, indicating a period of settled weather without significant frontal activity. Wind speeds were consistently light, which would not have contributed much to dispersing atmospheric moisture, possibly exacerbating the high humidity conditions. The wind direction varied slightly but remained predominantly from the northeast, suggesting a gentle onshore flow that could have influenced the coastal weather conditions.
