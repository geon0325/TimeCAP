Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a slight uptrend, increasing from 4501.89 to 4514.87, indicating a modestly bullish sentiment among investors. Volatility, as measured by the VIX, has decreased from 15.92 to 13.88, suggesting increased market stability. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 indices have both experienced upward momentum, with the Nikkei climbing from 32159.28 to 32333.46 and the FTSE rising from 7529.20 to 7473.70, reflecting positive investor sentiment in both the Asian and European markets. Gold Futures have also seen a rise from 1932.00 to 1944.30, possibly indicating a hedge against potential market uncertainties or inflation concerns. Currency exchange rates have remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations; however, an overall weakening of the USD against the JPY and a slight strengthening against the CNY can be observed, which could affect international trade dynamics and foreign investment inflows.
