Over the last 24 hours, New York City has experienced a relatively stable temperature profile with a slight warming trend observed during the day, which is typical for diurnal variation. Humidity levels have varied significantly, with a marked increase towards the end of the period, suggesting the potential development of fog or precipitation if these conditions persist. Air pressure has been steadily increasing, indicating the likely presence of a high-pressure system, which is often associated with clearer skies and calmer weather conditions. Wind speed has decreased notably from earlier gusty conditions to a calm state, with occasional light breezes. The wind direction has been predominantly from the northwest, shifting to a southerly direction briefly, before returning to a northerly pattern, which is consistent with the passage of a frontal system.
