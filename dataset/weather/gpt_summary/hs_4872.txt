Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before gradually cooling down. Despite this rise in temperature, the humidity remained relatively stable, with a noticeable increase in the early morning hours, which could have resulted in a muggy start to the day. Air pressure showed a slight declining trend throughout the period, which may suggest the potential for changing weather patterns or the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds were generally light with a few periods of calm; however, there was an increase towards the end of the period that could contribute to a breezier condition moving forward. Wind direction varied significantly, indicating a lack of a dominant weather front during this time frame.
