Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have remained relatively stable, indicating a consistent weather pattern with no significant fluctuations. Humidity levels have stayed very high, often reaching saturation, which might have led to persistent fog or low clouds typical for the region, potentially affecting visibility. Air pressure has been gradually decreasing, suggesting an incoming weather system that could change the current conditions. Wind speeds have been low to moderate, and while there has been some variability, the winds have generally been light enough not to have a pronounced impact on the immediate weather. The wind direction has varied, mainly coming from the west and southwest, which is common for coastal San Francisco and can bring in marine air, contributing to the cool and humid conditions observed.
