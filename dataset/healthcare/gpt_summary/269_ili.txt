Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a downward trend in the incidence of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) across all age groups. The ratio of ILI patients has declined significantly from its peak, eventually falling below the baseline level, suggesting a decrease in ILI activity. Despite the overall reduction, the youngest age group (0-4 years) has seen a slight increase in ILI numbers in recent weeks, which may require ongoing monitoring and targeted healthcare responses. The substantial decrease in ILI ratios is likely to alleviate the pressure on healthcare resources that may have been heightened during the peak of ILI activity. However, healthcare systems should remain vigilant and prepared for potential fluctuations in ILI cases, especially within vulnerable age groups such as the very young and elderly populations.
