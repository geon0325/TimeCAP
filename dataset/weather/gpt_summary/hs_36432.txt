Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has shown a gradual increase, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before slightly cooling down towards the evening. Humidity levels experienced significant fluctuations, starting high in the early hours, decreasing markedly towards the afternoon, and then rising modestly again by nightfall. Air pressure has been on a steady decline throughout the period, indicating the potential development of unstable weather conditions or the approach of a weather system. Wind speed varied, with periods of higher gusts interspersed with calmer intervals; however, the latter part of the day saw a decrease in wind speed. The predominant wind direction was southerly, shifting to a more westerly direction by the end of the 24-hour period, which could be associated with the movement of weather systems through the region.
