Over the last 24 hours, New York City experienced a gradual increase in temperature, indicative of a warming trend. Humidity levels showed a significant decrease throughout the period, suggesting drier air moving into the area. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase towards the end of the observed period, possibly signaling the approach of a high-pressure system which could lead to clearer skies. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate but increased later, with prevailing winds coming from the north to northwest. The consistency in wind direction and the increase in wind speed could contribute to the dispersal of any lingering moisture, potentially reducing cloud cover and chances of precipitation.
