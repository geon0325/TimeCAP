Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable upsurge in respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the percentage of positive samples more than quadrupling from 0.13% to 0.28%. Despite fluctuations, the ratio of positive tests for Influenza A saw a significant rise in the final two weeks, jumping from 0.05% to 0.22%. In contrast, Influenza B showed a more stable pattern with a slight increase towards the end of the period, maintaining a positive specimen ratio between 0.03% and 0.08%. The total number of specimens tested has also increased steadily, peaking at 57,035 in the last week, indicative of heightened surveillance or increased incidence of respiratory illnesses. This trend of rising influenza positivity rates, particularly for Influenza A, could signal the onset of a more active influenza season, which may strain healthcare resources and necessitate increased public health measures.
