Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a gradual decrease in the overall number of patients presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms across all age groups. This trend is mirrored by a steady decline in the ratio of ILI patients, which has consistently remained below the baseline of 2.9% that is used to determine heightened influenza activity. The most significant decrease in ILI cases has been observed in the younger age groups (0-4 and 5-24 years), traditionally considered as high-transmission demographics for influenza. Although there has been a slight uptick in ILI cases in the most recent weeks, the numbers still fall below the baseline, suggesting that the healthcare system is not currently experiencing an influenza outbreak. Nonetheless, continued monitoring is essential, particularly as the slight increase could signal the beginning of an upward trend, which would have implications for resource allocation and preventive healthcare measures.
