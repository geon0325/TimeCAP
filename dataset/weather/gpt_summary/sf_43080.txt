Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a marked fluctuation in temperature, with a notable increase during the day, followed by a decrease later in the evening, indicative of typical diurnal temperature variation. The humidity levels have also seen significant variation, starting low, peaking during the night, and then dropping to very low levels, which could have implications for comfort and may increase the risk of wildfires. Air pressure has remained relatively stable with only slight variations, suggesting a steady weather pattern without the immediate influence of strong weather fronts. Wind speeds have generally been light to moderate, with some variability but no strong gusts, likely providing little relief from the heat during the day but also not exacerbating fire risks. The wind direction has been variable, shifting throughout the day, which could lead to differing local weather effects such as changes in temperature and humidity in microclimates within the city.
