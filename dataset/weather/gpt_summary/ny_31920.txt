Over the past 24 hours in New York City, there has been a gradual increase in temperature, indicating a warming trend that peaked during the latter part of the day. Humidity levels varied significantly, starting at moderate levels, spiking to very high levels around dawn—which is common due to overnight cooling and possible local condensation—before decreasing toward the evening. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, suggesting that no significant weather fronts were passing through the area. Wind speeds were mostly light to gentle, with some variability but without any strong gusts, maintaining calm conditions. The wind direction shifted throughout the day, starting from southerly winds, swinging to a brief northerly direction, then predominantly westerly, which could suggest the passage of a weak weather system or local variations in wind patterns.
