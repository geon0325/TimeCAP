Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 index has exhibited a general uptrend, closing higher at 3626.91 from an initial 3443.12, which indicates a bullish sentiment in the stock market. In contrast, the VIX, which measures market volatility, has decreased from 29.35 to 22.45, suggesting that investors are feeling less anxious and more confident in the market's stability. International equity markets have followed a similar pattern, with Japan's Nikkei 225 showing strong gains, rising from 23567.04 to 25906.93, and the UK's FTSE 100 also advancing from 5889.20 to 6421.30, both reflecting positive investor sentiment. Gold Futures have remained relatively stable with a slight increase, indicating that while investors are leaning towards riskier assets, there is still some demand for traditional safe-haven investments. The currency markets have shown less volatility, with minor fluctuations in EUR/USD and USD/CNY exchange rates, while the USD/JPY has seen a modest depreciation, potentially signaling slight shifts in the currency strength dynamics.
