Over the last 24 hours, New York City experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before slowly declining towards the evening. Humidity levels showed significant variation, with a notable increase during the morning hours, which then decreased sharply by the evening, indicative of drier conditions setting in. Air pressure decreased steadily throughout the day, suggesting a shift towards potentially less stable weather conditions. Wind speeds were variable but increased significantly in the afternoon, reaching their highest levels towards the evening, and wind directions shifted from northerly to predominantly westerly, indicating a change in the weather system affecting the city.
