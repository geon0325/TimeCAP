Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature with a general trend of cooling followed by a gradual warming. Humidity levels remained very high throughout the period, even reaching saturation at several points, which could have led to foggy conditions particularly during the early hours. Air pressure remained relatively steady and high, indicating stable atmospheric conditions. There was very light wind, with speeds remaining mostly constant and low, and the wind direction was predominantly from the west, with slight variations. The combination of high humidity, stable pressure, and light westerly winds is typical for the coastal climate of San Francisco, potentially resulting in cool, damp conditions that may persist.
