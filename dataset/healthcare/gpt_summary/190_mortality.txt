Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in the mortality rate from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, with the ratio peaking significantly in the last two weeks at 19.37% and 19.40%, respectively. This surge far exceeds the 20-week average ratio of 7.84% and suggests a potential outbreak or increased virulence of these respiratory diseases. The lowest ratios were observed in the sixth and seventh weeks at 5.20% and 5.27%, indicating a temporary improvement or underreporting during that period. The total number of deaths spiked dramatically in the 19th and 20th weeks, which coincides with the increased mortality ratio from Influenza and Pneumonia, pointing towards a possible health crisis. Healthcare systems may need to prepare for heightened demand and ensure adequate resources are in place to manage and mitigate the effects of these respiratory illnesses.
