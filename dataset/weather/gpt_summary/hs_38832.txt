Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, with the coolest conditions occurring during the early morning hours, which is typical for the diurnal temperature cycle. Concurrently, humidity levels have shown significant variability, decreasing during the day as temperatures peaked, and then rising sharply towards the evening and overnight, indicating the presence of moisture in the air, which could contribute to morning fog or dew. Air pressure remained relatively stable and high throughout the period, suggesting settled weather conditions without significant changes or the approach of a major weather system. Wind speeds were moderate to fresh at times but have generally shown a decreasing trend towards the end of the 24-hour period, which could lead to a calmer atmosphere and potentially the accumulation of pollutants in the absence of dispersion by stronger winds. Finally, the wind direction has been predominantly from the north to northeast, shifting to easterly and occasionally southeast, which may have implications for local temperature and humidity as maritime influences could come into play.
