Humidity levels were high during the early hours but showed a noticeable decrease as temperatures rose, suggesting a possible increase in comfort levels despite the heat. Air pressure remained relatively stable but experienced a slight dip towards the end of the period, which could be indicative of an approaching weather system or front.
