Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, culminating in notably warmer conditions by the end of the observed period. Humidity levels were initially high but showed a decreasing trend throughout the day, suggesting the presence of drier air moving into the area. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight decrease observed, which could indicate an approaching weather system or front. Wind speeds varied, with some calmer periods and others with more brisk conditions; however, there was a significant shift in wind direction in the later hours, pointing to a possible change in weather patterns. Overall, the combination of rising temperatures, decreasing humidity, slightly falling air pressure, and shifting wind patterns suggest that Houston may be transitioning to a different weather regime, potentially leading to clearer and warmer conditions.
