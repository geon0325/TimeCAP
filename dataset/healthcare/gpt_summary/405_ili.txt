Over the analyzed 20-week period, the proportion of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases among the total patient count has exceeded the 2.9% severity benchmark for 15 consecutive weeks, with a peak ILI percentage of 7.37% in week 7. The age group of 5-24 years has consistently reported the highest number of ILI cases, reaching a maximum of 61,015 cases in week 4, which suggests a significant impact on school-aged children and young adults. Notably, weeks 1-2 and 18-20 have shown ILI percentages below the threshold, indicating a possible decline in ILI activity towards the end of the analyzed period. The oldest age group (65 or more) has shown a relatively stable range of ILI cases, with a slight increase during the mid-period, which could be indicative of higher hospitalization and complication rates within this demographic. The sustained elevation in ILI percentages above the benchmark necessitates continued healthcare resource allocation to manage the potential strain on medical facilities and address the public health implications, particularly for the highly affected young population.
