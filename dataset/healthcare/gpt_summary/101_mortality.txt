Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a fluctuating but generally decreasing trend in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, starting at 6.84% and ending at 6.39%, with a peak at 8.33% in week three. The total number of deaths has decreased from 57,370 to 53,644, while deaths from influenza peaked at 671 in week three and then showed a downward trend to 156 in the last week. Deaths from pneumonia started at 3,759, peaked at 4,418 in week three, and subsequently decreased to 3,273 in the final week, indicating a potential improvement in the management or prevalence of these illnesses. The highest ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia to total deaths was observed in week 14 at 7.75%, surpassing the 20-week average of 7.34%, which could imply seasonal variability or other factors influencing mortality rates. The overall downward trend in both total deaths and deaths from Influenza or Pneumonia suggests an easing burden on healthcare systems, but continuous monitoring is required to manage potential outbreaks and understand long-term trends.
