Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual decline in temperature after reaching a peak, followed by a sharp drop and then a steady rise through the remainder of the period. Humidity levels showed an inverse relationship with temperature, where humidity peaked as the temperature saw its sharpest decline, indicating possible precipitation or the passing of a front. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase in the middle of the period, suggesting stable weather conditions with no significant frontal systems moving through the area. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with no significant gusts, maintaining steady conditions that are unlikely to cause weather-related disruptions. The wind direction varied, with a notable shift from westerly to southerly winds, which could have been associated with any changes in temperature and humidity encountered during the period.
