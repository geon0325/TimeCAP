Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has demonstrated a gradual upward trend, indicating a warming pattern that could affect both outdoor comfort levels and energy consumption for cooling purposes. Humidity levels have been on a decreasing trajectory, which may lead to more comfortable conditions, particularly when combined with the rising temperatures. Air pressure has shown a slight downward trend, which could potentially signal a change in weather patterns, possibly leading to increased cloudiness or the development of precipitation if this trend continues. Wind speeds have remained fairly consistent, suggesting stable weather conditions for the moment. The wind direction has experienced a subtle shift towards the south-southeast, which is typical for this region and may contribute to the moisture influx from the Gulf, influencing both temperature and humidity levels.
