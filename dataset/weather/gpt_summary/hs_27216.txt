Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have exhibited a gradual warming trend from cooler early morning hours to warmer afternoon temperatures, followed by a slight decrease towards the current hour. Humidity levels were high throughout the period, reaching saturation at multiple points, which suggests the possibility of fog or dew formation, particularly during times when the temperature was cooler and the air pressure was stable or rising. Air pressure varied but showed a significant increase at one point, indicating a transient high-pressure system that might have led to clearer skies temporarily. Wind speeds remained generally light to gentle with some increase later in the period, which could have contributed to minor wind chill effects during cooler hours and modest dispersion of humidity. Wind direction was variable, predominantly coming from the east and southeast, which is typical for Houston and may bring moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, influencing local humidity and temperature conditions.
