Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable upward trend in the ratio of patients presenting with Influenza-like Illness (ILI), surpassing the baseline of 2.9% in the latter half of the observed period. This increase is particularly pronounced in the younger age groups, with those aged 5-24 showing the most significant rise, suggesting that the ILI is spreading more rapidly among school-aged children and young adults. The sustained elevation of ILI ratios above the baseline indicates a potential strain on healthcare resources, as the system may need to allocate more to diagnose, treat, and manage the increasing number of ILI cases. The peak in ILI ratios corresponds with the typical flu season, highlighting the need for heightened awareness and possibly increased vaccination efforts. Despite the rising trend, the latest data points suggest a slight decrease in ILI ratios, indicating that the ILI incidence may be starting to plateau or decline, though it still remains above the baseline, suggesting continued vigilance is necessary.
