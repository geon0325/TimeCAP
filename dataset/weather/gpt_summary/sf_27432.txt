Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have experienced a natural diurnal cycle, starting and ending on a mild note with a noticeable dip during the night. Humidity levels showed significant variation, beginning moderately high in the earlier hours, sharply decreasing through the day, and then increasing again overnight, indicative of the changing air mass and possibly the influence of marine air. Air pressure fluctuated within a moderate range, with a general increase towards the end of the period, which could suggest a stabilizing weather pattern.
