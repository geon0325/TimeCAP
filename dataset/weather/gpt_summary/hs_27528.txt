Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the latter part of the day before a slight decrease. Humidity levels started off moderate but significantly rose to saturation in the morning hours, followed by a sharp decline towards the evening, indicating the possibility of morning fog or dew clearing as the day progressed. Air pressure demonstrated variability with a notable peak, suggesting the influence of a high-pressure system that could have led to clearer skies and calmer weather conditions. Wind speeds remained consistently light throughout the day, with a marginal increase by the end of the period, which would not have contributed significantly to any weather changes. Wind direction varied widely, although predominantly from a northerly direction, shifting towards the east, which could have brought cooler air earlier in the day before a shift to warmer conditions.
