In contrast, the VIX, a measure of market volatility, has decreased from 29.18 to 23.10, indicating a reduction in market uncertainty and risk aversion among investors. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 indices have both followed an upward trajectory, reflective of global market recovery, with the Nikkei 225 moving from 23671.13 to 25385.87, and the FTSE 100 modestly climbing from 5884.70 to 6316.40. Gold Futures have remained relatively stable, fluctuating within a narrow band, ending slightly lower at 1885.70 from an initial 1906.40, which could suggest investors are shifting towards riskier assets as market confidence grows. Lastly, crude oil futures have experienced volatility but ended slightly lower at 40.13 from 40.83, and major currency pairs such as EUR/USD and USD/JPY have held relatively stable, indicating a steadiness in foreign exchange markets amidst these market conditions.
