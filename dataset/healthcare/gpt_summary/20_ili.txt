Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a consistent trend below the baseline level for Influenza-like Illness (ILI) with the ratio of ILI patients remaining under the threshold. The age group 0-4 consistently reported the highest number of ILI cases, suggesting a higher vulnerability or transmission rate among young children, which could prompt targeted public health interventions. Notably, in recent weeks, there has been an uptick in ILI cases across all age groups, with the oldest and youngest age groups showing the most significant increases, which could signal the onset of an upward trend in ILI activity. Despite the overall ILI ratios being below the baseline, the recent increase across all age demographics may place additional demands on healthcare resources if the trend continues. Continuous monitoring is crucial to anticipate potential spikes and to enable healthcare systems to allocate resources effectively to manage any potential outbreaks.
