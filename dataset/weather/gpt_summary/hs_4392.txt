Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a general decline in temperature, transitioning from warmer conditions to a more moderate climate, indicative of a typical diurnal pattern where temperatures decrease overnight. Humidity levels have fluctuated significantly, with periods of complete saturation suggesting the possibility of fog or dew formation, especially when humidity reached its peak concurrently with the lowest temperatures. Air pressure has been on a gradual descent, which could signal an approaching weather system that may result in instability and potential precipitation. The wind speed has varied, with calmer conditions prevailing at times, but there have been increases that could enhance the wind chill factor, making it feel cooler than actual temperatures. Wind directions have been predominantly from the south and southeast, which in Houston can often bring in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, contributing to higher humidity levels and the chance of rain.
