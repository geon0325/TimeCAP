Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature which later reversed into a warming trend, suggesting the passage of a weather front. Relative humidity levels have seen significant fluctuations, indicating variable atmospheric moisture that could lead to changing weather conditions. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable but showed a notable peak, which could be associated with transient high-pressure systems that often result in clearer skies. Wind speeds varied moderately throughout the period, with a couple of instances of higher speeds that might have contributed to a wind chill effect, making it feel cooler than actual temperatures. The wind direction was predominantly westerly with occasional shifts, which is typical for coastal areas like San Francisco, where ocean breezes influence the local climate.
