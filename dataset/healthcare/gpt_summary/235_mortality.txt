Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, with a marked increase from an initial 6.73% to a peak of 16.83% in week 8, before a subsequent decline and a recent upswing to 13.21% in week 20. The absolute number of deaths attributed to Influenza has remained relatively low, with a slight increase towards the end of the period, whereas deaths from Pneumonia have shown a more pronounced upward trend, rising from 3,833 in week 1 to 9,419 in week 20. The total number of deaths has also varied, with a peak at week 20 (71,539), indicating a potential surge in overall mortality. The ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia to total deaths has exceeded the average of 7.84% for most of the period, suggesting a growing impact of these conditions on overall mortality rates. This data could indicate the need for increased healthcare resources and prevention strategies targeting respiratory infections, particularly Pneumonia, which is the more significant contributor to the elevated mortality rate.
