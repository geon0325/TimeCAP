Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a gradual increase in the incidence of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) across all age groups. Despite this rise, the ratio of ILI patients to total patient count has remained below the 2.9% benchmark that defines a severe influenza situation. The largest absolute increase in ILI cases has occurred in the 0-4 age group, suggesting a higher vulnerability or increased transmission within this demographic. The steady rise in ILI ratios over the period suggests a growing trend that the healthcare system should monitor closely, as it may indicate an impending approach towards the threshold of severity. Although currently below the benchmark, the consistent upward trajectory in ILI cases necessitates proactive planning in healthcare resource allocation and public health interventions to manage potential outbreaks.
