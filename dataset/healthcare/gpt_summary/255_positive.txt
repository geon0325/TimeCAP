Over the last 20 weeks, the total number of respiratory specimens tested for influenza showed an upward trend, with a peak at week 15 (42,526 specimens), while the percentage of positive specimens fluctuated, with a peak at week 4 (0.40%) and a minimum at week 3 (0.18%), remaining below the average ratio of positive specimens (6.26%). The number of positive specimens for Influenza A remained relatively stable with a slight increase towards the end, whereas Influenza B showed a more pronounced increase, particularly in the last week (95 positives). The ratio of positive specimens for Influenza A peaked at week 7 (0.20%) and then notably decreased, while the ratio for Influenza B increased over time, suggesting a shift in the prevalence between the two strains. Notably, the ratio of positive specimens for Influenza B surpassed that of Influenza A from week 5 onwards, reaching its highest at week 20 (0.21%). Given these trends, healthcare systems should prepare for an ongoing Influenza B surge and consider implications for public health interventions, vaccine formulation, and resource allocation.
