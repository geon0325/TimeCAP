Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have shown a fluctuating pattern, with a general rise observed during the daytime hours and a subsequent cooling trend as the night progressed, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels were relatively high throughout the period, peaking at nighttime and early morning, which could have resulted in a feeling of mugginess and potential for early morning fog, particularly when coupled with the higher temperatures. Air pressure experienced some variability, with a notable dip towards the end of the period, which could signal an approaching weather system or front. Wind speeds remained generally light to moderate, with occasional calms, suggesting a tranquil wind regime that would not significantly disperse atmospheric particulates, potentially affecting air quality. Wind direction shifted throughout the day, ranging from westerly to northerly, which may have influenced coastal conditions and temperatures in microclimates within the city.
