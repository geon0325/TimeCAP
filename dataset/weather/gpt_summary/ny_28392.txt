Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature with a general trend of cooling followed by a period of warming. Humidity levels have been high, often reaching saturation, which suggests the presence of fog or mist, particularly when combined with the lower temperatures observed. Air pressure has been gradually decreasing, indicating the possibility of an approaching weather system that may bring changes in the weather pattern, such as increased cloudiness or precipitation. Wind speeds have varied, with a period of stronger winds that have since calmed down, while the wind direction has been predominantly from the northeast, shifting significantly in the later hours. This combination of weather indicators suggests a dynamic atmospheric environment that could lead to varying weather conditions in the short term.
