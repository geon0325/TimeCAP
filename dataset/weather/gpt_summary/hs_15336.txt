Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has exhibited a diurnal cycle with a peak during the late afternoon and a gradual decrease overnight, consistent with expectations. Humidity levels were notably high, reaching saturation in the early morning hours, which may have contributed to fog or mist formation, particularly when coupled with the relatively stable air pressure suggesting limited frontal activity. A sharp increase in wind speed in the latest hours could indicate the approach of a weather system, introducing variability in the weather conditions. The wind direction varied significantly throughout the period, starting with easterly winds and transitioning to southerly, then westerly, and finally shifting to northerly, which may affect local temperatures and weather patterns. The air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting the absence of significant weather disturbances during the observed time frame.
