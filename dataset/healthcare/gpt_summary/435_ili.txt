Over the past 20 weeks, the proportion of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases among the total patient count has remained below the severity benchmark of 2.9% in all age groups. The highest ILI percentage observed was 2.13% in the most recent week, indicating a gradual increase after reaching a low of 1.19% in Week 10. Notably, the age group 0-4 showed the most significant rise in ILI cases towards the latter part of the 20-week period, peaking at 10,912 cases in the final week. The data reveals a steady increase in the ILI ratio over the last six weeks, which could indicate the onset of an upward trend that healthcare providers should monitor closely. Despite the current ILI percentages remaining below the threshold of concern, the increasing trend warrants attention to ensure the healthcare system is prepared to respond if the ILI ratio continues to rise.
