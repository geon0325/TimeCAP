Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, reaching its lowest point during the latter part of the time series, before slightly rising again. The humidity levels remained at saturation for a significant portion of the day, which could have led to foggy conditions and potentially contributed to a damp and chilly atmosphere. Atmospheric pressure was relatively stable, with a slight decrease noted towards the end of the period, which could indicate the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds decreased over time, suggesting a calmer period, but shifted direction from northwesterly to southwesterly, which often brings warmer air from inland. This shift in wind direction, along with the slight rise in temperature and decrease in pressure, could signal a change in the weather pattern for the following days.
