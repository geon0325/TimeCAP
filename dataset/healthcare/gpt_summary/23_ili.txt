Over the last 20 weeks, the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) activity has shown a gradual increase in the percentage of patients across all age groups. The most notable rise has been observed in the younger populations, specifically those aged 0-4 and 5-24 years, indicating a higher vulnerability or exposure in these age categories. Despite the increase, the overall ratio of ILI patients has remained well below the baseline threshold, suggesting that the healthcare system is not currently overwhelmed by ILI cases. However, the consistent uptrend in the ratio of ILI cases indicates a growing trend that warrants close monitoring, especially considering potential strain on healthcare resources should this trend continue. It is also important to note that the oldest age group, those aged 65 or more, while contributing less to the overall ILI cases, has shown a steady increase in ILI incidence, emphasizing the need for targeted health interventions for the elderly population who are more susceptible to complications.
