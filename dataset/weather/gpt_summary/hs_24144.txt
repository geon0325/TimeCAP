Over the last 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have generally trended upwards, reaching peak values in the late afternoon before gradually declining towards the evening. Humidity levels were significantly high, especially in the early morning hours when they reached saturation, indicating the potential for fog or dew; however, the humidity decreased notably as temperatures peaked. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase observed, which suggests stable weather conditions without significant fronts or storms. Wind speeds varied throughout the day, with a notable increase towards the afternoon, which could have provided some relief from the heat. The wind direction was predominantly from the south to southwest, which is typical for Houston and can contribute to warmer conditions due to the flow of air from warmer regions.
