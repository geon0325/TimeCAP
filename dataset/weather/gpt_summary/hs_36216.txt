Over the past 24 hours, the temperature in Houston has experienced a typical diurnal cycle with a gradual decrease overnight followed by a warming trend throughout the day. Humidity levels have fluctuated considerably, with notably lower humidity occurring during the warmer afternoon hours. Air pressure has seen a significant drop mid-period, possibly indicating the passage of a front or weather system, but it returned to stable, high-pressure conditions soon after. Wind speeds have been moderate with some hours of increased activity, and the prevailing wind direction has been northerly, with occasional shifts to other directions. The combination of these weather indicators suggests a generally stable weather pattern, punctuated by a transient event that caused a temporary drop in air pressure and changes in humidity levels.
