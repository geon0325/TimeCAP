Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a significant upward trend in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the average ratio of positive specimens increasing from 2.06% to 25.61%. The prevalence of Influenza A outpaces Influenza B, as evidenced by the higher percentage of Influenza A positive specimens, peaking at 25.36% in comparison to Influenza B's peak at 0.97%. The total number of specimens tested has increased over time, with a peak at week 20, suggesting heightened surveillance or an increased incidence of respiratory illness prompting testing. Despite a high of 26.24% positive specimens in week 18, there's a slight decrease in the positive ratio in the last two weeks, indicating a potential plateau or early signs of a downtrend. This upward trend in positive influenza cases could indicate a severe flu season, requiring increased healthcare resources and potentially affecting workforce availability due to illness.
