Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown an overall upward trend, closing higher by approximately 1.87% from the initial value, despite some fluctuations, which indicates a general market optimism. The VIX, commonly known as the "fear gauge," has increased from 13.79 to 16.05, suggesting that investor anxiety has risen, potentially due to uncertainties or market volatility. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 indices have experienced volatility with a slight downward bias, closing lower by about 2.08% and 1.77% respectively, which may reflect regional market pressures or global economic concerns.

Gold Futures have seen a slight decline overall, dropping by about 1.36%, indicating a potential shift in investor preference towards riskier assets or a temporary easing of safe-haven demand. Crude Oil Futures experienced a significant decrease of approximately 20.89%, and the depreciation of the USD against the CNY in the latest session could signal concerns over energy demand and broader economic implications, while the mostly stable EUR/USD and USD/JPY exchange rates suggest a relative balance in major currency markets amidst these conditions.
