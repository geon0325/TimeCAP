Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have shown a gradual increase, indicating a warming trend throughout the day. The humidity levels remained high, especially during the early hours, reaching saturation which could have potentially led to foggy conditions impacting visibility. Air pressure stayed relatively stable, suggesting a period of steady weather without significant fronts or storms passing through the area. Wind speeds were light to calm, with only minor fluctuations, which would not have contributed to any significant wind chill effects or dispersion of urban pollution. The wind direction was predominantly from the west-southwest, which is typical for San Francisco's coastal climate and may bring in marine air influencing both temperature and humidity levels.
