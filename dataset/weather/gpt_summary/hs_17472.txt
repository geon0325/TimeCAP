Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced relatively stable temperatures with a slight fluctuation, indicating typical diurnal variation with warmer temperatures during the day and slightly cooler temperatures at night. Humidity levels have been high, staying mostly in the upper echelons, which may have led to a muggy feeling for residents and could potentially contribute to the formation of fog or dew in the early morning hours. Air pressure remained largely constant, with a minor decrease noted towards the end of the period, which might suggest a slight change in the weather system but nothing indicating a major weather disturbance. Wind speeds were consistently light, which would not have contributed significantly to any dispersion of humidity or heat, potentially exacerbating the muggy conditions. Wind directions varied but showed no dominant trend, suggesting a lack of strong weather fronts moving through the area during this period.
