Over the last 24 hours in Houston, there has been a slight upward trend in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before stabilizing somewhat below that peak. Humidity levels showed a noticeable decrease during the same period when temperatures were at their highest, indicating an inverse relationship between temperature and humidity throughout the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with only minor fluctuations, suggesting a period of stable weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally low and showed little variation, with a slight increase observed during the time of highest temperatures. The wind direction was predominantly from the east to southeast, with only slight deviations, which is typical for this region and may contribute to the warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico affecting the local weather.
