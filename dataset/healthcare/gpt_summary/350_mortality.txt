Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable upward trend in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, starting at 5.82% and peaking at 9.15%, significantly above the average ratio of 7.84%. The total number of deaths has fluctuated, reaching a high of 70,168 in week 15, while the number of deaths from Influenza or Pneumonia has increased sharply, especially from Influenza, which escalated from 27 deaths to a peak of 1,048 deaths by week 13. The ratio dipped slightly towards the end of the 20-week period but remained above the average, indicating a sustained burden on healthcare resources. The spike in deaths due to these respiratory illnesses could be associated with seasonal patterns, the emergence of new virus strains, or changes in the population's health profile. These trends underline the importance of continued surveillance, vaccination efforts, and preparedness in the healthcare system to manage and mitigate the impact of respiratory infectious diseases.
