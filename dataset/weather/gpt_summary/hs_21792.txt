Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, peaking in the later hours, indicative of warm and potentially uncomfortable conditions for residents. Meanwhile, humidity levels have shown variability, with notably high levels during the cooler early morning hours, suggesting a likelihood of morning mist or fog which could affect visibility for commuters. Air pressure has remained relatively stable, indicating a period of consistent weather patterns without the immediate onset of significant weather changes such as storms. Wind speeds have been moderate but increased towards the end of the period, which could contribute to a slight cooling effect and dispersion of humidity. The wind direction has been predominantly from the south-southwest, consistent with warm air being drawn up from the Gulf, which could influence the continuation of the current warm weather pattern.
