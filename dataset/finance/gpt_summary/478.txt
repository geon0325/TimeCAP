Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown moderate volatility with a general upward trend, closing higher by approximately 3.3% from the start. The VIX, which gauges market volatility, has fluctuated but remained mostly in the low 20s, though it spiked to 25.16 at the end of the period, indicating increased market uncertainty. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 indices have experienced a mix of gains and losses, with the Nikkei showing a slight uptrend and the FTSE 100 displaying a more pronounced increase before a notable drop in the last trading session. Commodity prices for Gold and Crude Oil Futures have both increased, with Gold rising by about 2.3% and Crude Oil by roughly 10.6%, pointing to a potential increase in inflationary pressures. Currency exchange rates for the EUR/USD and USD/JPY have not shown significant changes, remaining relatively stable, while the USD/CNY pair has seen minor fluctuations but closed nearly unchanged, suggesting steady Forex market conditions for these currencies.
