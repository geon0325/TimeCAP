Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 showed a trend of initial decline followed by recovery, ending higher than the starting point which suggests increasing investor confidence or a positive market correction. The VIX, commonly known as the "fear index," fluctuated but ended slightly lower, indicating that market volatility has marginally subsided. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 indices both experienced overall growth, hinting at positive sentiment in both Asian and European markets. Gold futures increased in price, suggesting that investors may be hedging against potential market risk or inflation concerns. Meanwhile, the strengthening of the USD against the JPY and the relatively stable exchange rate of USD/CNY may point to a stronger US dollar or shifts in international trade dynamics.
