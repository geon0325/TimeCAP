Over the past 24 hours in New York City, there has been a gradual decrease in temperature, reaching its lowest point during the early morning hours before rising again towards the afternoon. Humidity levels have shown fluctuations, initially maintaining steady values before increasing significantly overnight, which could be indicative of a frontal passage or increased moisture in the air. Air pressure has been relatively stable but is now on a slight downward trend, suggesting the possible approach of a low-pressure system that could lead to changes in the weather pattern. Wind speeds have varied from calm to moderate, with periods of no wind activity, but have increased recently, which may contribute to a wind chill effect, making it feel colder than the actual temperature. The wind direction has been variable, with a notable shift towards the south and then veering to the west, which could be responsible for the transportation of cooler air masses into the region.
