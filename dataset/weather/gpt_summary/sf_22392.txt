Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature, showing a gentle warming trend during the day with a peak in the later hours, before cooling off again towards the early morning. Humidity levels were high throughout the period, hitting saturation at several points, which could have led to foggy conditions, particularly during the nighttime and early morning hours. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with only minor variations, indicating no significant incoming weather systems. Wind speeds were generally light, with the calmest conditions around dawn, and a slight increase towards the end of the period, which may have contributed to a dispersal of any fog or low-level clouds. The wind direction shifted gradually from a predominantly westerly to a more southwesterly direction, which is typical for coastal San Francisco and could influence the movement of marine air inland.
