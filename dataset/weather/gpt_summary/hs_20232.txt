Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have seen minor fluctuations, maintaining a range that suggests a relatively consistent and cool weather pattern. Humidity levels remained exceptionally high throughout the period, often reaching saturation, which could indicate the presence of fog or mist, particularly during the early hours. Air pressure has been steadily increasing, suggesting the strengthening of a high-pressure system that typically leads to stable and dry weather conditions. Wind speeds were mostly moderate, but there was an abrupt shift in wind direction during the period, which could be associated with a passing weather front or local atmospheric disturbances. Overall, the combination of high humidity, stable temperatures, and rising air pressure points towards calm but potentially misty or foggy weather conditions, with the possibility of clearer skies as the high-pressure system takes hold.
