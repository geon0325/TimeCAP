Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced relatively stable temperatures with a minor fluctuation, maintaining a cool to mild condition throughout the period. Humidity levels were consistently high, often reaching saturation, which suggests a likelihood of fog or mist formation, particularly during the early morning or night when temperatures were at their lowest. Air pressure remained notably high and showed a slight decreasing trend towards the end of the period, which could indicate a gradual change in weather patterns or the approach of a new weather system. Wind speeds were calm and steady, with no significant gusts or variations, contributing to the stable weather conditions. The wind direction was predominantly from the north to northeast, with minor variations, which is typical for this region and does not suggest any immediate, significant weather changes.
