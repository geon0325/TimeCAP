Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, indicating a warming trend that peaked in the later hours before starting to cool off again. Humidity levels saw some fluctuations, with relatively low values overall, suggesting a dry atmosphere, but ended the period with a noticeable increase. Air pressure remained fairly stable initially but underwent a significant rise followed by a slight decrease, potentially signaling a transient high-pressure system passing through. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate with some increase towards the end of the period, which could contribute to a wind chill effect, especially when coupled with the lower humidity. The wind direction was primarily from the southwest to west, with slight variations, which is typical for the city's weather patterns during this time of year.
