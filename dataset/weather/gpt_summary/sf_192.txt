Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperature has seen a typical diurnal cycle with a gradual decrease overnight reaching its lowest just before dawn, followed by a warming trend through the afternoon. Humidity levels have fluctuated significantly, peaking in the early morning hours, which could have led to the feeling of a damp and cooler start to the day, before decreasing into the evening suggesting drier conditions. Air pressure has been relatively steady but started to show a declining trend, which may indicate an approaching weather system that could lead to changes in the weather pattern. Wind speeds have been mostly light with a period of calm conditions, but there was an increase in the evening, which, coupled with shifting wind directions, suggests variable and possibly unsettled weather. The variability in wind direction over the day points to changing weather fronts that could affect local weather conditions, including the possibility of increased cloud cover or precipitation.
