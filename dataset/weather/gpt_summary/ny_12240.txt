Humidity levels varied significantly but ended on a higher note than they started, suggesting an increase in moisture in the air which could be indicative of a higher chance of precipitation or fog formation. Air pressure showed a general increase throughout the period, which is typically associated with improving weather conditions and could suggest the approach of a high-pressure system leading to clearer skies.
