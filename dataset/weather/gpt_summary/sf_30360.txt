Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature, with a general cooling trend that transitioned to a significant warming period during the latter part of the day. Humidity levels exhibited a high degree of variance, reaching a saturation point at certain hours, which suggests the potential occurrence of fog or mist, particularly when the humidity reached its peak. Air pressure saw a gradual increase towards the end of the 24-hour period, indicating the possible approach of a high-pressure system that could lead to more stable weather conditions. Wind speeds varied modestly, with periods of calm interspersed with occasional breezier conditions, but without any extreme wind events. The wind direction shifted throughout the day, which could have contributed to the variations in temperature and humidity experienced, as different air masses moved into the region.
