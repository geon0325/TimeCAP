Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching a peak in the late afternoon hours. Humidity levels showed a significant decrease as the temperature rose, suggesting an inverse relationship between these two indicators, which is typical in diurnal patterns. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with only minor fluctuations, indicating no immediate signs of significant weather fronts or systems impacting the area. Wind speeds were consistent, with occasional increases, but without any dramatic changes that would suggest turbulent weather conditions. The wind direction was predominantly from the north and northwest, which is common for this region and time of year, and can contribute to the transport of cooler air, potentially affecting the temperature trends observed.
