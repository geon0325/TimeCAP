Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a slight warming trend with temperatures gradually increasing from below to above freezing. The humidity levels remained high for most of the day, suggesting a damp and potentially foggy atmosphere across the city. Air pressure showed a decreasing trend, indicating a possibility of changing weather patterns, such as an approaching weather front that could lead to precipitation or windier conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate, with some increase in the latter part of the day, which could contribute to a wind chill effect despite the rising temperatures. The wind direction shifted from westerly to southwesterly during the day, which often brings warmer air masses to the region, aligning with the observed increase in temperature.
