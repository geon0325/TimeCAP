Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, indicating no significant weather fronts moving through the area during the observed period. Wind speed experienced some variability, with a slight increase around midday, which could have contributed to the dispersal of humidity and a slight cooling effect. The prevailing wind direction was generally southerly, with some shifts towards the southwest later in the day, suggesting a consistent weather pattern without abrupt changes.
