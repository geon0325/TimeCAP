Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable upward trend in the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to total deaths, increasing from 5.20% to 7.33%. This trend is concurrent with a rise in absolute numbers, where deaths from influenza have grown from 22 to 429 and pneumonia deaths have increased from 2869 to 4310. The total number of deaths has also escalated over the period, starting at 55,558 and reaching 64,611 by the end of the 20-week period. The increasing ratio and death counts suggest a growing impact of respiratory illnesses on overall mortality. This trend could indicate a need for heightened healthcare resources and public health interventions focused on respiratory diseases, especially as it surpasses the average mortality ratio of 7.84% in the final week analyzed.
