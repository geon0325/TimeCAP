Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a gradual increase in temperature, with the warmest conditions recorded in the latter part of the period. Humidity levels showed a significant rise during the night, reaching full saturation, before decreasing steadily as temperatures rose. Air pressure experienced a slight decreasing trend throughout much of the day, indicating a potential for changing weather conditions, but later stabilized and began to rise slightly. Wind speeds were calm initially but picked up towards the end of the period, with wind direction shifting from variable to predominantly southerly, which could bring in more humidity from the Gulf of Mexico. Overall, the combination of rising temperatures, fluctuating humidity, and changing air pressure suggests a dynamic weather pattern, with increased wind activity indicating possible changes ahead.
