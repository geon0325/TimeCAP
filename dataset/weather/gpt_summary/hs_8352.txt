Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced fluctuating temperatures that peaked during the afternoon hours before gradually decreasing toward the evening, a common diurnal pattern. Humidity levels showed significant variation, reaching saturation at certain hours, likely contributing to a feeling of mugginess and possibly correlating with fog or dew formation during the nighttime and early morning. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight increase during the middle of the period, suggesting a transient high-pressure system that could have influenced clearer skies and calmer weather conditions. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, which would not have significantly impacted the overall weather conditions, but a notable shift in wind direction occurred, indicating a change in the weather system moving through the area. The combination of these factors points to a typical weather pattern for Houston, with no extreme weather events indicated by the data provided.
