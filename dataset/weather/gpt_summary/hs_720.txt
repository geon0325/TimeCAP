Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual rise in temperature reaching its peak in the late afternoon before stabilizing towards the evening. Humidity levels showed significant variation, starting moderately, increasing to high levels during the early morning, and then decreasing as the temperature rose, suggesting a typical diurnal pattern. Air pressure was mostly stable, with a couple of notable dips, indicating the possible passage of transient weather systems or localized atmospheric disturbances. Wind speeds were generally light with a few periods of moderate gusts, and the wind direction shifted from southerly to westerly throughout the day, which could have contributed to the fluctuations in temperature and humidity.
