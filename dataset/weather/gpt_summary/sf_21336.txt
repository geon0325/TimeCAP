Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature, with a general cooling trend followed by a modest warming towards the latter part of the period. Humidity levels have been notably high, reaching saturation for several hours, which could indicate the presence of fog or mist, particularly during the early morning hours when temperatures were at their lowest. Atmospheric pressure has remained relatively stable, suggesting a period of settled weather without significant changes in weather patterns. Wind speeds have been consistently light, with a slight increase observed in the final hour, while wind direction varied, predominantly coming from the west-southwest to south-southwest, which is typical for coastal locations like San Francisco. The combination of high humidity, stable pressure, and light winds points to calm but potentially misty or foggy conditions, which are common for San Francisco's microclimate.
