Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature, showing a gradual decrease overnight which then reversed into a warming trend during the day, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels have been high, peaking towards the morning hours, which could have contributed to a muggy feeling in the air; however, a subsequent decrease in humidity was noted later in the day. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight decrease towards the end of the period, which could suggest the potential for changing weather patterns. Wind speeds were consistently light, maintaining a gentle breeze throughout the period, and wind direction shifted gradually from a southerly to a more easterly direction, which may influence local weather conditions, including the potential for sea breeze effects. Overall, the weather in Houston has been stable, but the slight changes in pressure and humidity may indicate a transition to different weather conditions in the near future.
