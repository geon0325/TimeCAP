Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have displayed a diurnal cycle, with a slight increase during the day before cooling again at night. Humidity levels have been relatively high, peaking at certain hours, which could indicate the presence of moisture and the potential for fog or dew formation, especially when they coincided with lower temperatures. Air pressure has been gradually decreasing, suggesting a possible change in weather patterns or the approach of a weather system that may lead to unsettled conditions. Wind speeds have varied but generally increased towards the latter part of the 24-hour period, indicating strengthening winds that could influence the dispersion of any atmospheric moisture or pollutants. Wind direction has been predominantly from the south, which in Houston is often associated with warmer, moister air moving inland from the Gulf of Mexico.
