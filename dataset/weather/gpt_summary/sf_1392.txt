Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have generally remained stable with slight fluctuations, indicating a relatively consistent weather pattern for the area. Humidity levels have experienced more variability, with significant increases observed, which could suggest the potential for fog or mist, particularly given San Francisco's coastal location. Air pressure has shown a gradual decrease throughout the day, a trend that can be associated with the approach of a weather system that may lead to changing conditions. Wind speeds have been variable, with some hours experiencing calm conditions and others witnessing gusty winds; this variability in wind conditions could impact marine and outdoor activities. The wind direction has been predominantly from the southerly quarter, shifting towards the west later on, which is typical for the region and may influence coastal temperatures and fog patterns.
