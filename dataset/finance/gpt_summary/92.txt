Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 exhibited moderate volatility with an initial decline in value followed by a recovery and closing slightly lower than its starting point, suggesting a level of investor uncertainty. The VIX, which measures market volatility, remained fairly stable with minor fluctuations, indicating that while there was some unease, it did not escalate into significant fear or instability in the markets. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 showed similar patterns to the S&P 500, with overall slight declines, reflecting a cautious sentiment among global equity investors. Gold futures experienced an upward trend, ending higher than the starting price, which typically signals a flight to safety amid market uncertainty. Crude oil futures saw a more pronounced drop, potentially due to concerns over global demand and economic growth, while currency exchange rates remained largely stable, with minor appreciation in the EUR/USD and USD/CNY pairs, suggesting steady forex market conditions.
