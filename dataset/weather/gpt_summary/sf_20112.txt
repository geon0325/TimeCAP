Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have shown a gradual increase, indicating a warming trend throughout the day. Humidity levels remained high, often reaching saturation, suggesting a likelihood of fog or mist, particularly during the early hours when humidity peaked. Atmospheric pressure was notably stable and high, hinting at settled weather conditions and the persistence of the current weather pattern. Wind speeds were consistently light, which would have done little to disperse the humidity or change the temperature significantly. The wind direction varied significantly, with a notable shift from predominantly northerly to a more varied pattern, including southerly and westerly directions, which could influence coastal fog dispersion and the movement of local weather systems.
