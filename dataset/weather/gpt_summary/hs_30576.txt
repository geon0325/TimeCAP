Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable decrease in temperature, followed by a gradual increase, suggesting a typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels have shown a significant increase, reaching saturation at one point, which could suggest the presence of fog or heavy dew, particularly during the cooler early morning hours. Air pressure has been relatively stable, with a slight declining trend towards the end of the period, indicating the possibility of an approaching weather system. Wind speeds have remained light to moderate throughout, with some variability in wind direction, mostly shifting between southeasterly and easterly, which is common for coastal areas like Houston.
