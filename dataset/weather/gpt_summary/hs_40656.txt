Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has exhibited an upward trend, starting off relatively cooler and gradually increasing to reach its peak in the latter part of the period. Humidity levels began high but decreased significantly as temperatures rose, suggesting a pattern of morning moisture giving way to drier conditions during the day. Air pressure has been on a slight decline, indicating the potential for changing weather patterns or the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds have been mostly light to moderate without significant gusts, and the prevailing wind direction has been predominantly from the north to northeast, with a notable shift to easterly winds in the final hour. The combination of increasing temperatures, decreasing humidity, and falling air pressure could suggest the approach of a frontal system, leading to possible changes in weather conditions in the near term.
