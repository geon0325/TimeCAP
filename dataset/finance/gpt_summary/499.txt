The VIX has remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting that market volatility has been moderate, ending slightly lower at 21.91 from an initial value of 23.31, which could signal a steady market sentiment. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 exhibited an upward trend, with the Nikkei showing substantial growth, which may reflect a positive outlook in Asian and European markets. Gold futures, often seen as a safe-haven asset, experienced an initial rise followed by a slight decline, closing at 1855.70, which could indicate a shift in investor preference towards riskier assets amidst a more stable market. Crude Oil Futures have generally trended upwards, signaling a potential recovery in energy demand, while the currency markets have seen minor fluctuations in the EUR/USD and USD/JPY pairs, and a slight strengthening of the USD against the CNY, which may point towards a modest recovery of the US dollar in the reviewed period.
