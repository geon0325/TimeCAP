Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates a consistent exceedance of the 2.9% benchmark for Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases, suggesting a sustained period of high influenza activity. The peak of ILI activity was observed mid-series with a ratio of 6.90%, which has since demonstrated a gradual decline, reaching the lowest point of 2.82% in the most recent week. The age groups 0-4 and 25-49 years have shown the highest numbers of ILI cases throughout the period, indicating these populations are particularly affected and may require focused healthcare resources. Despite the recent downtrend in ILI ratios, the prolonged period of elevated ILI activity could have put a significant strain on healthcare services, including increased demand for medical consultations and potential hospitalizations. The observed decline in the most recent weeks could signal the tail end of the influenza season, yet continued surveillance is necessary to manage and respond to any potential resurgence.
