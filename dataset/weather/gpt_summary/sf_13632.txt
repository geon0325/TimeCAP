Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperature exhibited a typical diurnal pattern, with the lowest values around dawn and steadily increasing to peak in the late afternoon before cooling off again. Humidity levels fluctuated, remaining moderate during the day but showed a significant spike towards the end of the period, which could suggest the development of foggy conditions, especially given the city's coastal location. Air pressure remained stable for much of the time but experienced a sharp decrease recently, indicating the potential arrival of a weather system that could bring changes such as increased wind speeds or precipitation. Wind speeds varied, with stronger gusts in the early hours gradually calming towards the evening; however, a modest increase was observed later on. Wind direction was predominantly from the west with occasional shifts, which is typical for the region due to its prevailing westerly winds off the Pacific Ocean.
