The ILI data over the last 20 weeks shows a substantial initial burden on the healthcare system with the ratio of ILI patients substantially exceeding the baseline threshold, indicating a high level of influenza-like illness activity. However, there has been a marked decline in the incidence of ILI across all age groups, with the most significant decreases observed in the youngest age bracket (0-4 years), which initially had the highest numbers. This decline has brought the ratio of ILI patients below the baseline, suggesting a reduction in influenza-like illnesses and potential easing of the strain on healthcare resources. Despite this overall decline, there has been a slight uptick in the ratio of ILI patients in recent weeks, which requires monitoring to assess if this is an early sign of another wave or a minor fluctuation. The healthcare system should remain vigilant and continue preventive and response measures, especially focusing on the most affected age groups, to manage potential increases in ILI cases.
