Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced relatively stable and warm temperatures with minor fluctuations, indicative of typical warm conditions for the region. Humidity levels showed a slight increasing trend overnight, which could have contributed to a muggy feeling in the early hours, but these levels began to decrease as the day progressed, potentially providing some relief. Atmospheric pressure remained fairly constant throughout the day, suggesting stable weather patterns without significant changes in weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally light and showed little variation, indicating a calm wind pattern that would not contribute to any significant wind chill effect or dispersion of atmospheric pollutants. Wind directions varied throughout the day but predominantly came from the south to south-west, which is typical for this region and could be associated with the transportation of warmer air masses.
