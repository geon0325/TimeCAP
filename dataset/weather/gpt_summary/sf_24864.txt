Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures experienced a moderate decrease overnight before warming up again during the day, indicative of a typical diurnal pattern. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with notably higher values during the cooler early morning hours, which could have led to morning fog or dew. Air pressure remained relatively stable for most of the period but showed a substantial drop followed by a sharp increase, which could suggest the passage of a transient weather system through the area. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with the wind direction shifting predominantly between westerly and northerly, which is common for coastal cities like San Francisco and could influence coastal fog patterns. Overall, the weather conditions appear to be fairly stable with no extreme variations, but the brief pressure changes could have been associated with short-term weather events such as passing fronts or localized wind shifts.
