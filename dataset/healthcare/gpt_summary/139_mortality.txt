Over the past 20 weeks, there has been an upward trend in the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, starting at 5.01% and increasing to 7.64%, surpassing the average ratio of 7.84% in the last three weeks. The total number of deaths has fluctuated, with a notable increase in the last four weeks, reaching a peak of 60,588 in week 19. The number of deaths from Influenza has seen a sharp rise in the latter part of the time series, with a dramatic increase from 51 deaths in week 15 to 465 deaths in week 20. Deaths from Pneumonia have also increased over the 20-week period, although the rise has been more gradual compared to Influenza, starting at 2,583 and ending at 4,057. This significant rise in mortality due to Influenza and Pneumonia indicates a growing impact on the healthcare system, which may require increased resources and public health interventions to manage the surge and prevent further escalation.
