Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced relatively stable temperatures with a mild decrease during the night, which is typical for coastal cities. Humidity levels remained consistently high throughout the period, indicating a potential for marine-layer clouds or fog, especially during the early morning hours. The air pressure saw a significant drop at one point, which could be associated with the passage of a weather front, possibly leading to changes in weather patterns such as increased wind speeds or precipitation. Speaking of wind, there was variability in both speed and direction, with a noticeable increase in wind speed towards the end of the period, suggesting the arrival of a more dynamic weather system. The predominant wind direction shifted from northerly to a more southerly direction by the end of the 24-hour period, which could influence temperature and moisture transport in the region.
