Over the last 24 hours in New York City, there has been a notable increase in temperature, reaching a peak during the latter part of the observed period. Humidity levels have fluctuated significantly but have generally stayed within a moderate to high range, which could contribute to a feeling of mugginess. Air pressure has experienced some variability, with a notable dip followed by a gradual return to higher levels, potentially indicating the passage of a weather front through the area. Wind speeds have remained relatively light and consistent throughout the period, with no significant gusts that would impact conditions severely. The wind direction has shifted throughout the day, primarily coming from the southwest and gradually turning to a more northwesterly direction, which could be associated with the movement of weather systems across the region.
