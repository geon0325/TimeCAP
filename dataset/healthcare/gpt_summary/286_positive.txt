Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a fluctuation in the number of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with an average positivity rate of 6.26%. The ratio of specimens testing positive for Influenza A decreased overall, starting at 0.04% and ending at 0.02%, while Influenza B showed a peak positivity ratio of 0.09% in week 9 before ending at 0.03%. A notable spike in the positivity ratio for both Influenza A and B occurred between weeks 7 and 9, reaching up to 0.15% combined, which suggests a potential seasonal peak. Despite these variations, the last week showed a decrease in positivity rates for both strains, with the overall positivity ratio dropping to 0.05%, which is below the average rate. This trend could indicate a potential decline in influenza activity, but continuous monitoring is essential to confirm this trajectory and manage healthcare resources effectively.
