Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced relatively stable temperatures with minor fluctuations, indicating a period of steady weather without significant warming or cooling trends. Humidity levels have remained high, frequently reaching saturation, suggesting a likelihood of fog or mist, particularly during the early morning and late evening hours, which is common for coastal areas like San Francisco. Air pressure has seen a slight but steady increase, which typically signals more settled weather and could lead to clearer skies in the following hours or days. Wind speeds have been light to gentle, decreasing over the day, which would have done little to disperse the high humidity levels, possibly allowing for the persistence of any fog or low clouds. The wind direction has generally been from the south, gradually shifting to a more southeasterly direction, which is consistent with the maritime influence on San Francisco's weather pattern.
