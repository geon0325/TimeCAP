Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced a relatively stable temperature pattern, with a noticeable peak indicating a warm spell before a subsequent sharp decrease, which could suggest the passage of a frontal system. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, starting high, decreasing during the warmest part of the day, and then spiking again, which is typical behavior as temperatures and humidity often exhibit an inverse relationship. Air pressure showed an overall increase towards the end of the period, which typically indicates improving weather conditions and the possible arrival of a high-pressure system. Wind speeds were generally light but did show some periods of increased activity, hinting at transient weather systems passing through the area. The wind direction was predominantly steady, with a few shifts that corresponded with changes in temperature and pressure, suggesting variable wind patterns associated with changing weather conditions.
