Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has experienced significant volatility, with a notable drop to 2237.40 followed by a recovery, ending the period slightly lower at 2488.65, indicating ongoing market uncertainty. The VIX, or Volatility Index, confirmed this heightened uncertainty with levels consistently above historical averages, peaking at 82.69, and has since declined to 46.80, suggesting a potential stabilization of market sentiment. International indices such as Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 also reflected similar volatility, with the Nikkei 225 showing a degree of recovery from its lows and the FTSE 100 ending the 20-day period lower, underscoring the global impact of current events. Gold Futures initially dropped to 1515.70 but rebounded to close at 1633.70, highlighting its status as a perceived safe-haven asset during times of market turbulence. Crude Oil Futures plunged to a low of 20.37 before recovering to 28.34, and exchange rates experienced fluctuations, particularly a weakening of the USD against the JPY and a relatively stable but slightly weaker USD against the EUR and CNY, reflecting broader economic uncertainty and currency market reactions to global monetary policy responses.
