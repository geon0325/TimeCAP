Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable increase in the ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia compared to the total number of deaths, starting at 6.54% and escalating to 12.56%, significantly higher than the 20-week average of 7.84%. This increase coincides with a rise in the absolute number of deaths attributed to both Influenza and Pneumonia, with deaths from Pneumonia showing a substantial jump from 3816 to 8985, and Influenza-related deaths rising from 23 to 56 in the final week. The total number of deaths also increased towards the end of the time series, peaking at 71984 in the last week, which may suggest a worsening overall mortality trend. The spike in the mortality ratio during the last five weeks to values well above the average indicates a potential healthcare stress, with Pneumonia being the primary contributor. The data suggests the need for increased healthcare resources and prevention measures, particularly for Pneumonia, to manage this upward trend in mortality.
