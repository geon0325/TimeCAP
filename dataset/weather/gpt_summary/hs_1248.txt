Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature exhibited a diurnal pattern, with a typical decrease overnight followed by a significant rise during the day, suggesting clear or partly cloudy conditions which allowed for solar heating. Humidity levels were variable, with a notable increase during the nighttime hours reaching saturation, consistent with the formation of dew or fog, and then decreasing significantly as temperatures rose, possibly due to daytime heating dispersing moisture. Air pressure remained relatively stable and high throughout the period, indicating a likelihood of sustained fair weather. Wind speeds were mostly light and variable, with an increase later in the day, which could contribute to a slight cooling effect or the dispersion of humidity. The predominant wind direction varied, with periods of calm interspersed with southerly and easterly winds, which in Houston can often bring in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, affecting local humidity levels.
