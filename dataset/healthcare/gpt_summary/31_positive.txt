Over the past 20 weeks, the data indicates a fluctuating trend in the number of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the overall average positivity ratio being 6.26%. The highest positivity ratio was observed in the first week at 6.69%, with a notable decline to the lowest point of 0.78% in week 12, before rising again to 1.74% in the final week. The ratio of Influenza A positive specimens has generally decreased from 1.99% to 1.03%, suggesting a downward trend for this strain, while Influenza B showed a more pronounced decrease from 4.70% to 0.71%, indicating a significant reduction in its prevalence. Despite these declines, there was a rebound in positivity rates for both strains towards the end of the period, which could signal a potential resurgence that healthcare providers should monitor closely. The overall decrease in positive cases, particularly for Influenza B, may have eased some pressures on the healthcare system but the recent uptick requires attention to prevent further strain.
