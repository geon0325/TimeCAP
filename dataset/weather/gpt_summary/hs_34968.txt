Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures have followed a typical diurnal pattern, starting relatively warm in the early hours, cooling towards the morning, and then increasing to peak in the late afternoon. Humidity levels have shown significant variation, starting at moderate levels before rising overnight, which is common as temperatures decrease, and then dropping markedly during the peak afternoon heat. Atmospheric pressure has remained relatively stable, with only minor fluctuations that indicate stable weather conditions without the immediate approach of significant weather fronts or systems. Wind speeds have been consistently light, suggesting a calm weather pattern without significant wind-related weather events. Wind directions have been variable, with a notable shift from northerly to northwesterly directions, and a brief period of easterly winds, which could indicate the passage of a minor weather system or the influence of local land-sea breezes.
