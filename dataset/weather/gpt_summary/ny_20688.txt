Over the last 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual decline in temperature, reaching its lowest point at the end of the observed period. Humidity levels remained relatively high throughout the day, suggesting a potential for a damp and chilly atmosphere that could affect comfort levels outdoors. Air pressure showed an increasing trend initially, peaking in the middle of the time span, but it then reversed into a decreasing pattern, which may indicate an approaching weather system or front. Wind speeds were mostly light and showed a decrease towards the latter part of the period, with the wind eventually becoming calm. The wind direction shifted significantly from northerly to easterly and then to southeasterly by the end of the period, which could bring changes in weather conditions, such as a possible increase in temperature or incoming moisture from the Atlantic.
