Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a slight increase in temperature which peaked during the afternoon before gradually declining towards the evening, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels varied significantly, reaching saturation during the early morning hours which could have led to fog or dew formation, followed by drier conditions in the afternoon, possibly enhancing comfort levels. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, suggesting a steady weather pattern without the immediate influence of strong frontal systems. Wind speeds were mostly moderate but showed some variability, with calmer conditions around midday and slightly breezier conditions in the evening, which may have influenced the dispersion of pollutants and provided some relief from the heat. The wind direction was predominantly from the south to southeast, typical for Houston, bringing warmer air from the Gulf of Mexico which can contribute to higher humidity and temperatures.
