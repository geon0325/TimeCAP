Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced relatively stable temperatures with a minor fluctuation that could be characteristic of diurnal variation. Humidity levels have remained consistently high, suggesting a significant amount of moisture in the air, which could lead to a muggy feeling and potentially contribute to cloud formation or precipitation if conditions permit. The air pressure has seen some variability with a notable increase, indicating the potential influence of a high-pressure system that could lead to clearer skies and calmer weather conditions. Wind speeds have generally been low, implying a period of calm weather, though there have been slight increases at times which should not significantly affect the overall weather pattern. Lastly, the wind direction has shown variability but has largely been from the southerly and easterly directions, which in Houston could contribute to the transportation of moist Gulf air inland, potentially reinforcing the existing humidity.
