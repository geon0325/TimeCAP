Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature with a general trend of warming, particularly notable during the latter part of the timeframe. Humidity levels showed significant variance, reaching saturation at certain points, which could indicate the presence of fog or mist, especially during times when temperature differences were minimal. Air pressure varied with a noticeable drop followed by a sharp increase towards the end of the period, suggesting the passage of a weather front and potential changes in weather conditions. Wind speeds were mostly gentle to moderate but showed some increase later on, which could contribute to cooler perceived temperatures and the dispersal of any humidity or fog. Wind direction shifted throughout the day, primarily from southerly to westerly, which is typical of changing weather patterns that might bring different air masses into the region.
