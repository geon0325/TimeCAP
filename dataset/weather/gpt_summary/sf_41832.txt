Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a gradual increase in temperature, reaching a peak in the latest readings, indicative of a warming trend. Humidity levels have varied significantly, with very high levels during the cooler early hours, and then dropping sharply during the warmer part of the day before rising again, suggesting a cycle of moisture in the air that correlates with temperature changes. Air pressure experienced a noticeable drop in the middle of the time series but has since stabilized, which could have been associated with transient weather systems passing through the area. Wind speeds have been mostly light and consistent, with a slight increase observed later in the period, potentially affecting the dispersion of air pollutants and contributing to changes in temperature and humidity. Wind direction shifts were observed, including a period where the wind direction swung to come from the east before predominantly settling back to a southerly and then westerly direction, possibly influencing the movement of marine air masses and coastal weather conditions.
