Over the last 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have shown a typical diurnal pattern with a peak during the daytime and a drop at night, but overall they remained within a comfortable range. Humidity levels varied significantly, reaching their highest in the early morning hours which could have led to morning mist or fog, a common occurrence in the region. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with a slight decrease towards the end of the 24-hour window, which might indicate the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds were moderate, with some gusts that may have felt brisk at times; the prevailing winds came from a westerly direction, which is typical for San Francisco's maritime climate. The combination of these factors suggests stable weather likely to be enjoyed by residents and visitors, with the possibility of some fog during the early hours, and no immediate signs of major weather disturbances.
