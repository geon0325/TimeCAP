Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable drop in temperature, indicating a cool down after what appears to have been a warmer start. Humidity levels remained high throughout the day, peaking in the early hours, which may have contributed to a muggy feel in the air, potentially leading to discomfort or exacerbating certain weather-sensitive conditions. Air pressure experienced a gradual increase, suggesting a likely stabilization of the current weather pattern or the onset of clearer skies. Wind speed varied moderately, with some brisk winds earlier in the period calming down later on, which might have provided some relief from the high humidity. Wind direction shifted significantly from initially southerly to northerly directions, indicating a frontal passage that could be responsible for the observed changes in temperature and pressure.
