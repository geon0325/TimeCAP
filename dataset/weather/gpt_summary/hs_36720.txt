Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before slightly declining. Humidity levels have shown some fluctuations but remained relatively moderate, with a notable spike in the early morning hours, likely contributing to a feeling of increased mugginess. Air pressure has been steadily high but has shown a gradual decrease, indicating a potential change in weather patterns or the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds have been mostly light to gentle, with a slight increase towards the latter part of the day, and the wind direction has been predominantly from the north to northeast, shifting towards the east. These conditions suggest stable weather but the decreasing air pressure could signal a transition to more dynamic weather in the near future.
