The time-series data on respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza indicates a significant decrease in the incidence of positive tests over the last 20 weeks, with a peak ratio of positive specimens at 28.32% in week 1, which has sharply declined to 0.21% by week 20. Influenza A showed a similar trend, starting at a high of 19.50% and falling to 0.13%, suggesting a substantial reduction in its prevalence. Influenza B also exhibited a decrease, though less pronounced, from an 8.83% positivity rate to 0.08% in the same period. Despite the overall average positivity rate being 6.26%, the current rate is significantly below this average, indicating a possible end of the influenza season or effective control measures. These trends likely indicate a decreased burden on the healthcare system for influenza cases but warrant continued surveillance to manage and prepare for potential future outbreaks.
