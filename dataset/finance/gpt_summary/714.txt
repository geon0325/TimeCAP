International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 experienced declines, with the Nikkei showing a pronounced drop, which may reflect regional economic concerns or global market pressures. Gold Futures remained relatively stable with a slight downward trend, indicating that investors may not be significantly increasing their safe-haven assets despite stock market fluctuations.
