Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a slight decline in temperature before it gradually increased, indicating a typical diurnal variation with cooler conditions overnight transitioning to warmer conditions during the day. Humidity levels were inversely correlated with temperature changes, starting lower, increasing significantly during the cooler early hours, and then decreasing as the temperature rose through the day, which could have affected the comfort levels with higher humidity being perceived as muggier conditions. Air pressure showed a slight decreasing trend overall, which could suggest a change in weather patterns or the approach of a weather system. Wind speeds varied moderately but remained mostly gentle to moderate with some increase during the day, which is typical for coastal areas and can contribute to changes in temperature and humidity. The wind direction was variable throughout the day, with notable shifts from southwesterly to easterly and then to westerly and northerly directions, reflecting the dynamic nature of coastal wind patterns in San Francisco.
