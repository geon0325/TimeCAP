Over the last 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature, exhibiting a typical diurnal pattern with a peak during the daytime hours and a drop at night. Humidity levels have shown significant variability, with higher values recorded during the early morning hours, indicative of a possible morning mist or fog, which then decreased as temperatures rose. Air pressure has remained relatively stable with a slight dip, suggesting stable weather conditions; however, the slight pressure drop could be associated with a transient weather system moving through the area. Wind speeds have been consistently low, suggesting a calm period with little air movement, but a sudden increase in wind speed was noted, which could signal a change in weather patterns. The wind direction has been variable, shifting from primarily southerly to easterly and northerly directions, which may influence temperature and humidity levels due to the different air masses being ushered into the region.
