Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, indicating a warming trend. Humidity levels showed variability with a significant rise towards the end of the period, reaching saturation, which could suggest the potential for fog or precipitation. Air pressure has been on a consistent decline, which is often associated with the approach of a low-pressure system, possibly leading to changing weather conditions. Wind speeds varied slightly but remained generally light to gentle, with a notable increase in the evening hours. The wind direction shifted throughout the day, predominantly coming from the south to southwest, which may have contributed to the gradual warming observed in the temperature trend.
