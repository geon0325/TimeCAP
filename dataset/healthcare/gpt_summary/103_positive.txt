Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a marked increase in the proportion of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the ratio of positive specimens rising from 1.70% to 27.00%. The number of specimens tested weekly increased steadily, peaking at 81,391 in week 20, indicating a significant scale-up in testing efforts. Influenza A has been the predominant strain throughout the period, though its proportion of positive specimens has decreased from a peak of 22.19% in week 16 to 17.34% in week 20, while Influenza B has shown an opposite trend, increasing its share from 0.57% to 9.65% over the same period. The substantial growth in positive cases for both influenza types, especially the rapid rise of Influenza B in recent weeks, suggests a potentially heightened burden on healthcare resources. These trends highlight the need for continued vigilance, resource allocation for patient care, and possibly increased public health measures to manage the spread of influenza.
