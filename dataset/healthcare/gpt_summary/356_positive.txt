Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant increase in the ratio of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a rise from 0.49% to a peak of 26.27% before slightly decreasing to 24.47%. The number of positive specimens for Influenza A has increased dramatically, indicating that it is the predominant subtype, with its ratio growing from 0.44% to 24.34%. Influenza B has shown a relatively stable presence without dramatic fluctuations, maintaining a ratio of around 0.05% to 0.12%. The peak positivity rate for Influenza A at week 19 suggests that healthcare systems may have faced increased demand for medical care and antiviral medications during this period. Given the substantial uptick in influenza activity, public health measures and resource allocation for the healthcare system should be reviewed to manage the high influx of flu cases effectively.
