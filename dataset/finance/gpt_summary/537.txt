Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has fluctuated but ultimately showed a slight upward trend, closing higher at 3915.46 from an initial 3906.71. The VIX has generally trended downwards, indicating a reduction in market volatility, though it experienced a recent uptick to 21.58, suggesting increased uncertainty. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 indices both display overall growth, with the Nikkei closing notably higher at 30216.75, reflecting investor confidence in the Asian markets and potential economic recovery signals in the UK. Gold futures, while seeing some volatility, ended slightly lower, suggesting that investors may be shifting towards riskier assets as gold typically serves as a safe-haven investment.
