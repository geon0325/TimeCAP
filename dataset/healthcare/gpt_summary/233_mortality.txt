Over the last 20 weeks, there has been an upward trend in the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia relative to total deaths, starting at 5.91% and peaking at 16.83% before settling at a higher-than-average 10.54% in the last observed week. This peak surpasses the 20-week average mortality ratio of 7.84% by a significant margin, indicating a period of heightened impact from these respiratory conditions. The total number of deaths attributed to Influenza remained relatively low, with a slight increase towards the end, while deaths from Pneumonia showed a more pronounced surge, particularly from week 5 onwards, with an increase from 5094 to a peak of 12316 deaths in week 10. The data suggests a substantial burden on the healthcare system, likely requiring increased resources for treatment and prevention measures. After week 10, a gradual decline in the mortality ratio is observed, yet it remains above the average, suggesting a sustained strain on healthcare services and the need for continued vigilance and resource allocation.
