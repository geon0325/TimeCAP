Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has shown a gradual decline before slightly rebounding towards the end of the period, indicating a mild cooling trend with a slight warming reversal. Humidity levels have remained high throughout, with a peak at full saturation, suggesting potential for fog or dew formation, particularly during the coolest hours. Air pressure was relatively stable with a slight overall decrease, which could indicate a weak weather system moving through the area.
