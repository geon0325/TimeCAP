Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a general downward trend in the ratio of mortality due to Influenza or Pneumonia compared to total deaths, decreasing from a high of 10.72% in the third week to a low of 5.20% in the eleventh week, before rising again to 5.99% in the most recent week. Despite the overall decline in this ratio, the absolute number of deaths from Influenza has increased in recent weeks, with a noticeable jump from 66 to 101 deaths between the penultimate and the last week. In contrast, deaths from Pneumonia have shown a decrease from the beginning of the time series, with a slight uptick in the last reported week. The initial figures surpass the average ratio of 7.84% for mortality from these conditions but have since fallen below this benchmark, indicating a possible seasonal pattern or the impact of public health interventions. The recent rise in Influenza deaths, despite the overall lower ratio, could signal the beginning of a new trend that requires close monitoring and potentially targeted healthcare responses.
