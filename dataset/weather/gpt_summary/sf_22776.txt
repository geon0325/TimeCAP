Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperature exhibited a slight diurnal variation, with a gentle rise during the day followed by a modest decrease at night, indicative of stable weather conditions without any extreme changes. Humidity levels were very high, particularly during the night and early morning, reaching full saturation, which could have resulted in foggy conditions that are typical for the San Francisco area. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively constant, with only minor fluctuations, suggesting that the weather is likely to stay stable without the immediate approach of any significant weather systems. Wind speeds were generally light and exhibited very little variation, which would not contribute to any substantial wind chill effect or dispersion of fog and low clouds. The dominant wind direction was from the southwest, which is common for the region and can bring in marine air, potentially contributing to the high humidity levels experienced.
