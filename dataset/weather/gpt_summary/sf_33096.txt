Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual increase in temperature from the early hours, reaching a peak in the late afternoon before a slight dip in the evening, indicative of typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels showed significant fluctuation; starting relatively high, dropping considerably during peak afternoon temperatures, and then rising again, possibly affecting the comfort levels throughout the day. Air pressure remained fairly steady with a slight increase towards the middle of the day, suggesting stable weather conditions, although there was a notable drop towards the evening which could signal a change in the weather pattern. Wind speeds varied, with a period of higher gusts around the morning hours, calming down thereafter but picking up again in the evening, which may have an impact on evening activities and conditions at sea. Wind direction was predominantly westerly, consistent with the maritime influence on San Francisco's climate, but it also showed variability with occasional shifts which could lead to changes in temperature and cloud cover.
