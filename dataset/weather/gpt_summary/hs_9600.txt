Over the last 24 hours, Houston experienced a slight decrease in temperature, marking a gradual cooling trend. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with the highest values occurring during the cooler early morning hours, indicative of a muggy atmosphere that likely resulted in a heavy dew or fog formation. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable with a minor fluctuation, suggesting steady weather conditions without the immediate approach of a significant weather system. Wind speeds reduced to a calm breeze, providing little relief from the humidity, and the wind direction was variable, though predominantly it came from the southeast before a notable shift to a northerly direction and then returning to a southeasterly flow. This combination of high humidity, stable pressure, and low wind speeds is typical for Houston's subtropical climate, which may result in continued muggy conditions without a strong weather disturbance.
