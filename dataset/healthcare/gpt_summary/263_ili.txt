The analysis of the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data over the last 20 weeks indicates a declining trend in the ratio of ILI patients, with recent numbers falling below the baseline threshold. Early weeks showed a higher incidence among all age groups, particularly in the youngest (0-4) and school-aged (5-24) populations, which could have indicated a strain on pediatric healthcare resources. However, as the weeks progressed, there was a marked decrease in ILI incidence across all age groups, with the most significant reductions observed in the youngest cohort. The declining trend in ILI ratios suggests a reduction in the immediate burden on healthcare services related to influenza, potentially freeing up resources for other pressing healthcare needs. Despite the current decrease in ILI cases, continuous monitoring is essential to respond to any possible resurgence and to manage seasonal fluctuations effectively.
