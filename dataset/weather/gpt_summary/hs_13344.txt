Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature followed by a mild decrease, indicating typical diurnal variation with warmer conditions during the day transitioning to slightly cooler temperatures at night. The humidity levels started moderately high and increased to very high levels during the night and early morning hours, which could have contributed to a feeling of mugginess and potentially impacted visibility or resulted in morning dew. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable, with only minor fluctuations throughout the period, signifying stable weather conditions without the immediate approach of significant weather fronts or systems. Wind speeds varied from calm to moderate breezes, with the highest speeds observed in the late evening, which could have influenced the dispersion of humidity and provided some relief from the heat. Wind direction was predominantly from the south to southeast, which is typical for Houston and may have contributed to the transportation of moist air from the Gulf of Mexico, reinforcing the humidity trend observed.
