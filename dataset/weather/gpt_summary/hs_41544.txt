Over the past 24 hours, Houston experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature, with a general trend of warming during the day followed by a mild cooling at night. Humidity levels varied significantly, reaching their highest near dawn and dropping around midday, which could indicate the presence of morning fog or dew, followed by drier conditions. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with only minor variations, which suggests a steady weather pattern without the immediate likelihood of significant weather changes such as storms. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with an increase observed later in the period, which might contribute to a slight cooling effect and dispersion of any humidity or pollution. The wind direction shifted throughout the day, starting predominantly from the east and gradually moving to blow from the south, which is typical for coastal cities like Houston and can influence local temperature and humidity levels.
