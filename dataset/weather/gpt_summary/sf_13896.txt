Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperature with a noticeable increase during the midday hours before returning to values similar to those at the start of the day. Humidity levels showed a significant increase during the early morning, indicative of possible morning fog or mist, which is common in this region, but these levels decreased toward the afternoon, suggesting clearer conditions. Air pressure varied throughout the day but showed a general decrease, which could be associated with the arrival of a weather system that may affect local conditions. Wind speeds were moderate and decreased significantly towards the afternoon, becoming very light or calm, which could lead to a build-up of air pollutants in the absence of dispersion mechanisms. Furthermore, wind direction demonstrated notable variability, including a drastic shift to a northeasterly direction, which could influence coastal weather patterns and potentially bring in different air masses affecting local weather conditions.
