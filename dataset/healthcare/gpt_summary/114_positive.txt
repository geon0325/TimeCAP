Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable decline in the ratio of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a peak positivity rate of 27.37% in week 7 declining to 8.00% by week 20. Influenza A has consistently been the predominant strain, though its share of positive specimens has decreased from a peak of 21.62% to 2.44% in the same timeframe, indicating a significant reduction in its spread. In contrast, Influenza B showed an initial increase in the proportion of positive specimens, reaching a high of 10.95% by week 10, but has since decreased to 5.56% by week 20. The overall reduction in positive specimens for both Influenza A and B suggests a waning influenza season; however, the healthcare system must remain vigilant for potential fluctuations. These trends are important for guiding public health interventions, vaccine development, and resource allocation in anticipation of future influenza seasons.
