Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, peaking during the late afternoon before slightly decreasing towards the evening. Humidity levels showed significant variation, with a peak during the early morning hours, indicative of possible dawn-related moisture, and a sharp decline through the afternoon, which is typical for warmer conditions. The air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight downward trend towards the end of the period, suggesting a possible change in weather patterns that could affect local conditions in the near future.
