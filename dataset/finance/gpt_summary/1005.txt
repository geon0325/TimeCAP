Over the past 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a general uptrend, increasing from 3783.22 to 4060.43, indicating a recovering sentiment among investors. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, has trended downwards from 22.14 to 18.73, suggesting that investor fear is subsiding, which typically correlates with rising equity markets. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have also exhibited upward momentum, with the Nikkei 225 rebounding from a low of 25716.86 to 27362.75, and the FTSE 100 climbing steadily to 7761.10, reflecting a positive outlook in global markets. Gold futures have seen a slight increase from 1807.90 to 1929.10, which may signal investor caution and a hedge against potential market risks. The exchange rates show the USD weakening against both the EUR and the JPY, but holding steady against the CNY, indicating shifts in currency strengths that could affect international trade dynamics and cross-border investment flows.
