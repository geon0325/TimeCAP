Over the last 20 weeks, the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data indicates a general downward trend in both the total number of patients seen and the number of ILI cases across all age groups. The percentage of patients presenting with ILI symptoms has consistently remained below the baseline of 2.9%, suggesting a relatively mild influenza season thus far. The most significant reductions in ILI cases have been observed in the youngest age group (0-4 years), which may reflect the high transmissibility of illnesses in this demographic and potentially the effectiveness of public health measures and vaccinations. While the decrease in ILI cases may have lessened the immediate burden on the healthcare system, continuous monitoring is essential to prepare for potential surges or shifts in trends. The stable or slightly declining ratio of ILI patients in recent weeks should be interpreted with caution, as influenza patterns can change rapidly, warranting readiness for increased healthcare demand.
