Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced stable temperatures with a slight fluctuation, staying within a narrow range indicative of consistent weather patterns. Humidity levels remained extremely high throughout the day, suggesting a very moist atmosphere which could lead to a feeling of mugginess and discomfort for residents. Air pressure was notably high and showed minimal variation, which is often associated with settled weather and is likely to have contributed to the lack of temperature variability. Wind speeds were generally light and exhibited little change, which would have done little to mitigate the humidity. Wind direction varied significantly, suggesting shifting winds that could have led to changes in local weather conditions, such as cloud cover and precipitation patterns.
