Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual increase in temperature which peaked during the late afternoon, followed by a subtle decline towards the evening. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly throughout the day, with notable peaks in the early morning and late evening, suggesting the presence of moisture-laden air masses during those times. Air pressure remained relatively stable and high, indicating settled weather conditions without significant short-term changes. Wind speeds were variable, with periods of calmer winds interspersed with gustier conditions, particularly during the early hours and again towards the end of the day. The predominant wind direction was westerly, with some variation, which is typical for the region and could contribute to the advection of marine air inland, impacting local climate conditions.
