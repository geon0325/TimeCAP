Over the last 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a gradual decrease in temperature, reaching its lowest point close to early morning hours and then rising back up towards the late afternoon. Humidity levels have experienced notable fluctuations, with a significant increase during nighttime that tapered off during the day, likely contributing to cooler morning conditions and a drier atmosphere by afternoon. Air pressure remained relatively stable with slight variations, but there was a noticeable drop in the late evening, which could potentially lead to changes in the weather pattern such as increased wind speeds or a shift in weather conditions. Wind speeds varied considerably, with gusty conditions observed at times; however, they mostly stayed moderate and calmed down towards the latter part of the period. The wind direction has been predominantly westerly with some variability, suggesting that oceanic influences could be affecting the local weather conditions, bringing in cooler air from over the Pacific.
