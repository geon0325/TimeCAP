Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, peaking in the late afternoon before slightly declining in the evening. Relative humidity levels were high in the early hours but showed a significant decrease as the day progressed, potentially leading to more comfortable conditions for residents. Air pressure has been on a slow decline throughout the period, which might suggest an approaching weather system or front. Wind speeds varied, with stronger winds occurring during the day which then weakened towards the evening, while the prevailing wind direction shifted from southeasterly to southerly and then to southwesterly by the close of the day. This combination of dropping air pressure, varying wind speeds, and shifting wind direction could indicate changing weather conditions, possibly heralding the arrival of a new weather system in the near future.
