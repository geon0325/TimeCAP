Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with notably higher levels during the early morning that decreased as temperatures rose, indicating a typical diurnal pattern. Air pressure showed a slight decreasing trend throughout the period, which could suggest the approach of a weather system that may lead to changing weather conditions soon. Wind speeds varied moderately with some hours experiencing calm conditions and others breezier moments, with a notable increase towards the late afternoon and evening, possibly contributing to a perceived drop in temperature due to wind chill.
