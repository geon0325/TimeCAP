Over the past day, San Francisco has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, reaching its lowest point in the early morning hours before rising again towards the afternoon. Humidity levels have shown variability but have largely remained high, suggesting a likelihood of persistent moisture in the air. Air pressure has seen some fluctuations, with a notable increase during the early morning, which could be indicative of a transient high-pressure system affecting the area. Wind speeds were generally light and exhibited only minor changes throughout the day, while wind direction shifted significantly, indicating the passage of different air masses over the region. Overall, the weather pattern suggests a cool and moist environment, with the potential for fog or low clouds, particularly during times when humidity peaked alongside lower temperatures and stable air pressure.
