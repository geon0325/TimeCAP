Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant increase in the rate of positive respiratory specimens for influenza, with a marked surge in Influenza A cases. The percentage of positive specimens has risen steadily from 1.43% to 25.37%, exceeding the average positive rate of 6.26%. Notably, Influenza A has been the predominant subtype, with its positive rate growing from 0.98% to 21.23%, while Influenza B showed a smaller yet consistent increase from 0.45% to 4.13%. The peak in positive rates coincides with an almost fourfold increase in the number of specimens tested, suggesting a widespread and possibly intensifying flu season. This trend likely indicates a growing burden on healthcare resources, necessitating increased vigilance and potentially greater allocation for influenza management and prevention efforts.
