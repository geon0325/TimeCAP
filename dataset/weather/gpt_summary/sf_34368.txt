Over the last 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a mild decrease in temperatures, following a typical diurnal pattern with cooler conditions overnight before warming up during the day. Humidity levels have fluctuated but remained relatively high, suggesting the presence of moisture in the air which could lead to foggy conditions, particularly in the early hours. Air pressure has been stable, indicating a lack of significant weather systems moving through the area that would disrupt the current weather conditions. Wind speeds have been moderate with some variability, but without any strong gusts, which is common for the region and unlikely to cause any weather-related advisories. The prevailing wind directions have been mostly westerly, which is typical for San Franciscoâ€™s coastal climate, often bringing in marine air and affecting local temperatures.
