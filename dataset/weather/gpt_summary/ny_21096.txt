Over the past 24 hours in New York City, the temperature experienced a noticeable dip before rising again, suggesting a cold front may have passed through the area, followed by a slight warming trend. Humidity levels showed minor fluctuations but generally remained high, indicating a consistent level of moisture in the air which could contribute to a feeling of chilliness despite the actual temperature. Air pressure saw a steady increase throughout the period, which is typically associated with the arrival of fair weather and could signal clearer conditions ahead. Wind speeds were consistently light, which would not contribute much to wind chill factors but could lead to stagnant air conditions in urban areas. The wind direction varied, beginning predominantly northwesterly, shifting westerly, and then veering more to the south, which may influence temperature and humidity changes depending on the origin of the air masses.
