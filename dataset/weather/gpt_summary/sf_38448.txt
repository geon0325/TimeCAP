Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures have remained relatively stable with a slight fluctuation, indicating a consistent weather pattern without significant warm or cold spells. Humidity levels have been high throughout the period, suggesting a damp and possibly overcast climate which could contribute to a feeling of mugginess and may affect those with sensitivities to high humidity. Air pressure has shown a gradual increase followed by a subsequent decrease, indicating the possible passage of a weather front through the area, which could have led to changes in weather conditions such as cloudiness or precipitation levels. Wind speeds have generally been moderate but decreased significantly at one point, suggesting a period of calmer conditions; however, they increased again towards the end of the observed period, hinting at the arrival of a new weather system. Wind direction varied but predominantly came from the south to the south-west, a factor that could influence coastal conditions and temperature moderation from oceanic influences.
