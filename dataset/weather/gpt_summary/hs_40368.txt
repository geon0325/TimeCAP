Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before stabilizing slightly below the day's maximum. Humidity levels have shown significant variation, with a notable dip in the midday hours followed by a sharp increase, indicating potential for muggy conditions that persisted into the evening. The air pressure has been relatively stable, although a slight downward trend in the last few hours could suggest an approaching change in weather patterns. Wind speeds have been mostly light to moderate, but there have been periods of increased wind activity later in the day, which could affect outdoor activities. Wind direction has been variable, predominantly from a southerly direction, which is typical for Houston's climate and can contribute to warmer temperatures and higher humidity.
