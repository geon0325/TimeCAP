Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a noticeable increase in the mortality ratio of Influenza or Pneumonia relative to the total number of deaths, starting at 6.17% and rising to a peak of 15.78% before slightly decreasing to 15.21%. This trend indicates a growing impact of these respiratory diseases on overall mortality, surpassing the 20-week average of 7.84%. The total deaths recorded fluctuated but showed an upward trend, culminating in the final weeks with the highest numbers at 78,946 and 76,697. The number of deaths attributed to Influenza peaked at week 14 with 655 deaths, whereas Pneumonia-related deaths peaked significantly higher at 11,988 in week 18. The increasing ratio of mortality from these conditions suggests a potential strain on healthcare resources and highlights the necessity for enhanced prevention and treatment strategies.
