Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature experienced a moderate fluctuation, peaking during the afternoon and displaying a typical diurnal cooling pattern overnight. Humidity levels varied significantly, reaching saturation in the early morning hours which could have led to fog or dew formation, and then decreasing substantially during the day, indicating drier conditions that may have been more comfortable. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor variations, suggesting a steady atmospheric condition without the immediate approach of significant weather systems. Wind speeds were generally light, with a slight increase towards the end of the period, which could have contributed to a minor wind chill effect during the cooler hours. The wind direction was predominantly from the southeast, shifting briefly to the north, and then stabilizing from the east-southeast, which is typical for sea breezes that could influence local weather patterns including temperature and humidity.
