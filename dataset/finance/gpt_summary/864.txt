The VIX, commonly known as the fear index, has generally stayed elevated, peaking at 34.02 and closing at 26.73, which aligns with increased market uncertainty and potential investor anxiety. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have also shown declines, with the Nikkei falling from 27943.95 to 26107.65 and the FTSE 100 from 7598.90 to 7107.80, indicating a global risk-off mood. Commodities have seen mixed movements; Gold Futures have decreased significantly from 1847.50 to 1734.90, suggesting a decrease in safe-haven demand, while Crude Oil Futures have dropped from 119.41 to 98.53, which could signal concerns about future economic growth. Exchange rates have seen the dollar strengthening against the euro, moving from 1.07 EUR/USD to 1.03, and largely holding steady against the Japanese yen and the Chinese yuan, which may reflect shifting investor preferences towards dollar-denominated assets in times of market stress.
