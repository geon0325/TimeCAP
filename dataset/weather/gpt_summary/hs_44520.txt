Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature experienced a gradual decrease during the night and early morning hours, followed by a significant increase as the day progressed, which is typical for the region's diurnal pattern. Humidity levels showed a sharp spike reaching saturation during the early morning, likely indicative of fog or dew formation, before decreasing and then rising again in the evening. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, with only minor fluctuations, suggesting a period of stable weather conditions. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with a slight uptick towards the end of the period, which could be associated with the passage of a weather system. Wind directions varied but predominantly came from a southerly direction, which is common for Houston, and may have contributed to the warmer temperatures observed during the day.
