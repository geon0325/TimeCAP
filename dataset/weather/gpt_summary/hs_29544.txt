Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, indicating a warming trend. Humidity levels were high during the night and early morning hours, which may have led to a muggy feeling, but there was a significant drop as the temperature rose, suggesting drier conditions later in the day. Air pressure showed a slight overall decrease throughout the period, which could be indicative of an approaching weather system. Wind speeds were moderate but increased slightly towards the end of the period, with notable shifts in wind direction, suggesting variable and potentially unstable atmospheric conditions. The change from southerly to northerly wind directions could imply the passage of a frontal system through the region.
