Humidity levels experienced a varied pattern, starting lower, increasing significantly during the night and early morning, and then decreasing sharply towards the late afternoon, which is consistent with the temperature changes.

Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate throughout the period, with an increase seen in the late afternoon, indicating a possible shift in weather patterns or the presence of a localized pressure system. The wind direction has been predominantly from the northwest, shifting to westerly and occasionally to the southwest, which could have contributed to the variations in temperature and humidity experienced across the city.
