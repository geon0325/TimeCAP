Over the past 20 weeks, the data indicates a progressive increase in the incidence of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) among all age groups, with the most pronounced rise observed in children aged 0-4 and adults aged 25-49. The ratio of ILI patients, initially well below the baseline, has surpassed the threshold in recent weeks, peaking significantly before showing signs of a slight decline. The surge in ILI cases, particularly in the younger and middle-aged populations, suggests a potential strain on pediatric and primary care services. The sharp increase in ILI ratio above the baseline is indicative of an active influenza season, which may necessitate increased healthcare resources and public health interventions. Given the recent peak in ILI activity, continued monitoring is essential to manage healthcare system demands and to inform public health strategies aimed at mitigating the spread of influenza.
