Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a downward trend in the overall number of patients presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI), with a noticeable decline in the ratio of ILI patients, which remained consistently below the baseline of 2.9%. The most significant decrease in ILI occurrence was observed among the age groups 0-4 and 5-24, which traditionally are key vectors for the spread of influenza, indicating a potential reduction in the transmission of the virus within these age cohorts. While there have been slight fluctuations, the ILI ratios in older age groups (ages 25 and above) have remained relatively stable but low, suggesting a contained impact on these demographics. Recently, there has been a slight uptick in the ILI ratio, although it still remains below the epidemic threshold, suggesting a modest increase in ILI activity. This recent increase warrants close monitoring as it may signal the beginning of an upward trend in ILI cases, which could have implications for healthcare resource allocation and public health interventions.
