Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with a slight downward trend, ending marginally lower than its starting point, which may indicate uncertainty among investors. The VIX index, which measures market volatility, has generally increased, reaching a peak midway through the period before settling slightly lower, suggesting increased market volatility and investor anxiety. In contrast, the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 have both shown a decline, potentially reflecting broader global market concerns and regional economic pressures. Commodity prices have fluctuated with Gold Futures rising slightly, indicating a possible shift towards safe-haven assets amidst market uncertainty, whereas Crude Oil Futures have decreased, which could suggest a dampened outlook on global economic activity. Currency exchange rates have remained relatively stable for EUR/USD and USD/CNY, whereas USD/JPY has shown modest weakening of the dollar, which could be indicative of shifting investor sentiment towards the yen as a safer asset.
