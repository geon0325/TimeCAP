Over the last 20 weeks, the proportion of deaths attributed to influenza and pneumonia has consistently remained below the 20-week average of 7.84%, indicating a lower relative impact of these illnesses compared to the historical average. The highest ratio of mortality from Influenza or Pneumonia was 6.54% in the penultimate week, with the lowest at 5.81% in week seven of the time series. Despite fluctuations, there is a slight upward trend in the ratio in the last three weeks, suggesting a potential increase in the impact of these respiratory conditions on overall mortality. The total number of deaths peaked at 59,727 in week 17, while the absolute number of deaths from influenza has significantly decreased over the period, reaching a low of 16 in the final week. Pneumonia deaths, while also varying, have shown less drastic changes week-to-week, staying within a narrower range and ending the period with a high of 3,810, matching the value in week 17, which could indicate a sustained burden of pneumonia on healthcare services.
