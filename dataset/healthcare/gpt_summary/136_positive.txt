Over the past 20 weeks, the testing for influenza has revealed an average positive specimen ratio of 6.26%, with a noticeable fluctuation in the number of specimens tested, ranging from 6,879 to 14,763. Influenza B showed a higher ratio of positive specimens initially, with a peak of 1.81% in the first week, but has since declined to levels consistent with Influenza A, which has a more stable pattern with a slight increase towards the end of the period, peaking at 1.29% in week 18. Overall, the percentage of positive specimens has remained below the average ratio, with a slight uptick in recent weeks, suggesting a potential increase in influenza activity. The consistent presence of both Influenza A and B throughout the 20 weeks indicates ongoing circulation of influenza in the population. Healthcare providers should be alert to the increasing trend and prepared for a possible continued rise in influenza cases, which may require increased resources for testing and treatment.
