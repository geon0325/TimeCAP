Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures exhibited a typical diurnal pattern with a peak during the afternoon and a gradual decrease towards the early hours of the morning. Humidity levels were high, particularly during the night and early morning hours, which could have led to misty conditions and a higher likelihood of dew. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the period, indicating a period of settled weather without significant fronts or storms. Wind speeds were light and showed very little variation, suggesting a calm weather pattern with limited wind chill effect or dispersion of air pollutants. The wind direction was predominantly from the south-west, which is typical for the region and could have contributed to the transport of oceanic air inland, potentially affecting coastal temperatures and fog formation.
