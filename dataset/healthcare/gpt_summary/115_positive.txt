Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a notable trend in the testing and positivity rates of influenza specimens. Initially, there was a steady increase in the number of specimens tested, reaching a peak at week 6, followed by a decline, which suggests that the influenza season may have reached its peak and is now receding. Despite the overall decrease in testing, the ratio of positive specimens peaked at week 7 at 27.37% and has since decreased to 6.26% by week 20, indicating a significant decline in influenza activity. However, the ratio of positive specimens for Influenza B was consistently lower than Influenza A, but it demonstrated a higher rate of increase, peaking at 10.95% in week 9 before following the overall declining trend. This pattern suggests that Influenza B became relatively more prevalent than Influenza A towards the middle of the observed period, which could have implications for healthcare providers in terms of diagnosis and treatment strategies, as well as for public health monitoring and vaccine formulation for the following season.
