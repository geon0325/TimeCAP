Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a fluctuation in the number of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with a notable increase in the positivity ratio for both Influenza A and B around weeks 13 and 14, hitting peaks of 0.08% and 0.09% respectively. Despite this mid-period spike, the overall trend shows a decrease in the ratio of positive specimens, culminating in week 20 with the lowest recorded ratios of 0.02% for Influenza A and 0.04% for Influenza B. The average positivity ratio of 6.26% over the 20-week period is not directly reflected in weekly data, suggesting considerable week-to-week variation. Such variability may impact healthcare resource allocation, requiring flexible response strategies to manage fluctuating demands for testing, treatment, and prevention measures. The declining trend in the latter weeks could indicate a waning flu season, but continued surveillance is necessary to confirm this trend and anticipate future healthcare needs.
