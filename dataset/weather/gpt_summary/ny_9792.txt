Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual rise in temperature, transitioning from below to above average for the season. Humidity levels have seen a significant decrease, indicating drier atmospheric conditions as the day progressed. The air pressure showed a sudden and unusual drop during the day, which could have been associated with a transient weather event, followed by a stabilization towards the evening. Wind speeds varied moderately with occasional gusts, and the prevailing wind direction was predominantly westerly, with slight variations to the southwest and northwest. These conditions suggest that the city may have transitioned from cooler and more stable weather to a drier, warmer pattern, potentially influenced by a passing weather system.
