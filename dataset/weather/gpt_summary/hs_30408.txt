Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature, with a significant increase observed during the daytime, indicating a typical diurnal pattern. Humidity levels showed an inverse relationship to temperature, starting high in the early morning hours and decreasing as temperatures rose, which is characteristic of the local climate dynamics. Air pressure experienced a gradual decreasing trend throughout the day, which could suggest the approach of a low-pressure system, potentially leading to changing weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate but increased markedly in the afternoon, suggesting an intensification of the local wind system, possibly due to thermal gradients. The wind direction was predominantly from the southern quadrant, shifting slightly throughout the day, which could be attributed to the passage of weather fronts or localized pressure changes.
