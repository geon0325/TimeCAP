Over the last 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has shown slight fluctuations with a general trend of cooling, before stabilizing and rising slightly towards the end of the period. Humidity levels remained very high throughout, often reaching saturation, which could indicate the presence of fog or mist, especially during the cooler nighttime hours. Air pressure has been steadily increasing, suggesting a strengthening high-pressure system that could lead to stable and dry weather conditions in the short term. Wind speeds remained mostly gentle to moderate, with some increase observed, but without significant gusts that would impact conditions severely. Wind direction has been predominantly from the east to northeast, which is typical for this region and could contribute to the transportation of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, maintaining the high humidity levels experienced.
