Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual increase in temperature with a notable rise during the latter half of the period, indicating a warming trend. Relative humidity levels fluctuated significantly, peaking at times, which may have contributed to a sensation of increased chilliness despite the rising temperatures. Air pressure remained relatively stable for the most part but displayed a sharp increase at one point, which could be associated with transient weather phenomena potentially affecting local conditions. Wind speeds were generally light with occasional calm periods, and the wind direction varied widely, suggesting an unsettled local atmospheric circulation pattern. The combination of rising temperatures, fluctuating humidity, stable air pressure with a brief spike, and variable winds are indicative of changing weather patterns that residents and visitors should be mindful of.
