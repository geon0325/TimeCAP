Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a notable warming trend with a peak in temperature during the latter part of the period, followed by a slight decrease towards the end. Humidity levels have shown significant fluctuations, with particularly high levels occurring concurrently with lower temperatures and vice versa, indicating possible early morning fog that cleared as the day warmed. Air pressure remained relatively stable initially but experienced a sharp decrease before returning to earlier levels, which could suggest the transient influence of a weather front. Wind speeds were generally moderate to high at the start of the period but decreased significantly, with a period of calm winds, before picking up speed again towards the end of the 24-hour window. The wind direction was predominantly from the west and northwest, with some variable shifts that included a brief period of easterly and southerly winds.
