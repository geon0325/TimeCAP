Over the past 20 weeks, the data indicates a decreasing trend in the number of deaths from influenza and pneumonia, which is also reflected in a general decline in their combined ratio to total mortality. Despite this overall decline, the ratio of mortality from these causes to total deaths has been fluctuating above the 20-week average of 7.84% for the majority of the period, only dropping below this threshold in the last six weeks. The highest recorded weekly mortality ratio of 9.67% significantly exceeds the average, suggesting a potential spike in cases or severity during that time. In recent weeks, there has been a slight uptick in the number of deaths from influenza from an all-time low, indicating the need for continued monitoring. The persistent higher-than-average mortality ratio for most of the 20-week period suggests that influenza and pneumonia remain significant health concerns, with implications for healthcare resource allocation and public health strategies.
