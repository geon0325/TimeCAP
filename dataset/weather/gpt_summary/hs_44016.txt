Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, moving from higher to more moderate values, indicative of a typical diurnal cooling pattern. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with particularly high values during the cooler early morning hours, suggesting the possibility of morning fog or dew. Atmospheric pressure showed a steady increase throughout the period, which typically signals stabilizing weather conditions and suggests a lower likelihood of precipitation in the near term. Wind speeds varied, with a period of calmer conditions around midday followed by an increase later on, potentially affecting outdoor activities and aviation. A notable shift in wind direction occurred early in the timeframe, transitioning from northerly to southerly winds and back to northerly, which could have implications for temperature and humidity trends due to the change in air masses affecting the region.
