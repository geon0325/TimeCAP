The data indicates a sustained elevated level of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases across all age groups over the last 20 weeks, consistently exceeding the 2.9% severity benchmark. The highest proportions of ILI were observed in the early weeks, with a peak ILI patient ratio of 7.37% in week 5, primarily driven by significant increases in the 5-24 and 25-49 age brackets. Although ILI ratios have declined over the period, they remain above the threshold, suggesting a persistent strain on healthcare resources. The recent downward trend, with the ILI ratio dropping below the benchmark to 2.4% in the latest week, may indicate a gradual easing of the influenza situation. However, the healthcare system should remain vigilant and prepared for fluctuations, as ILI ratios have not consistently stayed below the threshold, which could indicate potential for resurgence.
