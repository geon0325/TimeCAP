Over the past 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a general upward trend, increasing from 4061.22 to 4221.02, suggesting a positive sentiment among investors. In contrast, the VIX, which measures market volatility, has decreased from 20.09 to 15.65, indicating a reduction in investor anxiety and a more stable market outlook. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 have also displayed an upward trajectory, which may reflect strengthening confidence in global markets. Commodity prices have been more mixed, with Gold Futures fluctuating but ending on a slightly lower note at 1978.00 compared to the starting price of 2048.00, while Crude Oil Futures show volatility with a dip in the middle of the period before partially recovering to 70.10. Currency exchange rates have seen the USD appreciating against the EUR and JPY but depreciating against the CNY, which could suggest diverging economic conditions or policy shifts among these regions.
