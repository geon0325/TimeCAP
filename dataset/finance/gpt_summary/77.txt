Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown slight volatility with a downward trend, decreasing by 2.15% from 2927.25 to 2864.36, which may indicate a cautious outlook among investors. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, has seen an uptick, with peaks aligning with dips in the S&P 500, suggesting increased investor uncertainty during this period. Both the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have experienced declines, by 4.18% and 1.91% respectively, which could be reflective of broader global market concerns. Gold futures have risen by 0.39%, from 1275.50 to 1272.00, typically indicating a flight to safety in times of market stress, while Crude Oil Futures have fluctuated but ended slightly lower, suggesting a cautious stance on global economic growth. Exchange rates have remained relatively stable, with minor fluctuations in EUR/USD, USD/JPY, and USD/CNY, implying that currency markets have not reacted strongly to these equity and commodity price movements.
