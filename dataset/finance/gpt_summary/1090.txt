Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 showed a general uptrend, closing higher at 4205.52 from an initial 4119.58, despite some fluctuations, which may indicate a cautiously optimistic market sentiment. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, decreased overall from 17.78 to 17.46, aligning with the slight increase in the S&P 500, suggesting a stabilizing market. International markets also reflected growth, with Japan's Nikkei 225 rising significantly from 29157.95 to 31328.16, and the UK's FTSE 100 experiencing some volatility but ultimately declining to 7522.10 from 7773.00. Gold Futures saw a slight decrease from 2014.30 to 1958.00, indicating a potential shift in investor preference towards riskier assets, while Crude Oil Futures dipped to 69.46 from 71.66, which could signal concerns over global demand or a response to broader economic factors. Currency markets observed a weakening of the Euro and the Japanese Yen against the US Dollar, with EUR/USD moving from 1.10 to 1.07 and USD/JPY rising from 137.52 to 140.44, potentially reflecting a stronger US Dollar in the foreign exchange market.
