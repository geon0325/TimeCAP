Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperature has seen modest fluctuations with a notable dip and subsequent rise, indicating a possible passage of a weather front or localized atmospheric changes. Humidity has remained high throughout, with near saturation levels at certain hours, suggesting a likelihood of fog or mist, especially during the cooler early morning and late evening periods. Air pressure has been relatively stable, showing a slight decrease towards the end of the 24-hour period, which could be indicative of an approaching weather system that may alter current conditions. Wind speeds have generally been light to moderate, with a slight increase in the last few hours, and wind direction has been variable though predominantly from the south to southwest, which is typical for coastal San Francisco weather patterns. Overall, these conditions are suggestive of a stable weather pattern with the potential for some fog and a slight chance of changing conditions due to the small decrease in air pressure.
