Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, reaching its peak during the latter part of the day before slightly cooling off. Humidity levels showed a significant variation, with very high humidity recorded at times, which could have led to a feeling of mugginess. Air pressure remained relatively stable, though there was a noticeable increase towards the end of the period, which might suggest a building high-pressure system that could lead to clearer skies. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with an uptick observed in the last few hours, indicating a possible change in weather conditions. The predominant wind direction was from the south, shifting slightly to the south-southwest by the end of the day, which is typical for Houston and can bring in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico.
