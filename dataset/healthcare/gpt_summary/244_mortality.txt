Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the mortality ratio from influenza or pneumonia relative to total deaths, initially starting at 16.66%, dipping to 8.10% by week 4, and then rising steadily to peak at 18.51% by week 17. The total number of deaths has also fluctuated, with a marked decrease in week 4, followed by a general upward trend, reaching a high in week 17 before a slight decrease. The absolute number of deaths from pneumonia has shown an upward trend, with occasional dips, culminating in a significant rise from week 4 onwards, while deaths from influenza saw a drastic increase in week 18, which is an anomaly compared to the otherwise relatively stable low figures.

This indicates a growing impact of pneumonia on mortality, which could be stressing healthcare resources, especially in the later weeks where both the number of deaths from pneumonia and the ratio of mortality from influenza or pneumonia have increased. The sudden spike in influenza deaths in week 18 warrants further investigation to understand its causes and to prepare for potential future surges, emphasizing the need for continued surveillance and possibly increased healthcare preparedness for respiratory illnesses.
