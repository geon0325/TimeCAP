Over the past 20 weeks, the data reveals a significant increase in the proportion of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases among all patient visits, consistently surpassing the 2.9% severity benchmark from week 3 onwards. The peak of ILI activity occurred between weeks 10 and 11, with ratios of 6.31% and 6.90% respectively, indicating a potential strain on healthcare resources due to a high number of patients seeking medical attention. The age group 5-24 has been the most affected, showing the highest number of ILI cases, which suggests that schools and universities might be key environments for the spread of influenza. While the overall ILI ratio has shown a slight decrease in the last few weeks, it remains above the severity threshold, indicating continued public health vigilance is necessary. The consistent over-threshold ILI rates imply a sustained burden on the healthcare system, necessitating ongoing monitoring, prevention, and treatment measures to manage the impact.
