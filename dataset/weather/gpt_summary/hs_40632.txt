Over the last 24 hours, Houston has experienced a relatively stable temperature pattern, with minor fluctuations indicating typical diurnal variation, but overall remaining fairly consistent, suggesting a stable air mass over the region. Humidity levels have shown more variability, with peaks that could have contributed to a feeling of mugginess, particularly when humidity reached saturation. Air pressure has been on a slow declining trend, which may indicate the approach of a weather system that could bring changes in the near future. Wind speeds have been moderate with some brief increases, enough to provide mixing of the air but not so strong as to cause significant wind-related issues. The wind direction has varied significantly, suggesting the influence of passing weather fronts or localized weather systems impacting the area.
