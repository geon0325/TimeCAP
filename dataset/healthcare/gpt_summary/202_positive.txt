Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a marked increase in the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the overall positivity rate growing from 2.36% to 23.49%. This surge is primarily driven by Influenza B, which saw its positivity rate increase from 1.30% to 14.83%, while Influenza A also showed a significant rise from 1.06% to 8.66%. The highest weekly positivity rate for both Influenza A and B was observed in the penultimate week, at 9.34% and 17.59% respectively, before a slight decrease in the last week. The volume of specimens tested peaked in the 19th week at 64,024, coinciding with the highest overall positivity rate (26.93%), suggesting a potential peak in influenza activity. The escalating trend in positive cases suggests a burden on the healthcare system which may require increased resources for patient care, diagnostic testing, and preventive measures such as vaccination campaigns.
