Over the last 20 weeks, the proportion of deaths attributable to influenza or pneumonia has exhibited a general downward trend relative to the total number of deaths, starting at 7.41% and ending at 5.38%, with a few minor upticks. This overall decline is below the average mortality ratio of 7.84%, suggesting a better control or reduction in these respiratory-related deaths. The total number of deaths fluctuated slightly but remained within a narrow range, with the highest at 55,159 in week 1 and the lowest at 49,362 in week 17. Deaths from influenza showed a significant decrease from 266 in the first week to 11 in the last week, indicating a substantial reduction in influenza-related mortality. In contrast, deaths from pneumonia remained relatively more consistent, though they displayed a gradual decline from 3,821 to 2,689, which may suggest a persistent challenge for healthcare providers in managing pneumonia cases.
