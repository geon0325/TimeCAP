Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, reaching its lowest point during the early morning hours before rising again towards the afternoon and evening, indicative of a typical diurnal temperature variation. Humidity levels have fluctuated significantly, with notably higher humidity occurring in the early hours, which could have led to a feeling of increased chill before dropping as the temperatures rose, suggesting a possible discomfort due to dryness towards the latter part of the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with only minor fluctuations, staying within a range that is generally associated with settled weather conditions. Wind speeds were mostly light and showed little variation, which would not have contributed significantly to changes in the perceived temperature or dispersion of pollutants. The wind direction was predominantly from the northwest, shifting more westerly and then southwesterly towards the end of the period, which may have influenced the temperature rise and a shift in humidity levels.
