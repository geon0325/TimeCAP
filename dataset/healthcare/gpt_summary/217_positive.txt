Over the past 20 weeks, there has been a significant fluctuation in the number of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the peak ratio of positive specimens reaching 30.26% in week 10, followed by a steady decline to 0.62% by week 20. Influenza A showed a more pronounced peak earlier in the time series, constituting a higher proportion of positive cases during weeks 7 through 10, but then dramatically decreased to less than 1% by week 20. In contrast, Influenza B maintained a more consistent presence, though it also declined towards the end of the period, suggesting a tapering off of the influenza season. The overall trend indicates a seasonal outbreak that peaked around mid-series and has since been waning, potentially signaling a transition out of the high-risk period for influenza transmission. This downward trend is critical for healthcare resource planning, as it suggests a reduced burden on testing facilities and a possible shift in focus towards other healthcare priorities in the coming weeks.
