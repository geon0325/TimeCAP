Over the last 20 weeks, the volume of respiratory specimens tested for influenza has increased significantly from 6,330 to 40,917, with the peak number of tests conducted in week 19 at 42,526. Despite fluctuations, there is a notable upward trend in the ratio of positive specimens, starting at 0.17% and ending at 0.29%, peaking at 0.40% in week 7. Influenza B has shown a more pronounced increase in positive cases compared to Influenza A, with its ratio rising from 0.06% to 0.20%, suggesting a more significant spread or seasonal pattern for Influenza B. The ratio of positive specimens for Influenza A remained relatively stable, fluctuating modestly around the overall average of 0.11%, indicating a steady presence of Influenza A cases. These trends highlight the importance of continued surveillance and resource allocation for influenza testing and vaccination, especially for Influenza B, as its increasing positivity rate could signify a growing impact on public health.
