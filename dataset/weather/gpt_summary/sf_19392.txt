Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced relatively stable temperatures with a modest increasing trend, suggesting a slight warming pattern. Humidity levels have remained at saturation for the entire duration, indicating a persistent heavy moisture content in the air which could result in foggy conditions or precipitation. Air pressure has been consistently high with only minor fluctuations, which is typically associated with stable weather conditions, but the high humidity could still lead to cloud formation and possible drizzle or light rain. Wind speeds have generally been light to moderate, increasing slightly through the period, which could aid in dispersing fog and reducing the likelihood of prolonged overcast conditions. The wind direction has gradually shifted from easterly to southerly, which might bring in cooler maritime air and potentially impact temperatures and cloud cover.
