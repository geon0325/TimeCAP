Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures experienced a significant diurnal variation, with the highest values during the afternoon hours and a notable decrease during the night, indicative of clear skies and low humidity conditions that prevailed for most of the day. Humidity levels were generally low but saw a dramatic increase overnight, which could have led to cooler conditions and potential morning fog typical for the region, before decreasing again. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with only slight fluctuations that are unlikely to have had a significant impact on weather patterns. Wind speeds were consistently light, suggesting a calm weather period, with wind directions showing variability but no dominant pattern. This combination of light winds, clear skies, and variable humidity levels would have contributed to comfortable daytime conditions followed by cooler nights.
