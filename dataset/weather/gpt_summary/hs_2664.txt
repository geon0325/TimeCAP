Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable upward trend in temperature, transitioning from cooler conditions in the early hours to warmer conditions in the afternoon, followed by a slight decrease towards the evening. Humidity levels were at their highest during the night and early morning hours, which, combined with lower temperatures, could have led to mist or fog formation, but these levels decreased significantly as the temperature rose throughout the day. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with only minor fluctuations, indicating a period of steady weather without significant frontal activity. Wind speeds were generally light to calm, with occasional light breezes, suggesting limited wind-related impacts on local conditions. The variability in wind direction suggests the presence of varying local breezes, rather than a dominant weather front influencing the area.
