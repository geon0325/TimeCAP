The analysis of the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data over the past 20 weeks indicates a gradual decline in the overall number of patients presenting with ILI symptoms, followed by a recent uptick. The highest proportion of ILI cases is consistently found in the youngest age group (0-4 years), which may suggest a heightened susceptibility or increased exposure in this demographic. Notably, the ratio of ILI patients has remained well below the baseline threshold of 2.9%, suggesting that ILI is not prevalent enough to be considered widespread at this time. Despite the overall low ILI activity, the recent increase in the ratio of ILI patients and the rising number of ILI cases particularly in the youngest and the most economically active age groups (5-24 and 25-49) could signal the beginning of an upward trend that warrants close monitoring. The healthcare system should remain vigilant and prepared for a potential increase in demand for medical services if the trend continues, especially in pediatric care and general practice settings.
