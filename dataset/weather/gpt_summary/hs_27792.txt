Over the last 24 hours, Houston experienced a gradual increase in temperature from the early morning hours, reaching a peak during the late afternoon before stabilizing. Humidity levels showed significant variation, with a peak that coincided with the lowest temperatures in the early morning hours, suggesting the presence of early mist or fog that likely cleared as the day progressed. Air pressure remained relatively high and stable throughout the period, with only minor fluctuations, indicative of settled weather conditions. Wind speeds were generally light to moderate and predominantly came from northerly directions in the early hours, shifting to easterly and then showing a marked shift to come from the west later in the period. These stable conditions, with light winds and high pressure, are typically associated with fair weather, but the high humidity levels in the early hours could have led to some morning travel disruptions due to reduced visibility.
