Over the last 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a noticeable drop in temperature followed by a gradual rise, indicating a typical diurnal pattern with cooler conditions overnight and warming during the day. Humidity levels experienced a significant fluctuation, with a peak during the cooler early morning hours, which is common as cooler air holds less moisture, leading to higher relative humidity. Air pressure remained relatively stable, with a slight increase midday, suggesting stable weather conditions without the immediate approach of a significant weather system. Wind speeds were generally light to calm throughout the period, with little to no wind at times, which could lead to a buildup of pollutants in the air due to lack of dispersion. The wind direction showed variability, although there was no dominant wind pattern, suggesting a lack of strong weather fronts influencing the area.
