Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a modest decline in temperature, transitioning from warmer conditions to a cooler environment overnight. Humidity levels were variable, peaking at full saturation during the early hours and then gradually decreasing, indicating a possible clearance of moisture in the atmosphere later in the day. Air pressure showed a steady increase throughout the period, suggesting a trend toward more stable weather conditions. Wind speeds were relatively calm at the beginning and end of the period but picked up significantly during the day, with the wind direction shifting from predominantly southerly to northerly, reflecting a change in the weather pattern. The combination of rising air pressure, decreasing humidity, and the northerly wind shift may lead to clearer and more stable weather in the near future for Houston.
