Over the last 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature, starting off relatively high, dipping during the cooler early morning hours, and then rising significantly towards the latter part of the period. Humidity levels experienced a peak coinciding with the lowest temperatures, suggesting possible early morning fog or dew, before decreasing as temperatures rose again. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with a slight increase during the middle of the time period, which could indicate a brief period of more settled weather. Wind speeds were mostly light and variable, with no significant gusts that would impact conditions greatly. The wind direction was generally from the south to southeast, which is typical for Houston and could contribute to the influx of warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico, affecting both temperature and humidity.
