Over the past 24 hours in Houston, temperatures exhibited a typical diurnal pattern, with a peak during the afternoon and a gradual decline overnight, followed by a rise towards the following afternoon. Relative humidity levels fluctuated significantly, reaching saturation during the early morning hours, which suggests the presence of fog or dew, but decreased sharply during the afternoon, indicating drier conditions. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting a period of steady weather without the immediate approach of significant weather systems. Wind speeds varied from light to moderate, with occasional increases that could enhance the wind chill effect during cooler parts of the day. The wind direction was predominantly from the south-southeast, which is common for Houston, but also included a brief shift to northerly winds, which could influence the humidity and temperature levels in the area.
