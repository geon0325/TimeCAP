The Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data over the last 20 weeks indicates a decreasing trend in the ratio of ILI patients, with the latest values significantly below the baseline threshold for determining an influenza outbreak. The highest rates of ILI were observed at the beginning of the time series, with a gradual decline across all age groups as the weeks progressed. The most substantial decreases were seen in the younger age groups, particularly those aged 0-4 and 5-24, which could suggest that interventions targeting these age groups have been effective or that the spread of illness within these more socially active populations has subsided. The consistent decline across all age groups suggests a current easing of the healthcare burden related to ILI. However, continuous monitoring is necessary to preempt any potential resurgence, especially considering the impact ILI can have on vulnerable populations such as the elderly and those with comorbid conditions.
