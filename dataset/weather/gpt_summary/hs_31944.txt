Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual rise in temperature, reaching its peak in the late afternoon before starting to decrease slightly into the evening. Humidity levels were variable but showed a significant drop during mid-day, which is atypical given the overall high humidity profile characteristic of the region. Atmospheric pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, indicating no immediate signs of severe weather systems moving through the area. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with a notable increase during the afternoon, which coincides with the decrease in humidity and the peak in temperature. The wind direction was predominantly from the south, shifting to a northerly direction around mid-day before settling back into a southerly pattern, suggesting a possible passage of a frontal boundary.
