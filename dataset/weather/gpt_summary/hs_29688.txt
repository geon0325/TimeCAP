Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperatures, with a general trend of cooling during the night hours and warming during the day. The city saw high humidity levels throughout the period, reaching a saturation point in the early morning, which could have increased the likelihood of fog or mist, potentially impacting visibility. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a minor increase, indicating stable weather conditions without significant fronts or storms. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate and showed a decrease during the night, suggesting calm conditions that likely contributed to the increased humidity and potential for dew or frost formation. The predominant wind direction was from the south to the southeast, which is typical for Houston and suggests a flow of warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico, potentially contributing to the high humidity levels observed.
