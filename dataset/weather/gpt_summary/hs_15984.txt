Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature experienced a noticeable fluctuation, with a general increase during the day and a subsequent decrease towards the early morning hours. Humidity levels showed a reverse trend compared to temperature, starting high in the early hours, decreasing significantly as temperatures peaked, and then increasing again as the night approached. Air pressure saw a gradual decrease throughout the day, which is indicative of changing weather patterns that could potentially lead to instability in the weather conditions. Wind speed remained relatively light but picked up significantly in the latter part of the period, which could influence the dispersal of any atmospheric particulates and could be a precursor to changing weather systems. The wind direction varied widely, suggesting a lack of a dominant weather front and the potential for variable weather conditions.
