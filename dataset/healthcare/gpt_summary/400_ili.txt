Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant rise in Influenza-like Illness (ILI) across all age groups, with the incidence of ILI cases exceeding the 2.9% severity benchmark for eight consecutive weeks, peaking at 7.37% in the 12th week. The most substantial increases occurred in the younger populations, particularly those aged 0-4 and 5-24, which saw the highest number of ILI cases, suggesting a higher transmission rate or vulnerability within these age groups. After reaching the peak, there has been a gradual decline in ILI percentages, yet the rates remain above the benchmark in all subsequent weeks except for the last reported week, where it slightly dipped to 2.71%. The elevated levels of ILI for a sustained period have likely placed considerable pressure on healthcare resources, indicating a need for ongoing vigilance and possibly increased healthcare support, especially for pediatric and young adult populations. The data suggests that while the immediate crisis may be subsiding, the healthcare system should remain prepared for potential fluctuations in ILI cases and continue efforts to mitigate the spread of influenza, particularly among the most affected age groups.
