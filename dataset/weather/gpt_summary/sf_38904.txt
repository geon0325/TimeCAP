Over the last 24 hours in San Francisco, there has been a noticeable decrease in temperature, reaching a low in the early hours before gradually increasing again during the day. Humidity levels have fluctuated, with peaks coinciding with the lower temperatures, suggesting possible early morning fogginess or dew. Air pressure experienced a significant rise during the middle of the period, which could be indicative of a transient high-pressure system moving through the area, often associated with clearer skies. Wind speeds varied moderately, with some stronger gusts occurring later on, possibly leading to brisk conditions, especially in open areas. The wind direction shifted from a northerly direction to westerly and then predominantly northwesterly, which is typical for coastal cities like San Francisco and can influence the distribution of temperatures across the region.
