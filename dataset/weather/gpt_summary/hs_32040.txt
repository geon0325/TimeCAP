Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature that peaked during the afternoon and dropped towards the early morning hours, indicative of the typical diurnal cycle. Relative humidity levels have been inversely related to temperature changes, with higher humidity present during cooler periods and significant drops observed when temperatures were at their highest. Atmospheric pressure has remained relatively stable with a slight increasing trend towards the middle of the period, suggesting steady weather conditions without the immediate approach of significant weather fronts. Wind speeds varied, with calmer conditions during the nighttime and early morning, followed by an increase in windiness in the late afternoon and evening. The wind direction has shifted throughout the day, primarily coming from the south and southeast, which could have contributed to warmer temperatures and the transportation of moisture into the area, affecting humidity levels.
