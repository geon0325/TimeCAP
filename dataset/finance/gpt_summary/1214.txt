Over the past 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown an upward trend, increasing from 4117.37 to 4559.34, which indicates a bullish sentiment in the market. The VIX, commonly known as the "fear index," has correspondingly decreased from 21.27 to 12.46, suggesting that investor anxiety has diminished, potentially signaling increased investor confidence. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 both exhibited growth, with the Nikkei 225 rising from 30991.69 to 33625.53 and the FTSE 100 from 7291.30 to 7488.20, pointing towards positive momentum in both Asian and European markets. Gold Futures have experienced volatility but ended on a slight uptrend, moving from 1988.60 to 2002.20, which could reflect investors' hedging against inflation or market uncertainty. Crude Oil Futures have declined from 85.54 to 75.54, potentially due to concerns over global demand or increasing supply, while currency exchange rates have seen the Euro and the Japanese Yen appreciating against the US Dollar, with the EUR/USD pair rising from 1.06 to 1.09, and the USD/JPY pair decreasing from 150.37 to 149.63, but the Yuan remained relatively stable against the Dollar with minor fluctuations around the 7.30 level, closing at 7.09.
