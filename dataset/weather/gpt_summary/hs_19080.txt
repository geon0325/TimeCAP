Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced relatively stable temperatures with a slight fluctuation indicating a consistent weather pattern. Humidity levels were high throughout the period, often reaching saturation, which suggests the presence of considerable moisture in the air that could lead to foggy conditions or precipitation if temperatures were to drop. Air pressure remained high and increased slightly, typically indicative of stable weather conditions and possibly clearer skies. Wind speeds were generally low, suggesting a calm atmosphere with limited wind chill effect, although there was some variability in wind direction, which may point to changing weather patterns on a local scale. The changes in wind direction, from predominantly southern to a more variable pattern, could imply the arrival of a weather system that might alter the current conditions.
