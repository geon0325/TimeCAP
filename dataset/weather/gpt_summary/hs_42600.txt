Over the last 24 hours, Houston experienced gradually increasing temperatures, reaching a peak in the late afternoon before cooling slightly into the evening. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, with lower humidity during the peak afternoon temperatures and a notable increase during the cooler nighttime and early morning hours, indicating potential discomfort due to mugginess. Air pressure showed a slight decreasing trend through the period, which could suggest the approach of a weather system that may affect the region shortly. Wind speeds remained relatively light and variable, which would not have provided much relief from the heat. The wind direction varied mostly from southerly to southwesterly, which is typical for Houston and may have contributed to the warmer temperatures due to the warm air advection from those directions.
