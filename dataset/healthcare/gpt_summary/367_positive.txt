Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a notable fluctuation in the rate of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with the percentage peaking at 26.27% in week 7 and subsequently declining to 0.92% by week 20. The data indicates that Influenza A is the predominant strain, reaching its highest positivity rate of 26.15% in week 7, whereas Influenza B remained relatively low, peaking at just 0.27% in the final two weeks. The overall trend suggests a significant surge in influenza activity in the early weeks, with a marked decrease towards the end of the 20-week period. This pattern of activity could have implications for healthcare resource allocation, indicating a need for increased vigilance and preparedness during peak influenza periods. Moreover, the decline in positive specimens suggests a current easing of the burden on healthcare systems, but continuous monitoring is essential to respond to potential future surges.
