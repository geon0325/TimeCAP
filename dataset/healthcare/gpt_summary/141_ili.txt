Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a significant upward trend in the ratio of ILI patients, surpassing the baseline threshold for determining an influenza situation. Notably, the highest increases have been observed in the age groups 5-24 and 25-49, indicating that these demographics could be experiencing a more robust spread of ILI. The data also shows that the oldest age group (65 or more) has a lower incidence of ILI compared to other adult age groups, suggesting that the impact on older adults has been less pronounced during this period. The consistent rise in ILI ratios week over week raises concerns about the potential strain on healthcare resources, including increased demand for medical care and possible shortages of healthcare workers. Given these trends, public health interventions targeted towards the most affected age groups and measures to bolster healthcare capacity may be necessary to mitigate the growing impact of ILI on the healthcare system.
