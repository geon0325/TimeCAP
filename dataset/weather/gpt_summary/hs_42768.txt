Humidity levels varied significantly, with peaks correlating with the cooler temperatures in the early hours and late evening, possibly indicating the presence of morning and evening dew or fog. Air pressure showed a gradual decreasing trend throughout the period, suggesting the potential development of a low-pressure system that could lead to changing weather patterns such as increased cloudiness or precipitation.
