The analysis of the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data over the last 20 weeks indicates a decreasing trend in the overall number of patients presenting with ILI symptoms across all age groups, with the most significant reduction observed in the youngest age category (0-4 years). Despite this downward trend, there has been a slight uptick in the ratio of ILI patients in recent weeks, suggesting a potential resurgence of ILI cases. The ratios have consistently remained below the baseline of 2.9%, indicating that the ILI activity is lower than the threshold typically associated with influenza outbreaks. However, the recent increase in ILI percentages, along with the rise in cases among all age groups, warrants close monitoring to detect any early signs of a potential outbreak. Healthcare systems should remain vigilant and be prepared to allocate resources effectively should the trend reverse and ILI activity intensify.
