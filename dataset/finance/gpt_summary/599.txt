The VIX, a measure of market volatility, generally decreased from 22.18 to 18.15, indicating a reduction in market uncertainty and investor fear. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 both exhibited upward momentum, with the Nikkei 225 rising from 28044.45 to 29291.01 and the FTSE 100 climbing from 6950.20 to 7185.00, which suggests investor confidence in these markets. Gold Futures experienced a modest decline, suggesting a potential shift in investor preference away from safe-haven assets, while Crude Oil Futures saw a significant rise from 63.36 to 72.15, which could indicate expectations of strengthening demand. Exchange rates remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, as EUR/USD and USD/CNY moved within a narrow band, and USD/JPY showed a slight appreciation, which might reflect market sentiment towards currency stability in the short term.
