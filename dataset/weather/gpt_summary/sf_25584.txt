Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco experienced a gradual decrease in temperature which was followed by a noticeable increase during the afternoon hours, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, reaching high levels that suggest the presence of moisture in the air, which could have led to foggy conditions, particularly when the humidity peaked. Air pressure saw a sharp drop at one point, which is often associated with the onset of transient weather systems that can bring changes in weather patterns, including precipitation or wind shifts. Wind speeds varied throughout the day, with periods of higher gusts that could have contributed to cooler perceived temperatures and possibly influenced the dispersal of any fog or low-level clouds. A notable shift in wind direction occurred in the evening, moving from predominantly westerly to southerly directions, which may have implications for temperature and moisture transport in the region.
