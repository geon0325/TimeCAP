Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, which is typical as the day transitions into night, followed by a rise during the daylight hours. Humidity levels saw a general increase towards the night, reaching a plateau, which is indicative of a stable but moist air mass over the city; however, these levels dropped significantly as the temperature rose again. Air pressure remained relatively steady with only minor fluctuations, suggesting stable weather conditions without the immediate approach of significant weather systems. Wind speeds varied minimally, with periods of calm interspersed with light breezes, not indicating any strong wind events. Wind direction showed variability, with no dominant direction, which is characteristic of a region experiencing local circulation patterns rather than being influenced by larger-scale weather systems.
