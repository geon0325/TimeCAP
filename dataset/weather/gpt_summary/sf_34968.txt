Over the past day in San Francisco, there was a noticeable drop in temperature following a peak, indicating a trend of cooling, which is common as night approaches. Humidity levels saw a significant rise, with values remaining high for the majority of the period, suggesting a moist air mass over the area which could lead to foggy conditions, especially during the cooler nighttime and early morning hours. The air pressure remained fairly stable, with only minor fluctuations, suggesting a period of steady weather without the immediate influence of strong weather fronts or systems. Wind speeds were generally light and variable, which is typical for coastal regions and unlikely to have a significant impact on the weather. Lastly, the wind direction varied but predominantly came from the southerly quadrant, which in San Francisco, can often bring cooler ocean air inland, moderating temperatures.
