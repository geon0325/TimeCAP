Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature has shown a slight cooling trend during the night before gradually warming up through the day, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels have been high, peaking at times to saturation, which could have resulted in foggy conditions, especially when combined with the cooler night temperatures. Air pressure remained relatively stable with a slight decrease during the day, followed by a significant increase, suggesting a potential change in weather patterns or the passage of a frontal system. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate but showed occasional gusts that may have influenced the dispersion of humidity and other atmospheric elements. The wind direction has been variable, with a general preference for southerly to south-easterly directions, which is common for the region and can often contribute to moisture transport from the Gulf of Mexico.
