Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, reaching its lowest point during the early morning hours before steadily climbing back up as the day progressed. Humidity levels varied with a general pattern of increase during the cooler early hours, followed by a significant drop during midday, which could indicate the presence of a dry air mass moving into the area. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day with only slight fluctuations, suggesting steady atmospheric conditions without any immediate signs of developing storms or fronts. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with a noticeable increase towards the end of the period, which could result in cooler conditions moving forward. The wind direction showed variability, including a shift from predominantly westerly winds to a mix of southerly and northerly breezes, before returning to a westerly direction, which is common for coastal cities like San Francisco and can influence fog and marine layer development.
