Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced remarkably stable weather conditions with a consistent temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed, and wind direction. The steady temperature suggests no significant frontal activity or changes in air masses affecting the region. Low variability in humidity and pressure indicates a stable atmosphere without the presence of rapidly developing weather systems. The uniform wind speed and direction point to a persistent weather pattern, likely governed by a dominant high-pressure system in the area. These conditions are conducive to calm and predictable weather, which is expected to continue in the absence of any incoming weather disturbances.
