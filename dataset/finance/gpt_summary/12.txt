Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a general upward trend, closing higher at 2775.60 from an initial value of 2670.71, which may indicate a growing investor confidence in the US market. The VIX, or Volatility Index, has decreased to 14.91, suggesting a reduction in market volatility and a more stable market environment. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 have both exhibited fluctuations but ultimately displayed a slight increase which aligns with the positive movement seen in the S&P 500. Gold Futures have increased in value from $1281.30 to $1318.10, reflecting a possible shift towards safe-haven assets amidst ongoing global uncertainties. The currency exchange rates have remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, indicating a steady forex market; however, the slight weakening of the USD against JPY and CNY may have implications for international trade dynamics.
