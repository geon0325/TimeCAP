Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 showed volatility with a slight upward trend, closing higher at the end of the period, which may indicate a cautiously optimistic market sentiment. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, experienced a peak mid-period, suggesting a phase of heightened investor anxiety which later eased, aligning with the recovery in the S&P 500. The Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 also reflected uncertainty, with the Nikkei 225 recovering some earlier losses towards the end, and the FTSE 100 displaying a dip followed by a rebound to near starting levels, potentially indicating resilience in international markets. Gold Futures remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, hinting at investors maintaining a hedge against volatility, while Crude Oil Futures recovered from a sharp drop, suggesting a possible stabilization or response to changing supply dynamics. Exchange rates for EUR/USD and USD/CNY showed little change, indicating a stable currency market, while the USD/JPY experienced slight appreciation, possibly reflecting a modest shift towards the safety of the U.S. dollar amidst market fluctuations.
