Over the last 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures exhibited a typical diurnal pattern with a peak during the day followed by a gradual decrease through the night into the early morning hours. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, reaching high levels that coincide with lower temperatures, suggesting possible early morning fog or dew. Air pressure experienced some variance, indicating the passage of different air masses and possibly changing weather conditions. Wind speeds varied with several periods of increased activity, which could have contributed to the dispersal of fog or low clouds, potentially affecting local temperatures and humidity levels. The wind direction was predominantly from the south and west, with some variability, which is typical for coastal areas like San Francisco and may influence coastal fog patterns.
