Over the past 24 hours, the temperature in San Francisco experienced a mild fluctuation, starting off warmer before cooling down and then rising again towards the end of the period. The humidity levels have shown variations inversely related to temperature changes, with peaks during the cooler hours, which is typical due to the decrease in air's capacity to hold moisture as temperature drops. Air pressure remained relatively stable for most of the period but saw a noticeable drop towards the end, which could indicate an approaching weather system that may bring changes such as increased wind or precipitation. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with some periods of calmer conditions, and the predominant wind direction shifted between westerly and easterly vectors, suggesting variable air flow patterns over the city. The combination of dropping pressure and variable winds could signal an incoming front, potentially affecting the region's weather conditions shortly.
