Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, the temperature experienced a typical diurnal cycle, starting and ending slightly above average, with a notable increase during daylight hours before cooling off at night. Humidity levels remained high throughout the period, consistent with the city's coastal climate, which can lead to foggy conditions, especially during the early morning and late evening hours. Air pressure was relatively stable with a minor fluctuation that is not indicative of significant weather changes. Wind speeds were generally light and variable, with no significant gusts that would suggest stormy conditions. The wind direction showed some variability but stayed primarily within the western quadrant, which is characteristic of the prevailing ocean breezes affecting San Francisco.
