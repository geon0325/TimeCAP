Over the past 24 hours, San Francisco has experienced a slight fluctuation in temperatures, with a general cooling trend overnight that transitioned to warming during the daytime. Humidity levels showed periodic increases, particularly during the cooler early morning hours, indicative of a higher likelihood of morning fog that is typical for the area. Air pressure remained relatively stable throughout the day, with a marginal decreasing trend, which could suggest an approaching weather system or front. Wind speeds were mostly light with occasional moderate gusts; these conditions are conducive to a calm weather pattern but may also contribute to slower dispersion of any fog or low clouds. The wind direction varied significantly, with notable shifts throughout the day, which could influence coastal weather patterns and potentially bring changes in the marine layer's influence on local weather conditions.
