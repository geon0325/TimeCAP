The analysis of the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data over the last 20 weeks indicates a decreasing trend in the percentage of ILI patients across all age groups, with the ratio of ILI patients dipping below the baseline of 2.9% after the initial weeks and continuing to decline. The age group of 0-4 years consistently shows the highest number of ILI cases, suggesting that young children remain the most affected demographic. A significant reduction in the total number of patients visiting healthcare facilities has been observed, which may indicate a general decrease in ILI activity or potentially reduced healthcare-seeking behavior for such symptoms. The consistent decrease across all age groups in both ILI patient numbers and the percentage ratio suggests a current easing of the ILI burden on the healthcare system. Nonetheless, vigilance is necessary as even with lowering rates, ILI remains present and may have implications for resource allocation and readiness for potential future increases in ILI cases.
