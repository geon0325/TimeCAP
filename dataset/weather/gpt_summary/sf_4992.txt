Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures exhibited a typical diurnal pattern with the coolest temperatures occurring around dawn and the warmest in the late afternoon. Humidity levels fluctuated significantly, reaching their peak in the early morning hours, which is consistent with the typical increase in relative humidity following the evening cooling. Air pressure steadily declined throughout the period, suggesting a possible change in weather conditions such as an approaching weather system. Wind speeds were variable but mostly light to moderate, with occasional calm periods; the wind direction was predominantly from the north and east but also showed some variability with occasional westerly winds. The combination of falling air pressure and variable wind conditions could indicate the potential for changing weather, possibly leading to increased cloudiness or a chance of precipitation in the near future.
