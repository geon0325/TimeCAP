Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a noticeable fluctuation in temperature, with a general warming trend during the daytime followed by a slight cooling trend in the later hours. Humidity levels were variable but reached high levels, indicating the presence of considerable moisture in the air, which could contribute to the feeling of mugginess. Air pressure remained relatively stable with only minor variations, suggesting that no significant weather fronts are currently moving through the area. Wind speeds increased throughout the day, culminating in strong gusts, and the predominant wind direction shifted between southerly and easterly, which is typical for this region and can contribute to moisture movement from the Gulf of Mexico. The combination of high humidity and increased wind speeds could lead to greater chances of precipitation and potentially unsettled weather conditions in the near future.
