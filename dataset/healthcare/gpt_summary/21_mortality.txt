Over the last 20 weeks, the mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia to the total number of deaths has fluctuated around the historical average of 7.84%, with a noticeable dip below this threshold, averaging 5.81% for the period. The total deaths peaked in the most recent week at 52,143, while the number of deaths from pneumonia showed an increasing trend, ending with 3,194 in the last week, the highest count in the observed period. In contrast, deaths from influenza remained relatively low and stable, with a slight increase towards the end, suggesting that pneumonia was the primary contributor to the overall mortality from these conditions. The lowest mortality ratio from Influenza or Pneumonia was recorded in week 10 at 5.39%, while the highest was in the last week at 6.15%, indicating a recent upward trend that could signal a public health concern if it continues. This pattern suggests the need for ongoing vigilance and potentially increased healthcare resources to manage and mitigate the impact of pneumonia on mortality rates.
