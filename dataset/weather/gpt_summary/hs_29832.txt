Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a moderate temperature fluctuation, starting off warmer, cooling down significantly overnight, and warming up again towards the current hour. Humidity levels peaked during the cooler early hours, indicative of a possible morning fog, but have since decreased as temperatures rose, suggesting clearer conditions. Air pressure has been relatively stable but showed a slight decreasing trend over the day, which could imply a change in weather patterns, such as the potential for developing weather fronts or systems. Wind speeds were generally light, with some increase during the afternoon, which may have contributed to the dispersal of humidity and any morning fog. Wind direction varied, with a shift from predominantly westerly to southerly and then easterly directions, which could be associated with the passage of a weather system through the region.
