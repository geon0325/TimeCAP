Over the last 24 hours, New York City experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, reaching its lowest point in the early morning before slowly rising again throughout the day. Humidity levels showed a notable decrease from early morning to the afternoon, suggesting drier conditions as the day progressed. Air pressure was relatively stable initially and then showed a steady increase, indicative of a high-pressure system possibly leading to clearer skies and calmer weather. Wind speeds were mostly light to moderate, with a peak during midday, which could have contributed to a wind chill effect, making the temperatures feel cooler than they were. Wind direction varied, predominantly coming from the south-southwest to west-northwest, which is typical for the region's weather patterns and could influence the transportation of air masses and weather fronts into the area.
