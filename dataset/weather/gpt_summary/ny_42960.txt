Over the past 24 hours, New York City has experienced a gradual increase in temperature followed by a slight cooling trend towards the current hour, indicating a typical diurnal pattern. Humidity levels varied inversely with temperature, starting at moderate levels in the cooler morning hours, spiking during the cooler and more stable atmospheric conditions, and then dropping significantly as temperatures peaked during the day. Atmospheric pressure remained remarkably stable throughout the period, suggesting a sustained weather pattern without significant short-term changes. Wind speeds were generally light to gentle and showed some variability, with a noticeable increase during the time of peak temperature, which could have contributed to the dispersal of humidity. Wind direction was predominantly from the north to northeast, with occasional shifts to easterly and northerly directions, which is consistent with a high-pressure system influencing the area.
