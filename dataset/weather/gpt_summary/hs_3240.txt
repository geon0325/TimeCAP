Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual decrease in temperature, which later reversed into a modest warming trend, indicating a diurnal temperature variation consistent with typical daily patterns. Humidity levels have shown a significant decrease, suggesting a drying trend in the local atmosphere which could be associated with increased comfort levels or changes in atmospheric pressure systems. Speaking of which, air pressure experienced a slight rise followed by a gradual decrease, which could be indicative of a transient high-pressure system affecting the area, potentially leading to stable weather conditions temporarily. Wind speeds varied, with some hours experiencing gentle to moderate breezes, while a couple of peaks could imply the passage of weather fronts or localized pressure gradients. The wind direction was predominantly from the north to the northwest, with occasional shifts, which could influence local temperature and humidity levels depending on the origin of the air masses.
