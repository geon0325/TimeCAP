Over the past 24 hours in Houston, there has been a notable fluctuation in temperature, experiencing a significant increase during the day, followed by a decrease at night, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels showed an inverse relationship with temperature, where higher temperatures corresponded with lower humidity levels and vice versa, reaching peak humidity during the cooler early morning hours. Air pressure has remained relatively stable, with only slight variations, indicating a steady atmospheric condition without the immediate presence of strong weather fronts. Wind speeds have been mostly light to gentle, with a slight increase during the time of peak temperatures, which could contribute to the dispersal of humidity and the perception of a more comfortable climate. The wind direction has been variable, primarily coming from the southeast, which is typical for Houston and may suggest the continuation of current weather patterns without the influence of any major weather systems.
