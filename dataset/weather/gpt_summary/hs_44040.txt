Over the past 24 hours in Houston, the temperature experienced a gradual rise throughout the day, peaking in the late afternoon before commencing a slow decline, indicative of typical diurnal variation. Humidity levels showed a decreasing trend as the temperature increased, which is common as warmer air can hold more moisture before it reaches saturation. Air pressure remained relatively stable with only minor fluctuations, suggesting a lack of significant atmospheric disturbances during this period. Wind speed varied but generally stayed within a light to moderate range, with no indications of strong wind events. The predominant wind direction was from the northeast, with occasional variations, which could have influenced the local temperature and humidity levels as winds from this direction tend to be cooler and drier in this region.
