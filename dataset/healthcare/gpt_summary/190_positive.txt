Over the last 20 weeks, there has been a fluctuating trend in the number of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza, with an overall average positive ratio of 6.26%. The data indicate a peak in the ratio of positive specimens at week 14 (3.46%), which is primarily driven by a surge in Influenza B cases as evidenced by a ratio of positive specimens for Influenza B at 2.10%. Despite the number of specimens tested increasing over the period, the ratio of positive specimens has seen a decline in recent weeks, reaching its lowest at 1.31% and 1.48% in weeks 19 and 20, respectively. The ratio of positive specimens for Influenza A has also decreased to below average in the last two weeks, suggesting a possible downward trend in Influenza A activity. The observed trends are critical for healthcare resource planning, particularly in anticipating the need for influenza-related healthcare services and managing potential surges in patient volume.
