Over the past 24 hours, Houston has experienced a gradual increase in temperature, which is indicative of warming weather conditions throughout the day. Concurrently, humidity levels have varied significantly, reaching a point of complete saturation, suggesting the possibility of fog or precipitation events during periods of peak humidity. Air pressure has shown a steady decreasing trend, which could be associated with an approaching weather system that may lead to unstable weather conditions. Wind speeds have remained relatively light but have shown some variability, with a significant shift in wind direction noted, indicating a possible change in weather patterns. Overall, the combination of high humidity, decreasing pressure, and shifting wind directions may suggest the potential for inclement weather, including rain or thunderstorms, in the near future for Houston.
