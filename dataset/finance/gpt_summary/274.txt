Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown volatility with a downward trend, closing lower at 3003.37 from an earlier peak of 3386.15, which suggests a potential bearish sentiment in the market. Correspondingly, the VIX, or fear index, has significantly risen from 16.05 to 36.82, indicating increased market uncertainty and risk aversion among investors. International markets have also experienced declines, with the Nikkei 225 and FTSE 100 indices both trending downwards, closing at 21082.73 and 6718.20 respectively, which could reflect broader global economic concerns. Safe-haven assets like Gold Futures have seen an uptick, peaking at 1672.40 before settling at 1642.10, underscoring investors' flight to safety amidst market turmoil. Despite fluctuations, the currency exchange rates have remained relatively stable; however, the USD has weakened against the JPY, moving from 108.61 to 108.49, which often happens during times of investor caution.
