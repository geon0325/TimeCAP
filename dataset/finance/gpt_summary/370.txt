Over the last 20 market days, the S&P 500 has shown a general upward trend, increasing from 3117.86 to 3251.84, suggesting a growing investor confidence or a market recovery. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, has trended downwards from 31.77 to 24.46, indicating a decrease in investor fear and market uncertainty. International indices such as the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 have experienced fluctuations with the Nikkei showing a slight overall increase and the FTSE 100 displaying more volatility but ultimately making a modest decline. Gold Futures have seen a gradual rise from 1756.70 to 1815.90, reflecting investors' sustained interest in safe-haven assets amidst ongoing economic uncertainty. The exchange rates have remained relatively stable with the EUR/USD and USD/CNY pairings showing slight strengthening of the Euro and the Chinese Yuan against the US Dollar, while the USD/JPY has been fairly stable, all of which could be indicative of the dollar's slight weakening in the forex markets.
