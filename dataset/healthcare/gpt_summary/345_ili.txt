Over the last 20 weeks, the data indicates an upward trend in the percentage of patients with Influenza-like Illness (ILI), surpassing the baseline threshold in recent weeks. While all age groups have experienced increases in ILI cases, the most pronounced rise has occurred in the 25-49 age group, followed by significant upticks in the 0-4 and 5-24 age groups. The elderly population (65 or more) has also shown a growing number of ILI cases, though not as sharply as younger demographics. This steady increase in ILI incidence suggests a growing burden on the healthcare system, potentially necessitating increased healthcare resources, vigilance, and public health interventions to manage the rising demand for medical care. The trend also underscores the need for ongoing surveillance and preventive measures, such as vaccination and public education on illness prevention, to mitigate the impact of ILI on the community's health.
