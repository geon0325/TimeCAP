Over the past 24 hours in San Francisco, temperatures exhibited a natural diurnal pattern with a peak during the late afternoon and a gradual decline through the night into the early morning hours. Humidity levels have fluctuated considerably, indicating the likelihood of varying cloud cover and the potential formation of fog, especially during the times when high humidity coincided with lower temperatures. Air pressure remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting steady weather conditions without the immediate approach of significant weather fronts. Wind speeds varied, with a few instances of higher gusts, which would contribute to a wind chill effect during cooler temperatures and could disperse any fog or low-lying clouds. The wind direction was variable throughout the period, although there were consistent periods where the winds were coming from a northerly or a westerly direction, which is typical for the region's prevailing wind patterns.
